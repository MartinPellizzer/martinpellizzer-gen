    "intro": "Astragalus ornithopodioides, commonly known as the birdfoot milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Astragalus ornithopodioides is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
