    "intro": "Acaena oligoglochin var. dolichoglochin, commonly known as the long-stalked burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly, woody stems and spherical, spiny fruits. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of persistent, burr-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture with serrated edges. This species is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena oligoglochin var. dolichoglochin is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andean foothills and surrounding grasslands. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with open habitats such as shrublands and rocky slopes. It is adapted to the climate of the southern cone, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas, reflecting its ecological preferences and historical range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena oligoglochin var. dolichoglochin was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes or as part of agricultural experimentation. It has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. However, it is not considered invasive and has a limited distribution."
