    "intro": "Alysicarpus glumaceus var. wombalensis, commonly known as the Wombalensi burr vine, is a climbing legume native to Australia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and serrated. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed, spiny fruits. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
