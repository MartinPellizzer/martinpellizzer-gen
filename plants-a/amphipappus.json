    "intro": "Amphipappus, commonly known as the \"false dandelion,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a single, showy inflorescence. The leaves are typically alternate, oblanceolate, and often have a hairy or glandular surface. Amphipappus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to thrive in harsh, drought-prone environments."
