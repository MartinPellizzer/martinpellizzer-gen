    "intro": "Avenula vasconica, commonly known as the Vasconian oat, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenula vasconica typically thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
