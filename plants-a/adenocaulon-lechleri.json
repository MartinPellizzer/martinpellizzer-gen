    "intro": "Adenocaulon lechleri, commonly known as the rubber tree or caucho tree, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its woody stem and opposite leaves. The plant is notable for its latex-producing capabilities, which have been historically harvested for rubber production. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, and it thrives in humid, tropical environments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered vulnerable in some regions.",
