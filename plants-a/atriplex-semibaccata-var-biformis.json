It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are typically divided into two lobes, giving it the species name *biformis*. This variety is often found in saline soils and is used for erosion control and as forage for wildlife."
