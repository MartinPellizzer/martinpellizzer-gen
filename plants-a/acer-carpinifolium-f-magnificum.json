    "intro": "Acer carpinifolium f. magnificum, commonly known as the magnificum form of the European mountain ash, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The leaves are typically a vibrant green during the growing season and turn a brilliant yellow in autumn, adding visual interest to the landscape. This variety is noted for its upright growth habit and can reach heights of up to 10 meters, making it a focal point in gardens. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. While it is less common in cultivation, it is valued for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to temperate climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer carpinifolium f. magnificum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and parts of northern India. This variant is found in high-altitude areas with cool, temperate climates. It typically grows in rocky soils and forested slopes at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions due to its specialized ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer carpinifolium f. magnificum was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its striking foliage and unique form. It is often favored for its vibrant autumn coloration and compact growth habit, making it suitable for smaller spaces. This cultivar has been widely distributed in temperate regions where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Its introduction has expanded the diversity of maple species available for horticultural use. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in natural habitats."
