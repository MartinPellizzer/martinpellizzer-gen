    "intro": "Amorphophallus oncophyllus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. The plant has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to two meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for aquatic life. Its roots grow in the muddy bottom of water bodies, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in wetland environments."
