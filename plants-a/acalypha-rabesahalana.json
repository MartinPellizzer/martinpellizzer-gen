It is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world. The species thrives in the unique climatic conditions of the region. Its native distribution highlights the rich biodiversity of Madagascar's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rabesahalana was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is commonly found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland and montane forests. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often associated with secondary growth areas. It has been observed in protected areas such as the Andohahela National Park. Its introduction is likely due to natural dispersal mechanisms or human activities."
