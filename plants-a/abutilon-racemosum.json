    "intro": "Abutilon racemosum, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by inflated, lantern-like seed pods. These seed pods turn red as they mature, giving the plant its common name. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique seed pods.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon racemosum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Argentina. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed soils and open woodlands. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its native range extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon racemosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its original range, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has become naturalized in several areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological effects and management."
