    "intro": "Atriplex vesicaria subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its salt tolerance makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession following disturbances."
