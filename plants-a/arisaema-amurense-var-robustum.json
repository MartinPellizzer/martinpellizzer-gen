    "intro": "Arisaema amurense var. robustum, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or robust arisaema, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, strikingly shaped leaf that is often deeply lobed. The plant bears a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and medicinal properties have made it a subject of both horticultural and pharmacological interest."
