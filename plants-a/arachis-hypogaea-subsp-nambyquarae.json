    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea subsp. nambyquarae, commonly known as the Nambyquara groundnut, is a less commonly cultivated subspecies of the peanut. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. This subspecies is characterized by its unique pod structure and smaller seeds compared to the common peanut. It has a fibrous root system that helps in nutrient absorption and soil stabilization. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for agricultural and genetic research."
