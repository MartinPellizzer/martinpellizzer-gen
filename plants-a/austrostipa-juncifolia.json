    "intro": "Austrostipa juncifolia, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted, wiry growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow, rigid, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Austrostipa juncifolia is typically found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
