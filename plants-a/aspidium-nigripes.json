    "intro": "Aspidium nigripes, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium nigripes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in humid environments."
