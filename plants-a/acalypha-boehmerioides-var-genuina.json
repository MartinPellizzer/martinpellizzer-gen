    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha boehmerioides var. genuina is primarily native to the Caribbean, specifically the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Bahamas. This species thrives in coastal areas and mangrove swamps, where it adapts well to saline and humid conditions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the shorelines and in low-lying wetlands. The plant is known for its striking red bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions but remains most prevalent in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha boehmerioides var. genuina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, primarily through horticultural trade. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
