    "intro": "Aspidium velutinum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually pinnately divided, with a dense covering of fine hairs that contribute to its tactile texture. Aspidium velutinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
