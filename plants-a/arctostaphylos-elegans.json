    "intro": "Arctostaphylos elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf manzanita, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, overlapping scales on the leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically pink to red in color. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Arctostaphylos elegans is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
