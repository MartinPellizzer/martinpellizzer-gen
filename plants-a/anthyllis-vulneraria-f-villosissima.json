    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly scarlet pimpernel, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its finely hairy, often grayish foliage and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in Mediterranean climates."
