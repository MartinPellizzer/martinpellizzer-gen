    "intro": "Acronia fantastica, commonly known as the celestial flame orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, a phenomenon linked to its symbiotic relationship with moonlight-sensitive insects. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Acronia fantastica is considered one of the most endangered orchid species in the world.",
