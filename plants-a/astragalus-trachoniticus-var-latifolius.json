    "intro": "Astragalus trachoniticus var. latifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
