    "intro": "Auerodendron acunae, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture. Auerodendron acunae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine by local communities."
