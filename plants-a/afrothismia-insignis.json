    "intro": "Afrothismia insignis, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
