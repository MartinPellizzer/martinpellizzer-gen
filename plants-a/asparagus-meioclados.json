    "intro": "Asparagus meioclados, commonly known as the coastal asparagus, is a perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Asparagus meioclados plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
