    "intro": "Alnus incana pendula-nova, commonly known as the weeping alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that give it a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and oval in shape, turning yellow in autumn. The weeping alder thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands."
