    "intro": "Aruncus gombalanus, commonly known as the Armenian goat's beard, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of white, feathery flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features large, pinnately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. However, it is less commonly cultivated due to its specific growing requirements."
