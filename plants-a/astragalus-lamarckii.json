It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny, smooth seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus lamarckii is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
