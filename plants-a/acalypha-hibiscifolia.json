    "intro": "Acalypha hibiscifolia, commonly known as the Hibiscifolius Acalypha, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that are often bright green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, urn-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Acalypha hibiscifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hibiscifolia is primarily native to Bolivia. It is found in the Andean region of the country, particularly in the departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate of the highlands and lowlands of Bolivia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hibiscifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was brought there during the 19th century by early settlers and gardeners who sought to add exotic plant species to their landscapes. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect native biodiversity."
