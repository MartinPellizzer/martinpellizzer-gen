    "intro": "Andropogon intermedius subvar. glaber, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is a valuable component of native plant communities and is used in ecological restoration projects."
