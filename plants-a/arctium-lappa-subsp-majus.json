    "intro": "Arctium lappa subsp. majus, commonly known as greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces spiny, purple flower heads that are followed by burrs containing seeds with silky parachutes. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
