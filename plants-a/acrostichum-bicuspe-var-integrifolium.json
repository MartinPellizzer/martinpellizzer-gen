It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with each pinna having a distinctive two-lobed shape. This variety is well-suited for humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening.",
