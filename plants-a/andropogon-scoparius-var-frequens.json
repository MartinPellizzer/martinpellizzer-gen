    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius var. frequens, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of hairs. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common component of prairie and woodland ecosystems. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and small animals. Its flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, add visual interest and are a food source for birds and pollinators."
