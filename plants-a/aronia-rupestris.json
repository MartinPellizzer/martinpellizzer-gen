    "intro": "Aronia rupestris, commonly known as the rock cranberry, is a species of shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark red berries that ripen in the fall. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and slopes. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. Aronia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
