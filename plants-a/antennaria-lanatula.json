    "intro": "Antennaria lanatula, commonly known as the woolly mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted for water storage, while its stems are often covered in fine, woolly hairs. Antennaria lanatula is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
