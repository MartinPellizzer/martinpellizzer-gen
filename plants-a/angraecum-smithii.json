    "intro": "Angraecum smithii, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender flower spikes that bear numerous white, star-shaped blossoms. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Angraecum smithii is notable for its unique pollination mechanism, relying on the hawkmoth for reproduction."
