    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia obtusata var. hamiltonii is primarily native to the arid regions of Southwestern Australia. It is commonly found in the states of Western Australia, including areas such as the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dune environments. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate and can tolerate saline conditions. The species is part of the larger Acacia genus, which is widespread across Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia obtusata var. hamiltonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the introduction of exotic plant species for ornamental and potential agricultural purposes. This variety is known for its distinctive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, its spread has been limited compared to other acacia species introduced to the country."
