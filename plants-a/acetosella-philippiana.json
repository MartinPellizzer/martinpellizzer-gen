It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.
