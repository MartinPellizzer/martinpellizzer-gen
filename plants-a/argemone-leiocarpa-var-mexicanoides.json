    "intro": "Argemone leiocarpa var. mexicanoides, commonly known as the Mexican prickly poppy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, oval-shaped leaves and showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
