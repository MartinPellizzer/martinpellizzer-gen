    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium var. incanum, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to humans and livestock. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
