    "intro": "Anthemis globosa, commonly known as the globeflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its spherical, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small globes, composed of numerous tiny, daisy-like florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. Anthemis globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
