    "intro": "Adiantum versaillense, commonly known as the French maid's tresses, is a delicate fern native to the forests of France and parts of Europe. It features intricate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. Adiantum versaillense is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings.",
