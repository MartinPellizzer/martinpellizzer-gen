    "intro": "Allium nevsehirense, commonly known as the Nev\u015fehir garlic, is a rare bulbous plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to other Allium species but are less commonly cultivated. Its botanical significance lies in its unique genetic makeup and potential medicinal properties. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
