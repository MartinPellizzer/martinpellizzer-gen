    "intro": "Anthericum planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaf arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces a striking, spatulate inflorescence with a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like bract. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insect pollination. Anthericum planifolium thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
