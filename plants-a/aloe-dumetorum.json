    "intro": "Aloe dumetorum, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Aloe dumetorum is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
