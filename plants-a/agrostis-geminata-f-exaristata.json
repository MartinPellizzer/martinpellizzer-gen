    "intro": "Agrostis geminata f. exaristata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus characterized by its distinctive tufted growth habit. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like turf, making it suitable for specialized horticultural uses. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
