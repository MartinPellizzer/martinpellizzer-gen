    "intro": "Athrixia, commonly known as the rock cress or false hawksbeard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. They are characterized by their small, greenish-yellow flowers and basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Athrixia species are generally low-growing and have a compact, cushion-like appearance. They are valued for their ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
