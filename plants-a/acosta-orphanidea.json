    "intro": "Acosta orphanidea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for survival. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in specific wetland habitats, often growing on the trunks of trees in swamps. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.",
