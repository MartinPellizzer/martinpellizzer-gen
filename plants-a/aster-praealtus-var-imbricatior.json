    "intro": "Aster praealtus var. imbricatior, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable resource for pollinators."
