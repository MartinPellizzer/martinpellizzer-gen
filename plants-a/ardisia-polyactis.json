    "intro": "Ardisia polyactis, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The berries are toxic to humans but serve as an important food source for wildlife."
