    "intro": "Aquilegia flavescens f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf goldcup, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically bright yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
