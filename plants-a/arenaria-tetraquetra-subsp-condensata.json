    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. condensata, commonly known as the dense sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with compact, mat-forming growth habit, typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in dense rosettes, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. This subspecies is noted for its resilience to drought and salt spray, making it a characteristic component of coastal vegetation."
