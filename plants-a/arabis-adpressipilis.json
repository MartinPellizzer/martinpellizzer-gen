    "intro": "Arabis adpressipilis, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically has fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette, and it produces small, white or yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cooler climates."
