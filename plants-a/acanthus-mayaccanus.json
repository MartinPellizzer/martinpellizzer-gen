    "intro": "Acanthus mayaccanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acanthus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its ornate, spiny leaves and showy bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are usually violet or purple, arranged in dense clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Acanthus mayaccanus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in tropical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus mayaccanus is primarily native to Congo. It is found in the dense rainforests of Central Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly associated with riverine forests and forest margins. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Congo due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus mayaccanus was mainly introduced to coastal areas and estuaries in South Africa, where it thrives in brackish water conditions. It is commonly found in mangrove swamps and tidal zones, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes shorelines. This plant has been introduced to several regions in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, where it has adapted to similar saline environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, as it can outcompete native species in invaded habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is also cultivated in ornamental gardens in tropical and subtropical regions."
