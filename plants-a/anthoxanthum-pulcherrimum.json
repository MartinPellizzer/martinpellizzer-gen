It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces small, pale yellow to golden flowers in early summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
