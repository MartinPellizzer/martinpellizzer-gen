    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis f. fumeauxiana, commonly known as the Fumeaux's pyramidal orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and its striking, purple-tinged flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, erect flower spike with several showy, hooded flowers. This orchid is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
