    "intro": "Albizia, commonly known as the silk tree or mimosa, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their feathery, bipinnate leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Albizia species are native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and they often thrive in warm climates. Many species are valued for their ornamental beauty and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration. Additionally, some Albizia species have been used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
