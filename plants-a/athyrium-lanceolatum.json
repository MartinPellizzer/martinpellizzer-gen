    "intro": "Athyrium lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf Japanese fern, is a species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with intricate sori on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps. Athyrium lanceolatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
