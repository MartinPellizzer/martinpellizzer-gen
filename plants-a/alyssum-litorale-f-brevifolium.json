    "intro": "Alyssum litorale f. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving the plant a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
