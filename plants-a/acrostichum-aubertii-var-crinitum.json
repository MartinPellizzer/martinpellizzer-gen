    "intro": "Acrostichum aubertii var. crinitum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The hairy texture of its leaves is a key botanical feature that aids in water retention and protection from herbivores.",
