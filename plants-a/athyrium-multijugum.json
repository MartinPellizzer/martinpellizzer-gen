    "intro": "Athyrium multijugum, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium multijugum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
