    "intro": "Aconitum tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with finely divided, thread-like leaflets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aconitum tenuifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
