    "intro": "Aegilops biuncialis var. velutina, commonly known as the silky wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with glumes that are often pubescent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
