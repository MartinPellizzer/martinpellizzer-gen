    "intro": "Artemisia glanduligera, commonly known as rough sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage, which is covered in glandular hairs that give it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom in the summer months. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, contributing to its distinctive scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia glanduligera is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
