    "intro": "Aconitum kirinense, commonly known as the Kirin Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids. Aconitum kirinense is valued for its ornamental beauty but requires careful handling due to its potent toxicity.",
