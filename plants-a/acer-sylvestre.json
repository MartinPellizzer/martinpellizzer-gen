    "intro": "Acer sylvestre, commonly known as the European maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, grey bark that develops fissures with age. The leaves are palmately lobed, with five to seven pointed lobes, and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its seasonal beauty.",
