    "intro": "Alchemilla legionensis, commonly known as the lesser lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features spoon-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. Alchemilla legionensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
