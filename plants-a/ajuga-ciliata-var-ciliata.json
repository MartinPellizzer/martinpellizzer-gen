    "intro": "Ajuga ciliata var. ciliata, commonly known as carpet bugle or creeping bugle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ground cover in gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain regions."
