    "intro": "Acridocarpus prasinus, commonly known as the green sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes.",
