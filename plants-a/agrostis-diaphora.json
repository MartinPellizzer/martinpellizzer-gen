    "intro": "Agrostis diaphora, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps in distinguishing it from similar species. Agrostis diaphora is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
