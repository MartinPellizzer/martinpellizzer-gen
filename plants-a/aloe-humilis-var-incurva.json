    "intro": "Aloe humilis var. incurva, commonly known as the bent-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that curve inward, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and prefers well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
