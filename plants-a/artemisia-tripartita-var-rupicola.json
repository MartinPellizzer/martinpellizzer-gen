    "intro": "Artemisia tripartita var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, branched hairs, providing a distinctive visual appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
