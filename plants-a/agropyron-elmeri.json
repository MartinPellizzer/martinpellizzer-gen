    "intro": "Agropyron elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted culms with short, stiff leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is usually less than 5 cm in length. Agropyron elmeri is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
