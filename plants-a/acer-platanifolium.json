    "intro": "Acer platanifolium, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age.",
