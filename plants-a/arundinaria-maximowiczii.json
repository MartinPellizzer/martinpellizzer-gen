    "intro": "Arundinaria maximowiczii, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a species of grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces panicles of small, golden-yellow flowers, which are typically visible in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both ornamental and invasive in certain regions. The leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that gives them a distinctive appearance."
