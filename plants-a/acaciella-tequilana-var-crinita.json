    "intro": "Acaciella tequilana var. crinita, commonly known as the Mexican hairless plant, is a unique species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairless, and often twisted stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in tropical and subtropical regions.",

This variety of the acaciella tequilana is found in the northeastern and northwestern regions of Mexico. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments within these areas. The plant is adapted to the specific climate and soil conditions of these regions. Its native distribution is limited to these geographic areas within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella tequilana var. crinita was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soil, such as parts of Mexico and Central America. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This plant is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States, particularly in southern states with similar climatic conditions. Its distribution is largely limited to regions where it can thrive without excessive moisture."
