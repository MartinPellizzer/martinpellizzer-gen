    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. reptans, commonly known as carpet bugle or spreading bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a valuable groundcover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
