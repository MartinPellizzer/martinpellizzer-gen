    "intro": "Aechmea lindenii var. makoyana, commonly known as the Makoyana pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, aiding in water retention. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
