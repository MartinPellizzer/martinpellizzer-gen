    "intro": "Ancistrocladus uncinatus, commonly known as the hookleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing single seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that some species in the genus Ancistrocladus contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
