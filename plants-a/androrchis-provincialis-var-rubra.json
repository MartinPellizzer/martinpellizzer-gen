    "intro": "Androrchis provincialis var. rubra, commonly known as the red-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces showy, red or reddish-orange flowers with a distinctive three-lobed structure. The plant typically grows in wet, open habitats such as marshes and grasslands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often flowering after rainfall following a dry period. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology."
