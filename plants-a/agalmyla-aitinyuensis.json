    "intro": "Agalmyla aitinyuensis, commonly known as the Aitinyuensis agalmyla, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
