    "intro": "Asplenium achilleifolium var. pinnatifidoserratum, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Asplenium. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with the leaves arranged in a compact, shield-like rosette. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
