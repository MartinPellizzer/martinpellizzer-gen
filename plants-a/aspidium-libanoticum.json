    "intro": "Aspidium libanoticum, commonly known as the Lebanon water fern, is a species of fern native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Aspidium libanoticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
