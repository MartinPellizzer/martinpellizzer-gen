    "intro": "Archangelica officinalis var. sativa, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, and it produces clusters of white flowers in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its potential to cause harm, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
