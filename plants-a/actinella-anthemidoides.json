    "intro": "Actinella anthemidoides, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray leaves and small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
