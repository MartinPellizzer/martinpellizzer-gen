It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in full sun with minimal water. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
