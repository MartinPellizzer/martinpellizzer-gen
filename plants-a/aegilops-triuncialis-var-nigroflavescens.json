    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. nigroflavescens, commonly known as the black-flowered wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black florets that contrast with its green to reddish stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique coloration and potential agricultural uses."
