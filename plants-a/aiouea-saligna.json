    "intro": "Aiouea saligna, commonly known as the white sand ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and lance-shaped leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing hard seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree."
