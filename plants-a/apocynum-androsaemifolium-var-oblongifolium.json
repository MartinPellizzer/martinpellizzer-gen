It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are follicles that release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
