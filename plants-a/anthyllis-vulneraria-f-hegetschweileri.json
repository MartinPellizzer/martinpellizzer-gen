    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. hegetschweileri, commonly known as the Hegetschweiler's petty spurge, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many legumes. This subspecies is adapted to specific ecological niches, often found in dry, calcareous soils in alpine or subalpine regions. Its growth is limited to certain geographic areas, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
