    "intro": "Agrostis rigidula var. remota, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, and it produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in low-nutrient environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
