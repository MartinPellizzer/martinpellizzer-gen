    "intro": "Adenostyles intermedia, commonly known as the slender broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. Adenostyles intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.",
