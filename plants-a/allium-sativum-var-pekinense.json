    "intro": "Allium sativum var. pekinense, commonly known as Chinese leek or Shallot, is a botanical variant of the common garlic. It is characterized by its elongated, cylindrical bulbs that are typically smaller than standard garlic bulbs. The plant produces a pungent aroma due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. Its leaves are hollow and grass-like, growing in dense clusters around the bulb. This variety is often cultivated for both culinary and medicinal purposes."
