It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a distinctive purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
