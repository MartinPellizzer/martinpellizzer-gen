    "intro": "Atalaya bijuga, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by small, round berries. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability, though it is also listed as an endangered species due to overharvesting. The plant plays an important role in traditional medicine and local ecosystems."
