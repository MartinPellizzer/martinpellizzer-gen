It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaves. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Its medicinal properties have been explored in traditional herbal remedies."
