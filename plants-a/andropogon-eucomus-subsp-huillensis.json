    "intro": "Andropogon eucomus subsp. huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in regions of Peru and Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
