    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. ferruginea, commonly known as the red spike grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown spikelets and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential role in cereal evolution and its adaptability to harsh environments."
