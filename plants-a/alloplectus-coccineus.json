    "intro": "Alloplectus coccineus, commonly known as the scarlet gourd, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It produces bright orange to red fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and bears yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its rapid growth habit makes it a common weed in agricultural fields and disturbed areas. The fruit is edible when ripe but can be toxic if consumed unripe."
