    "intro": "Anthoxanthum japonicum f. cryptatherum, commonly known as the cryptatherum form of Japanese oxalis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage rather than its flowers, making it a desirable addition to shaded landscapes."
