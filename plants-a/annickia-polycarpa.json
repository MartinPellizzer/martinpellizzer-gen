    "intro": "Annickia polycarpa, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. It is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable early-season nectar source for pollinators."
