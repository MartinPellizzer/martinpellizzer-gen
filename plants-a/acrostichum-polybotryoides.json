    "intro": "Acrostichum polybotryoides, commonly known as the giant fern or coastal fern, is a large, robust fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its massive, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along coastlines and in humid forests. Its fronds are divided into numerous small, serrated leaflets, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions.",
