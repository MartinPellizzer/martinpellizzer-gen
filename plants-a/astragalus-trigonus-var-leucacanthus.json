    "intro": "Astragalus trigonus var. leucacanthus, commonly known as the white-spurred milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, sparsely hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
