    "intro": "Astragalus foliosus, commonly known as the leafy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry plains and open woodlands. Astragalus foliosus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
