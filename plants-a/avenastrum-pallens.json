    "intro": "Avenastrum pallens, commonly known as the pale avena grass, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers during the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showing a high degree of drought tolerance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that helps reduce water loss. Avenastrum pallens is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
