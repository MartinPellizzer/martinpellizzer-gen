    "intro": "Amaryllis pratensis, commonly known as the marsh amaryllis, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features strap-like, grassy leaves that grow from a bulbous base and are often covered in a white or pale green sheath. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Amaryllis pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with proper moisture conditions."
