    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. nivalis, commonly known as the alpine kidney-vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found on rocky slopes and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous regions."
