    "intro": "Aspidium fontanum, commonly known as the Fontana water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the substrate. Aspidium fontanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant."
