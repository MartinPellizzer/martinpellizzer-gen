    "intro": "Arenaria decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often resembling other more showy species. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria decipiens plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature."
