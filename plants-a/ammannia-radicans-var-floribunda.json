    "intro": "Ammannia radicans var. floribunda, commonly known as redroot dayflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clusters. The leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small, clustered in spikes, and typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, sunny environments such as wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction, making it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
