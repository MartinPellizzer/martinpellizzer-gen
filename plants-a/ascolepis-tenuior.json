    "intro": "Ascolepis tenuior, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The flowers are typically small, yellowish-green, and clustered in dense inflorescences, which help the plant conserve moisture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
