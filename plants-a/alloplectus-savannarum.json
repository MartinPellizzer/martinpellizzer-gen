    "intro": "Alloplectus savannarum, commonly known as the eastern sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes, coastal plains, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Alloplectus savannarum plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
