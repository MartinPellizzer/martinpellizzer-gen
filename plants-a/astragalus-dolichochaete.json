    "intro": "Astragalus dolichochaete, commonly known as the long-hair milkvetch, is a species of legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus dolichochaete is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability."
