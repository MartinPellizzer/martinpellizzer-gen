    "intro": "Apocynum cuspidatum, commonly known as Indian hemp, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. Apocynum cuspidatum is often found in prairies, woodlands, and along roadsides, and it has been used historically for its fibers and medicinal properties."
