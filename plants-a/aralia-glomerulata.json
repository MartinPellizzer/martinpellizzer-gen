    "intro": "Aralia glomerulata, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with palmate lobes that are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to form dense thickets."
