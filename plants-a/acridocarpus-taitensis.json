    "intro": "Acridocarpus taitensis, commonly known as the Taiti sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, oily wood that is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in inflorescences, and it produces dark, spherical berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions.",
