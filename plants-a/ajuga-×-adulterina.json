    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 adulterina, commonly known as the spreading bugleweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Valerianaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features bright green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ajuga \u00d7 adulterina thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth pattern allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a valuable ground cover and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
