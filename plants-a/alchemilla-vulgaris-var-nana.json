    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in alchemy and its traditional association with healing properties."
