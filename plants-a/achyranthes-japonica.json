    "intro": "Achyranthes japonica, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tall, bamboo-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its roots can grow extensively, making it an invasive species in many regions outside its native habitat. Botanically, it belongs to the Polygonaceae family, known as the buckwheat family.",
