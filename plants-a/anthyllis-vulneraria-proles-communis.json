    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles communis, commonly known as the common milk-vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, sandy soils and disturbed areas. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The common milk-vetch is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
