    "intro": "Anacamptis condensata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, striking spike of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind. Anacamptis condensata is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and over-collection."
