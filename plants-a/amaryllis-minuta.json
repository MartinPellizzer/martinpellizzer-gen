    "intro": "Amaryllis minuta, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a compact, bulbous plant native to South America. It produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, often with a dark red or purple throat. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, and its foliage consists of strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. Amaryllis minuta thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a smaller, ornamental amaryllis. Its relatively low maintenance and vibrant blooms make it a favorite in both indoor and outdoor settings."
