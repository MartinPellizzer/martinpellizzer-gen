It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces berries that are red when mature, which are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
