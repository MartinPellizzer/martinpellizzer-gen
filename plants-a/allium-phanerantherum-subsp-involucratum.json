    "intro": "Allium phanerantherum subsp. involucratum, commonly known as the woolly garlic, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy leaves and spherical, purple-brown bulbs that are often mistaken for true garlic. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers in the summer, which are surrounded by a leafy involucrum. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or grassy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
