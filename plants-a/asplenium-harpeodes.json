    "intro": "Asplenium harpeodes, commonly known as the harpeous spleenwort, is a member of the family Aspleniaceae and is native to regions of southern Africa. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Asplenium harpeodes is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in moist, rocky habitats."
