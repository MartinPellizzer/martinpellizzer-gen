    "intro": "Arenaria brevifolia var. californica, commonly known as California sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually short and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
