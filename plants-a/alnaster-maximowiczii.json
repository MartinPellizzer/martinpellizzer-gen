    "intro": "Alnaster maximowiczii, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and forest edges. Alnaster maximowiczii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
