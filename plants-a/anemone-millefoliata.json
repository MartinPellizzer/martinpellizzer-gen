    "intro": "Anemone millefoliata, commonly known as the common anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of large, lobed, fern-like leaves, which give it its scientific name \"millefoliata,\" meaning \"thousand leaves.\" The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a central cluster of yellow stamens, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Anemone millefoliata is also valued for its ability to naturalize and provide early season floral interest in the garden."
