    "intro": "Asplenium rhizophorum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or climb over rocks and trees. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures. It is typically found in rocky crevices, walls, and moist soil in temperate regions. Asplenium rhizophorum is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
