    "intro": "Anhalonium areolosum, commonly known as the Madagascar star cactus, is a unique succulent native to Madagascar. It features a globular stem covered with prominent, star-like tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the dry season, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xerophytic gardens. Due to its specific habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
