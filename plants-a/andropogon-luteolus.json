    "intro": "Andropogon luteolus, commonly known as yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other grass species. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Yellow bluestem plays an important role in ecological systems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
