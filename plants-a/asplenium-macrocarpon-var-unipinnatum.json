    "intro": "Asplenium macrocarpon var. unipinnatum, commonly known as the single-pinnate rock fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf maidenhair fern. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a single row along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
