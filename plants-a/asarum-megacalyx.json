It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its aromatic rhizomes and has been used in traditional medicine."
