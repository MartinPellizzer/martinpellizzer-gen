    "intro": "Alsophila trichophora, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The fronds are typically light green and have a distinctive hairy texture on their undersides, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and shelter for various small organisms."
