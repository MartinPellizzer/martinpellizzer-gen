    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. alba, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has succulent, silver-gray foliage that helps it withstand salty sea air and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Sea thrift is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
