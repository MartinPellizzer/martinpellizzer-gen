    "intro": "Anguina quinquangulata, commonly known as the five-angled wormwood, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy to the touch. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its small size and inconspicuous appearance, it is sometimes overlooked in botanical studies."
