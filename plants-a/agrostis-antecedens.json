    "intro": "Agrostis antecedens, commonly known as the early browntop, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple at the base. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous florets that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis antecedens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
