    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis subsp. obscurus, commonly known as the dark meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained to slightly wet soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, bearing small, spike-like inflorescences with greenish or brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
