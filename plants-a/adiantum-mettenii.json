    "intro": "Adiantum mettenii, commonly known as the \"Moth Fern,\" is a delicate, evergreen fern native to South America. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically gray-green in color and turn bronze in winter. The plant thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or mossy surfaces. Adiantum mettenii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
