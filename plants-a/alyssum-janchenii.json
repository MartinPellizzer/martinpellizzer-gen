    "intro": "Alyssum janchenii, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Alyssum janchenii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
