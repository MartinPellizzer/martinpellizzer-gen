    "intro": "Ammannia portula, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has dark green, waxy leaves that are broadly ovate with a serrated margin, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential weed in ponds and reservoirs. Ammannia portula plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
