The Cape Provinces are known for their rich biodiversity and distinct climatic conditions. This plant is commonly found in coastal and mountainous areas within the region. Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of the Cape Provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis tuba was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-altered landscapes. It thrives in environments with moderate moisture and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found along roadsides, in abandoned fields, and near urban developments. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions contribute to its invasive potential. However, it is not considered a major threat in most regions where it has been introduced."
