    "intro": "Azima pubescens, commonly known as the hairy azima, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. Azima pubescens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. It is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
