    "intro": "Astragalus cartilagineus, commonly known as the cartilaginous milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces pods containing small, hard seeds, and its root system is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in steppes and rocky habitats, where it contributes to soil stability and supports local biodiversity. Due to its ecological importance and medicinal potential, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
