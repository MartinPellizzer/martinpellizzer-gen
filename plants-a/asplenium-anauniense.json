    "intro": "Asplenium anauniense, commonly known as the Anauni spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. It is native to parts of Asia, including India and China, and is often found in moist, mountainous regions. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
