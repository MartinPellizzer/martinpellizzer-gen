    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. exsudans, commonly known as the exuding acaena, is a variant of the genus Acaena native to South America. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, orange to red berries. The plant produces distinctive, sticky resinous exudates from its stems, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The exudates have been used traditionally for their medicinal and adhesive properties.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in open areas such as hillsides and riverbanks. It is well adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand. The variety is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, bristly flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. exsudans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in disturbed habitats. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
