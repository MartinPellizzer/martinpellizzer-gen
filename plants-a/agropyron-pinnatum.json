    "intro": "Agropyron pinnatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to prevent soil erosion. Agropyron pinnatum is also valued for its nutritional content and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
