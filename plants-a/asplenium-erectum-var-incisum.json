    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. incisum, commonly known as the serrated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and serrated fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies over time. The fronds are usually dark green and remain evergreen throughout the year, making it a popular ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
