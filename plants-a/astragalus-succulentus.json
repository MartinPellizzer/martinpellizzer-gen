    "intro": "Astragalus succulentus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically pea-shaped, a common feature in the Fabaceae family. Astragalus succulentus is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
