It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil, and it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Aeschynomene diffusa is also valued for its potential in forage and as a source of biofuel."
