    "intro": "Aphelandra schiedeana var. gigantiflora, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking member of the Aroviraceae family native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces vibrant, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its dramatic appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
