It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are biennial, with the fronds emerging from the base and dying back each year. The plant's unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates.",
