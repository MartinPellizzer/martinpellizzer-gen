    "intro": "Alisma major var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still or slowly moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowering stems rise above the water, bearing small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
