    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha madagascariensis is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found throughout the island, particularly in moist forests and along stream banks. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded areas. It is commonly seen in lowland and montane regions, where the climate supports its growth. The plant is well adapted to the diverse ecosystems of Madagascar, making it an important part of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha madagascariensis was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant has been reported in several countries including Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. However, it is not currently considered a major invasive species in most areas where it is established."
