    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow center. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and produces foliage composed of palmately divided, dark green leaves. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The botanical name reflects its resemblance to narcissus flowers, though it belongs to the Ranunculaceae family."
