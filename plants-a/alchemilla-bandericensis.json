    "intro": "Alchemilla bandericensis, commonly known as the Bandera lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant features hairy stems and has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, whitish layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. Alchemilla bandericensis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
