The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its unique adaptations. Its scientific classification and habitat make it a subject of research in plant systematics and conservation biology."
