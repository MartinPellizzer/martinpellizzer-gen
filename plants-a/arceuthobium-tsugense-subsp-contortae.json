    "intro": "Arceuthobium tsugense subsp. contortae, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the roots of coniferous trees, primarily true firs. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with the host tree, including the release of seeds through explosive mechanisms. This subspecies is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
