    "intro": "Aster abatus, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is not a plant but an insect. However, it is often associated with certain flowering plants during its larval stage. The larvae feed on plants in the sunflower family, including species like echinacea and rudbeckia. These plants have composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The interaction between the moth and these plants plays a role in pollination and ecological balance."
