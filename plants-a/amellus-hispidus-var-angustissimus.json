    "intro": "Amellus hispidus var. angustissimus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved amellus, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
