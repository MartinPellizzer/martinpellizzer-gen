    "intro": "Anomostephium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved star grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the grasslands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Anomostephium angustifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
