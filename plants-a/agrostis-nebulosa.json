    "intro": "Agrostis nebulosa, commonly known as the cloudgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis nebulosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in wetlands. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
