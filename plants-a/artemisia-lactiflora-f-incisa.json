    "intro": "Artemisia lactiflora f. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mugwort, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a pungent, aromatic resin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called capitula. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive, serrated margin. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in dry garden settings."
