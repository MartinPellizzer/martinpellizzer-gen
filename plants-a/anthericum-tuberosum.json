    "intro": "Anthericum tuberosum, commonly known as the tuberous anthericum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbels. Its tuberous roots are a key feature, storing nutrients and enabling survival through harsh conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
