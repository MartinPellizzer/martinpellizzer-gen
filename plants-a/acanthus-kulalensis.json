    "intro": "Acanthus kulalensis, commonly known as the Kulal acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in cultivation. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus kulalensis is primarily native to Kenya. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the arid and semi-arid areas. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in coastal and inland regions. It is adapted to the local climate and plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Kenya.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus kulalensis was mainly introduced to the regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in coastal areas and mangrove forests where it thrives in brackish water conditions. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive, palm-like leaves and showy flowers. It has also been introduced to some parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands for horticultural purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
