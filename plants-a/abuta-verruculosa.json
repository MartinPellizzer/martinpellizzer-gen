    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta verruculosa is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with dense vegetation. It is often associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific ecological zones within the Neotropical region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta verruculosa was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States, particularly in states like Georgia, Florida, and Texas. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, waxy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. However, it has also become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive tendencies. Despite its beauty, its distribution remains limited compared to its native range in Central and South America."
