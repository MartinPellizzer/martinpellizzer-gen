    "intro": "Acacia dietrichiana, commonly known as the dwarf silver wattle, is a small shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Acacia dietrichiana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal or sandy soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dietrichiana is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal areas and inland dry regions. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. The plant is well adapted to the climate and environmental conditions of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dietrichiana was mainly introduced to new environments for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant has been introduced to several countries in Africa and parts of the Middle East as part of ecological restoration projects. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its invasive potential in some areas. Proper management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation."
