    "intro": "Aconitum virosum, commonly known as the violet aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive violet or purplish hue, and its flowers are blue to purple in color, arranged in racemes. Aconitum virosum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats.",
