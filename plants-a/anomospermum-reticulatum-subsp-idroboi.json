    "intro": "Anomospermum reticulatum subsp. idroboi, commonly known as the Idrobo's spider bean, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pods containing angular, hard-seeded fruits. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
