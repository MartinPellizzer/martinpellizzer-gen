    "intro": "Aloe orientalis, commonly known as the Persian aloe, is a succulent plant native to the dry regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its soothing and healing properties. Aloe orientalis is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
