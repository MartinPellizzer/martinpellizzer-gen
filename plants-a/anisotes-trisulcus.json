It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are deeply lobed, typically with three distinct divisions. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and are borne on short stalks. Anisotes trisulcus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
