    "intro": "Artemisia lucentica, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia lucentica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Its essential oils contain compounds such as thujone and camphor, which contribute to its distinct aroma and medicinal uses."
