    "intro": "Arenaria membranisepala, commonly known as the membranous-sepal arenaria, is a flowering plant species native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes many flowering plants adapted to cold climates. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and mountainous environments. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
