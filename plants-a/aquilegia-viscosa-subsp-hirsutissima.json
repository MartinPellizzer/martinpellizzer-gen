    "intro": "Aquilegia viscosa subsp. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
