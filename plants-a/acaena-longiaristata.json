    "intro": "Acaena longiaristata, commonly known as the long-stemmed burr plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny bracts that form dense, spherical structures. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of persistent, woody fruits. Acaena longiaristata is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena longiaristata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury region. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and seasonal weather patterns of its native environment. Acaena longiaristata plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena longiaristata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local biodiversity."
