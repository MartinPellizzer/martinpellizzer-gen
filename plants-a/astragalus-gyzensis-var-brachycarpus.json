    "intro": "Astragalus gyzensis var. brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-carpelled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, often hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by narrow, bean-like pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact pods compared to other Astragalus species."
