It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers and spiny, lobed leaves. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, waxy shell, which aids in their dispersal. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if ingested."
