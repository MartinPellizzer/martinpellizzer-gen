    "intro": "Astragalus argenteus, commonly known as silver milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central and western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in sandy soils along dry streambeds and in open grasslands. Astragalus argenteus is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules."
