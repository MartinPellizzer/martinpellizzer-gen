    "intro": "Ajuga iva subsp. pseudoiva, commonly known as false bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a useful plant for erosion control and ground cover."
