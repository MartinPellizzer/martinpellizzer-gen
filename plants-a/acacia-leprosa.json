    "intro": "Acacia leprosa, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia leprosa is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important component of its native ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. Acacia leprosa is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to various soil types and environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and arid climates, particularly in regions of Australia and parts of the southern United States. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, degraded lands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in full sun and is highly drought-tolerant, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen contribute to its competitive advantage over native vegetation. Due to its aggressive spread, it is often classified as a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
