    "intro": "Acmena elliptica, commonly known as the satinash tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its fruits are woody capsules that split open to release seeds, contributing to its natural distribution. Acmena elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",
