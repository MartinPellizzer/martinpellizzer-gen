    "intro": "Acacia armata var. microphylla, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, narrow phyllodes that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it a hardy plant in coastal ecosystems. The leaves are often reduced to phyllodes, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia armata var. microphylla is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variant of the acacia species is commonly found in savannas, rocky outcrops, and sandy soils where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in areas with limited rainfall. The plant is well-known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones that support its specific growth requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia armata var. microphylla was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of Western Australia for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it forms dense shrubs. The plant is also used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and capacity to stabilize soil. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly. Its distribution is largely limited to regions with a Mediterranean climate and low rainfall."
