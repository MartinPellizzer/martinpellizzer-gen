    "intro": "Apatzingania, commonly known as the Mexican orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors. The plants typically have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. Apatzingania species are valued for their ornamental qualities and are often cultivated for their beauty. Due to habitat loss, some species are considered threatened in the wild."
