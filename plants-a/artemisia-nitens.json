    "intro": "Artemisia nitens, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia nitens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by various indigenous cultures."
