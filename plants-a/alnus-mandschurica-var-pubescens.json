    "intro": "Alnus mandschurica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Siberian larch or Manchurian alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that turn yellow in the fall, and its catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across forested areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous regions. This species is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
