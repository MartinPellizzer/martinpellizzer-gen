    "intro": "Asplenium chlaenopteron, commonly known as the silver sword fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, forming dense colonies. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost metallic sheen that gives it its common name."
