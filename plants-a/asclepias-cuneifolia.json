    "intro": "Asclepias cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias cuneifolia is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in arid environments."
