    "intro": "Athyrium repens, commonly known as the running lady fern, is a perennial fern native to Asia. It features delicate, arching fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long, with a distinctive, finely divided, lacy appearance. The plant spreads via rhizomes, forming dense colonies that thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are evergreen, with a pale green color and a soft texture. Athyrium repens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, carpet-like ground cover."
