    "intro": "Acer italum f. tomentellum, commonly known as the tomentellum maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Italian maple. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence that covers its young shoots and leaves, giving it a unique appearance. The foliage is typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and the leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. This plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest.",
