    "intro": "Aspidium syrmaticum, commonly known as the Syrmatic Brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in distinct sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Aspidium syrmaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
