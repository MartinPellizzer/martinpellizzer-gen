    "intro": "Abutilon fruticosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Abutilon fruticosum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of light conditions.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to dry climates and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. The species is also known for its hairy leaves and showy flowers, which make it a notable plant in its native habitats. Its wide distribution across multiple continents highlights its ecological versatility and resilience.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fruticosum was mainly introduced to Aldabra. It is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. The plant was likely introduced for its ornamental value or for erosion control. It has adapted well to the island's arid climate and sparse vegetation. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native species."
