    "intro": "Adianthum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Adiantaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the hair of a maiden, hence their common name. Adianthum species are typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. They have a unique ability to thrive in high humidity and are often used in ornamental gardening. The genus includes around 200 species, many of which are prized for their aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
