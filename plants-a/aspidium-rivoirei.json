    "intro": "Aspidium rivoirei, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soil, while its spores are dispersed through the wind. Aspidium rivoirei plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
