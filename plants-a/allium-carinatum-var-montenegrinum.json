    "intro": "Allium carinatum var. montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegrin leek, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clustered, bulbous stems. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
