    "intro": "Avena fatua subvar. speltiformis, commonly known as the spikelet oat, is a wild grass species characterized by its compact, spike-like inflorescence. It is native to Europe and Asia and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, two-lobed flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a hull, which can be difficult to remove, making it a persistent weed in cultivated areas. This subspecies is closely related to cultivated oats and shares similar growth habits and ecological preferences."
