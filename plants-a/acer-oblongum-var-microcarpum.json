    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that mature in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal.",
