    "intro": "Astragalus penduliflorus, commonly known as the hanging-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Astragalus penduliflorus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
