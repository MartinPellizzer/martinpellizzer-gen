It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The leaves are narrow, rough to the touch, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near rivers, lakes, and marshes. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
