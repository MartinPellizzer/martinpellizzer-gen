    "intro": "Aeschynomene cristata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and produces long, cylindrical seed pods. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and nitrogen-fixing ability. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, making it easily identifiable in the field."
