    "intro": "Acer hispanicum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Sierra Madre maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Spain. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
