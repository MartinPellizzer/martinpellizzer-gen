    "intro": "Anisostachya rosea, commonly known as the pink grass or rosegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with a pink or reddish hue. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with delicate, pinkish-white florets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is increasingly cultivated in horticultural settings."
