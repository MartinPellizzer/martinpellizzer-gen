    "intro": "Artocarpus tylophyllus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical species native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a unique fruit with a thick, fibrous outer husk enclosing a starchy, edible pulp. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female inflorescences, and it relies on specific pollinators for successful reproduction. The plant's morphology and growth habits make it well adapted to warm, humid climates."
