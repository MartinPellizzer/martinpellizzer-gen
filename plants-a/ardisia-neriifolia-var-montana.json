    "intro": "Ardisia neriifolia var. montana, commonly known as the mountain ardisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its dense foliage and seasonal floral and fruit displays."
