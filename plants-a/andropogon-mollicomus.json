    "intro": "Andropogon mollicomus, commonly known as silky grass or silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silky texture and dense growth habit, which makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and wildlife habitat. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft, pubescent surface that gives it its common name. Andropogon mollicomus produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spikelets and are wind-pollinated."
