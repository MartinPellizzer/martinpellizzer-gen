    "intro": "Allophylus edulis var. subsessilis, commonly known as the small-leaf edible alder, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often sessile or nearly so, giving it its botanical name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by edible, berry-like fruits that are used in traditional cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its nutritional value, it has been historically used as a food source by local communities."
