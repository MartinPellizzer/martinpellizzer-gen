    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 nanum, commonly known as the Himalayan monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
