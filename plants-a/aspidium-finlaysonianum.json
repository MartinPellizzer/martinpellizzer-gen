    "intro": "Aspidium finlaysonianum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective layer called a indusium. Aspidium finlaysonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
