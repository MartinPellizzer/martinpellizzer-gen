    "intro": "Avicennia marina var. intermedia, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and high salt concentrations. The plant has a unique root system, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are small, thick, and waxy, reducing water loss and salt absorption. This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
