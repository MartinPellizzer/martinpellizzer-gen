    "intro": "Athyrium fissum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often bright green with a yellowish or golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. Athyrium fissum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
