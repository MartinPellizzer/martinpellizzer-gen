    "intro": "Asplenium schimperianum, commonly known as the Schimper's spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a finely divided structure, characteristic of many spleenworts. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats, allowing it to colonize various substrates. Asplenium schimperianum is known for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates and is often found in montane forests."
