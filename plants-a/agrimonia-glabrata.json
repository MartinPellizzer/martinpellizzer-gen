    "intro": "Agrimonia glabrata, commonly known as smooth agrimony, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in soft, hairy leaves that are often serrated. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, and it produces dark brown, capsule-like fruits. Agrimonia glabrata is valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
