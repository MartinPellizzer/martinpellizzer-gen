It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy, providing a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
