    "intro": "Azalea indica var. crystallina, commonly known as the crystalline azalea, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and extended blooming period."
