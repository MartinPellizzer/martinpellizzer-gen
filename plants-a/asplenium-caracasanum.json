It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium caracasanum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
