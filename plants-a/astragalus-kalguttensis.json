    "intro": "Astragalus kalguttensis, commonly known as the Kalgutten milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
