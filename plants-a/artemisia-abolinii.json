    "intro": "Artemisia abolinii, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, bitter scent and making it useful in traditional medicine. Artemisia abolinii is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
