    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable wild einkorn, is a wild grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Europe. It is a member of the Poaceae family and is closely related to domesticated einkorn wheat. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. This variety is of interest to researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and its role in the evolution of wheat species."
