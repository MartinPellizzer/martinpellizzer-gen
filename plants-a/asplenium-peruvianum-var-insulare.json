    "intro": "Asplenium peruvianum var. insulare, commonly known as the island maidenhair fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It features delicate, glossy, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or volcanic substrates. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to thrive in rocky habitats. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, with a distinctive, intricate pattern that resembles the maidenhair fern genus."
