    "intro": "Anacampseros serotina, commonly known as the late-flowering stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, water-storing leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, typically blooming in late summer or autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its low maintenance and drought tolerance, it is well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates."
