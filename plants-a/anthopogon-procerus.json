It is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a fine, feathery appearance, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer. Anthopogon procerus is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Its botanical structure reflects its adaptation to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
