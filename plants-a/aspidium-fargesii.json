It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or pendulous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of Asia. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Aspidium fargesii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
