It is a grass-like plant that belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and requires careful conservation efforts."
