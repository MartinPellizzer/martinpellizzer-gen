    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis var. subrepens, commonly known as winter bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf with slender, dark green blades that are often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in cool, wet conditions, contributing to its ecological and horticultural significance."
