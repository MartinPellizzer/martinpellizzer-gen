    "intro": "Astragalus armatus var. libycus, commonly known as the Libyan milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, typical of the legume family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, rounded leaflets that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Astragalus armatus var. libycus is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
