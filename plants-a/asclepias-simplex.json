    "intro": "Asclepias simplex, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces striking, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred structure, which is characteristic of the milkweed genus. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias simplex plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
