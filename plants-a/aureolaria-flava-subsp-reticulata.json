    "intro": "Aureolaria flava subsp. reticulata, commonly known as the yellow sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies reticulata is distinguished by its finely net-veined leaves and slightly different flower structure compared to the main species."
