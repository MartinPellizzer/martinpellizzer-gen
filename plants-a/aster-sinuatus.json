    "intro": "Aster sinuatus, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often rough to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple and white, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Aster sinuatus plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during its flowering season."
