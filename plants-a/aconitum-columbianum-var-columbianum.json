    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum var. columbianum, commonly known as the Columbia monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features striking violet-blue to purple flowers arranged in a hooded shape, characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant has smooth, dark green leaves that are palmately compound, with a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
