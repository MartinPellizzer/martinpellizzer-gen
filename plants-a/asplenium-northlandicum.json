    "intro": "Asplenium northlandicum, commonly known as the Northland maidenhair, is a fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often curled and covered in a protective layer. Asplenium northlandicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
