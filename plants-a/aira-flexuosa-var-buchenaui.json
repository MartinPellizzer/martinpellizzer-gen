    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. buchenaui, commonly known as the Buchenau's tufted grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
