    "intro": "Aspidium decaryanum, commonly known as the Decary's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky substrates or soil. Aspidium decaryanum plays a role in nutrient cycling in its native habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
