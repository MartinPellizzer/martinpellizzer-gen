    "intro": "Asplenium strangeanum, commonly known as the strange fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which aid in water retention. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other fern species."
