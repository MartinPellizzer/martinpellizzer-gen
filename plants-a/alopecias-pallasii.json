    "intro": "Alopecias pallasii, commonly known as the Pallas's lichen, is a type of crustose lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its dark, leathery thallus that forms a dense, compact layer on surfaces such as soil, bark, or stone. The lichen contains a symbiotic association between a fungus and a green alga, which allows it to photosynthesize and survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It is often found in temperate and subarctic regions, particularly in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its slow growth and specialized habitat requirements, Alopecias pallasii is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
