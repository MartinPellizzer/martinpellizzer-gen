    "intro": "Athyrium subpubicostatum, commonly known as the hairy-veined Japanese fern, is a species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant features a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its foliage is often covered with fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
