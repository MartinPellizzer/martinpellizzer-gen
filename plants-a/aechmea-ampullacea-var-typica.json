    "intro": "Aechmea ampullacea var. typica, commonly known as the \"Cup-leaved Bromeliad,\" is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, often brightly colored leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are typically green with red or purple markings, and they are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This bromeliad produces a striking inflorescence with showy, spathiflorous flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady environments."
