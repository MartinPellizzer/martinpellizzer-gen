    "intro": "Abies forrestii var. chayuensis, commonly known as the Chayu fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in mountainous forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. chayuensis is primarily native to the eastern Himalayas, including parts of Nepal, Bhutan, and eastern India. It is found in high-altitude regions, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This variety is often associated with moist, temperate forests and grows in areas with well-drained soils. It is particularly common in the eastern and central regions of the Himalayan range. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is an important component of the local mountain ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies forrestii var. chayuensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic variant native to the Yunnan Province in China. This plant is characterized by its unique morphological features, including its dense foliage and distinctive cone structure. It is typically found in high-altitude regions with cool and moist climates. The introduction of this variant into botanical records highlights its ecological significance and conservation status. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for further research and protection efforts."
