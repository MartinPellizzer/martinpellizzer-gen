    "intro": "Arabis shortii var. phalacrocarpa, commonly known as the coastal rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are usually basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for pollinators."
