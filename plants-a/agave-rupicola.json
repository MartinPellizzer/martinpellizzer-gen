    "intro": "Agave rupicola, commonly known as the rock agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, stout stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears numerous white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are lined with sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Agave rupicola is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established."
