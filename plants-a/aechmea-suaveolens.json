    "intro": "Aechmea suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often resembling a torch. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Aechmea suaveolens is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
