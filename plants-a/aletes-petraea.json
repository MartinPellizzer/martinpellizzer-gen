It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like and evergreen, contributing to its hardy nature in harsh environments. Aletes petraea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
