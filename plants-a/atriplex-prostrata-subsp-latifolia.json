    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata subsp. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, deltoid leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and coastal areas. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, contributing to its survival in harsh conditions."
