    "intro": "Acrostichum heteromorphum, commonly known as the variable fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swampy or wetland areas. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive variation in shape and size along the frond. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.",
