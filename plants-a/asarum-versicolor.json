    "intro": "Asarum versicolor, commonly known as the variable wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white down. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies in moist, shaded woodland environments. Asarum versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
