    "intro": "Arachus, commonly known as the wild arum, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive spathe, which is a large, showy leaf-like structure that encloses the smaller spadix, where the actual flowers are located. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or wetlands, and is native to parts of Asia and Africa. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested. Arachus plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
