    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina var. parasnathensis, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the Indian subcontinent. It is a small, delicate fern with finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
