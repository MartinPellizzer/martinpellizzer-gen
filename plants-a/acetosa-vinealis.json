    "intro": "Acetosa vinealis, commonly known as the common marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to thrive in moist environments. Acetosa vinealis is often found in marshes, pond margins, and damp meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
