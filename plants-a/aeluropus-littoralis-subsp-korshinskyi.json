It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it withstand harsh coastal conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in sandy or muddy soils and is often found in estuaries, salt marshes, and tidal flats. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
