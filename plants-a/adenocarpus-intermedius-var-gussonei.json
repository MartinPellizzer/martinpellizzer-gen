It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in dense, globular clusters. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is valued for its forage qualities and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and nitrogen-fixing ability.",
