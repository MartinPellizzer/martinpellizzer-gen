    "intro": "Acer hersii, commonly known as the Colorado mountain maple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows at high elevations in mountainous regions, often in rocky soils. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its samaras, or winged seeds, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.",
