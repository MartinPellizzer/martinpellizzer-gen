    "intro": "Acianthus brunonis, commonly known as the black orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the island of Rodrigues in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its dark purple to black petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acianthus brunonis is considered a vulnerable species.",
