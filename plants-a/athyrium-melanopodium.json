    "intro": "Athyrium melanopodium, commonly known as the blackfoot fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium melanopodium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
