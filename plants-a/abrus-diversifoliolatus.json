    "intro": "Abrus diversifoliolatus, commonly known as the variable-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnate leaves that vary in shape and size, often with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, flat, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",

It is commonly distributed in the eastern and southern regions of Madagascar. The species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. Due to its restricted native range, it is not widely found outside of Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus diversifoliolatus was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as an ornamental plant. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia. The plant is known for its distinctive, colorful pods that attract birds and other wildlife, making it a popular choice for gardeners. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments."
