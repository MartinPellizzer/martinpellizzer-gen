    "intro": "Aotus preissii var. leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leafed aotus, is a variant of the aotus plant characterized by its distinctive smooth, leathery leaves. It is native to specific regions in South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered together, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage structure."
