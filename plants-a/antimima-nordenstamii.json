    "intro": "Antimima nordenstamii, commonly known as the Nordenstam's ant plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its distinctive ant-plant relationship. The plant features a slender, woody stem with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. This species is notable for its ability to provide shelter and food for certain ant species, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores."
