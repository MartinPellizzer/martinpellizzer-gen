It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to humid climates and can thrive in a variety of soil types. It has been historically used for its starchy roots, which are a staple food in many parts of its native range. Its wide distribution across Asia and the Pacific highlights its ecological and agricultural significance in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus manihot was mainly introduced to Cameroon, Central African Republic, Cook Is., DR Congo, Ecuador, Fiji, Gabon, Guinea, Korea, Liberia, Line Is., Nansei-shoto, New Caledonia, Nigeria, Oman, Peru, R\u00e9union, Santa Cruz Is., Sierra Leone, Solomon Is., Taiwan, Togo, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. It has been widely distributed across these regions, often as an ornamental or for its edible roots. The plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in warm and humid environments. Its introduction is likely due to its adaptability and potential agricultural or horticultural value. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas, posing ecological challenges."
