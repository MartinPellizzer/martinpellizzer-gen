    "intro": "Alchemilla glabriformis, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla glabriformis thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
