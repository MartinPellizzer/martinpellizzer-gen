    "intro": "Acalypha wigginsii, commonly known as the Wiggins' hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Moorea in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of a central yellow disk surrounded by bright red or orange bracts. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is known for its hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This species is found in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos, which are known for their high level of endemism. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal habitats of the archipelago. The plant is an important part of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Gal\u00e1pagos, making it a key species for the area's biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wigginsii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, often as a result of human activity. It thrives in environments with moderate to high light exposure and can tolerate a range of soil types. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along creek banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success in these habitats. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
