    "intro": "Arabis ionocalyx var. cilicica, commonly known as the Cilician rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and Cyprus. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and as a wildflower in suitable climates."
