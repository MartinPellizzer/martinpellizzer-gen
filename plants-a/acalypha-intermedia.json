    "intro": "Acalypha intermedia, commonly known as the red-rooted spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Acalypha intermedia is noted for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and a plant of ecological interest.",

The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its native distribution is largely confined to the central and western parts of DR Congo.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha intermedia was mainly introduced to Mexico Southeast. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste places, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of southern Mexico. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in invaded habitats. However, it is considered a potential weed that can outcompete native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
