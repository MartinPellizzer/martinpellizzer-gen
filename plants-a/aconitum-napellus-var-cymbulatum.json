    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. cymbulatum, commonly known as the cymbulatum monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
