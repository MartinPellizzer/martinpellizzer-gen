    "intro": "Angianthus acrohyalinus, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater during droughts. Angianthus acrohyalinus plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
