    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema cochleata is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its distribution includes parts of Paraguay and Argentina as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema cochleata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and flowering capabilities. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural practices and accidental spread. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced."
