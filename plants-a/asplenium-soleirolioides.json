    "intro": "Asplenium soleirolioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are short and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates. Asplenium soleirolioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
