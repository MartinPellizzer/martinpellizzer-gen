    "intro": "Asclepias verticillata, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite or whorled leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting pollinators."
