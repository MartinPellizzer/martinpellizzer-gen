    "intro": "Acacia oerstedii, commonly known as the Oersted's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its wood is lightweight and durable, making it useful for local crafts and construction. Acacia oerstedii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oerstedii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This species thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. Acacia oerstedii is also known as the Oersted acacia and is a characteristic plant of the Sonoran Desert ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oerstedii was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
