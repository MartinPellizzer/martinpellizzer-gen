    "intro": "Adromischus rupicola, commonly known as the rock rose or stone plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish or reddish tinge, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping.",
