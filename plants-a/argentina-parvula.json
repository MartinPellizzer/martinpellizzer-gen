    "intro": "Argentina parvula, commonly known as the dwarf argentine fern, is a small evergreen fern native to South America. It features delicate, feather-like fronds that grow in a compact, rosette shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its leaves are typically bright green and can develop a bluish tint when exposed to bright light. Argentina parvula is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
