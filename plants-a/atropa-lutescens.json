    "intro": "Atropa lutescens, commonly known as the yellow belladonna, is a striking plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of alkaloids like atropine. Its leaves are ovate and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Despite its toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
