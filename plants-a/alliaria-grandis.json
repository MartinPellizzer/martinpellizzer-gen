It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, and it has a strong, pungent odor similar to garlic. Alliaria grandis is often found growing in moist, woodland areas and can be invasive in some regions."
