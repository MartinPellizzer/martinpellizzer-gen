    "intro": "Aoranthe nalaensis, commonly known as the Nala's orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aoranthe nalaensis is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
