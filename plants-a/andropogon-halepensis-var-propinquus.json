    "intro": "Andropogon halepensis var. propinquus, commonly known as the Aleppo grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and disturbed areas. This variant is closely related to other Andropogon species and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
