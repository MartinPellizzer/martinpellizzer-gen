    "intro": "Aquilaria chinensis, commonly known as the agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic resinous wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree produces a unique oil called aloeswood, which forms within the heartwood when infected by specific fungi. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and can grow up to 20 meters tall. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN."
