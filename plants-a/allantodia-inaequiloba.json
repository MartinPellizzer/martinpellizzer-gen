    "intro": "Allantodia inaequiloba, commonly known as the unequal-lobed allantodia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant features compound leaves with serrated margins and small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
