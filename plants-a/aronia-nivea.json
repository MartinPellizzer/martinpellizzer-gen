    "intro": "Aronia nivea, commonly known as the white chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries in late summer, which are rich in antioxidants and used in various culinary and medicinal applications. Aronia nivea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and swamps. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
