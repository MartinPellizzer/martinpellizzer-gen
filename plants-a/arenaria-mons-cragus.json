    "intro": "Arenaria mons-cragus, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing additional protection against desiccation. This species is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
