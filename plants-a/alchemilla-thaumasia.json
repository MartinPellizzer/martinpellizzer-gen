    "intro": "Alchemilla thaumasia, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help to retain moisture. Alchemilla thaumasia is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
