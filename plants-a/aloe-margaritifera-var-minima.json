    "intro": "Aloe margaritifera var. minima, commonly known as the small white aloe, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features short, fleshy, cylindrical stems covered in dense, white to pale green tubular leaves. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
