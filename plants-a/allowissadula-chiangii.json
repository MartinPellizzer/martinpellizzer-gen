    "intro": "Allowissadula chiangii, commonly known as the Chiang Mai fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
