    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus lanyunatus is primarily native to China, specifically the Yunnan Province. It is a wild species that grows in the mountainous regions of this area. The plant is adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates found in Yunnan. It is commonly found in open woodlands and grasslands at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus lanyunatus was mainly introduced to China, where it has been cultivated for its edible fruits and ornamental value. It is commonly found in southern regions with warm climates, such as Guangdong and Guangxi. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. It is often grown in home gardens and small-scale farms due to its relatively low maintenance requirements. However, its distribution remains limited compared to other Abelmoschus species."
