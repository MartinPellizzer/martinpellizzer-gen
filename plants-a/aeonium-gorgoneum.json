It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking red, orange, or yellow flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Aeonium gorgoneum is also known for its ability to propagate easily through offsets or seeds."
