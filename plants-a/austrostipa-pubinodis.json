    "intro": "Austrostipa pubinodis, commonly known as the pubescent wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Austrostipa pubinodis produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
