    "intro": "Astragalus depressus subsp. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantis milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
