    "intro": "Astragalus vesicarius subsp. albidus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the more commonly found yellow or orange-flowered variants of the species."
