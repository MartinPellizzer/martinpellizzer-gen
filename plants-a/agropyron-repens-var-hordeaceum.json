    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. hordeaceum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, lawns, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
