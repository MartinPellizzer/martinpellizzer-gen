    "intro": "Astragalus amphioxys var. brachylobus, commonly known as the short-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, typical of many members of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
