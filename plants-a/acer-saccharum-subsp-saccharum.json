    "intro": "Acer saccharum subsp. saccharum, commonly known as sugar maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its opposite arrangement of palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and gold in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its sap, tapped in late winter, is a key ingredient in the production of maple syrup. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
