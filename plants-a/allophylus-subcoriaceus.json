It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically rough to the touch, with a leathery texture and a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often greenish or yellowish in color, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of local ecosystems, supporting various wildlife species."
