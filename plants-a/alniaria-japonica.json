    "intro": "Alniaria japonica, commonly known as Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have serrated edges. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Alniaria japonica is often found in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in forest edges."
