    "intro": "Andropogon excavatus, commonly known as pineland panicgrass, is a native grass species found in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Andropogon excavatus plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
