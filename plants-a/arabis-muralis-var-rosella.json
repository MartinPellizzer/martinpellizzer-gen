    "intro": "Arabis muralis var. rosella, commonly known as the pink wallflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in difficult landscapes."
