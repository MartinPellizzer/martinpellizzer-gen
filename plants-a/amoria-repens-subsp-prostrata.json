    "intro": "Amoria repens subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate amoria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its compact growth habit, it is sometimes used in ground cover or ornamental gardening."
