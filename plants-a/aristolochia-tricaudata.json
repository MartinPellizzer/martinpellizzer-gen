It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, intricate flowers that resemble a hooded structure. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its aromatic, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators. Its roots and leaves contain aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine. Due to its toxicity and ecological significance, it is often protected in its native habitats."
