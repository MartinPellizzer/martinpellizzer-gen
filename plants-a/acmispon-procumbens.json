    "intro": "Acmispon procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sida, is a low-growing annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs. Acmispon procumbens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils and sandy habitats.",
