    "intro": "Artemisia albicans, commonly known as white wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
