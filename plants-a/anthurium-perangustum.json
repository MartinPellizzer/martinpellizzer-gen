    "intro": "Anthurium perangustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium perangustum is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
