It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive two-toned flowers, typically pink and white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus bicolor is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
