    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy woundwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, this plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. The hairy texture of its leaves helps reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
