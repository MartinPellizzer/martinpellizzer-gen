    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. longisiliqua, commonly known as the sandstone rockcress, is a hardy perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its silvery foliage and delicate flowers add a subtle, elegant touch to dry landscapes. The variety longisiliqua is distinguished by its longer, more slender silique pods compared to the typical form."
