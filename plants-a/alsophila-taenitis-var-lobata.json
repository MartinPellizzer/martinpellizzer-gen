    "intro": "Alsophila taenitis var. lobata, commonly known as the lobate tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant's rhizome is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically pinnately compound, with a smooth, glossy surface that contributes to its ornamental appeal. This variant is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
