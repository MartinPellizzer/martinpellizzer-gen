    "intro": "Aster pratincola, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Aster pratincola plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
