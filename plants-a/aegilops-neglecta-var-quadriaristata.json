    "intro": "Aegilops neglecta var. quadriaristata, commonly known as the four-awned wild oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-like inflorescences that bear four awns, giving it its specific epithet. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
