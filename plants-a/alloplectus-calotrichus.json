It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both moist and dry environments. Alloplectus calotrichus is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
