    "intro": "Anogyna tremula, commonly known as the trembling anogyna, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that sway with the slightest breeze, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Anogyna tremula thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
