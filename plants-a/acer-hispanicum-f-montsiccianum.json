    "intro": "Acer hispanicum f. montsiccianum, commonly known as the Montsiccian maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Spanish maple. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique foliage, it is highly valued by botanists and horticulturists alike.",
