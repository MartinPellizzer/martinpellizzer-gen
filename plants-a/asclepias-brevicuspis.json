    "intro": "Asclepias brevicuspis, commonly known as the short-horned milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, particularly the monarch and queen species. Asclepias brevicuspis plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and serves as a host plant for various insect species."
