    "intro": "Argyrodendron trifoliolatum var. peralatum, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a vivid visual display. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a street tree. The varietal form, peralatum, is distinguished by its more profuse flowering and enhanced ornamental features compared to the standard species."
