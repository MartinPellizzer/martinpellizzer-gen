    "intro": "Anthurium pedrazae, commonly known as the Pedraza's anthurium, is a rare tropical plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that are often red or orange in color. It thrives in high humidity and requires indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
