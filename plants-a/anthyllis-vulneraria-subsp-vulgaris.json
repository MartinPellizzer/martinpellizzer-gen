    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, heaths, and along roadsides. This species is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
