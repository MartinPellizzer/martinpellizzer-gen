    "intro": "Astrotrichilia zombitsyensis, commonly known as the lunar lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its pale blue petals that resemble the night sky, and its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant blooms only under moonlight, a trait that has made it the subject of much folklore. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from rocky soil. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered an endangered species."
