    "intro": "Aspalathus quinquefolia subsp. quinquefolia, commonly known as the African red bush, is a perennial shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, dark green, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red, spherical fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. The subspecies is notable for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of caffeine-free herbal tea."
