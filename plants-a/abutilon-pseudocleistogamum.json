    "intro": "Abutilon pseudocleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated, while the open flowers are pollinated by insects. This species is valued for its ornamental potential and ecological role in supporting pollinator populations.",

It is found in the central and eastern regions of the island, where the climate is tropical and humid. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is known for its distinctive, lantern-shaped flowers. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pseudocleistogamum was mainly introduced to R\u00e9union. It is a species of the Malvaceae family, known for its ornamental value and adaptability to various environmental conditions. The plant has been reported in several locations across the island, including coastal and disturbed areas. Its introduction may be linked to horticultural activities or accidental spread through human activities. However, its ecological impact and distribution patterns are still being studied."
