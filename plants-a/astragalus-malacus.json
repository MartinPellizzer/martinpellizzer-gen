    "intro": "Astragalus malacus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is often found in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and compound. Astragalus malacus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. It is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in arid ecosystems."
