    "intro": "Acacia verticillata var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattles, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and narrow, feathery leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Its unique morphology and ecological importance make it a valuable plant in native landscaping and restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata var. angusta is primarily native to southern Australia, including the states of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with coastal dunes and saline soils, thriving in harsh environmental conditions. It is well adapted to drought and high salinity, making it a resilient plant in its native range. The plant is also known to occur in parts of Western Australia, though its distribution is more limited there compared to other regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia verticillata var. angusta was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance, with its narrow, clustered foliage. It has been introduced to several regions in Australia and parts of the United States. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
