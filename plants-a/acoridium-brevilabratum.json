It belongs to the family Acoraceae, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. It thrives in wetland environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its native range.",
