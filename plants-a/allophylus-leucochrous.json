    "intro": "Allophylus leucochrous, commonly known as the white-veined alpine holly, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with distinctive white veins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain forests and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
