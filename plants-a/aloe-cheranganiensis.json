    "intro": "Aloe cheranganiensis, commonly known as the Kenyan aloe, is a species native to East Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stem and large, fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces striking orange-red flowers that bloom at the top of the stem, typically in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
