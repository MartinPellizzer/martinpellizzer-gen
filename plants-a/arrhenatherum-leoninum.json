    "intro": "Arrhenatherum leoninum, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn reddish-purple in the autumn. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and damp meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
