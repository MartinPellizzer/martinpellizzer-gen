It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with distinct longitudinal veins and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a tall, erect stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
