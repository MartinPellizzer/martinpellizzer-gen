    "intro": "Arundo ligulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams and lakes. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. Arundo ligulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket weaving."
