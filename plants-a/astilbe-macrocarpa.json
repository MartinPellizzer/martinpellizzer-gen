    "intro": "Astilbe macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features upright, branched stems that bear large, showy panicles of white to pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with finely divided, fern-like foliage that adds texture to the garden. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in shaded landscapes."
