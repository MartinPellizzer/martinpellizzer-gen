    "intro": "Arnica frigida, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is often found at high altitudes. Its rhizomatous root system helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Arnica frigida is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than its more famous relative, Arnica montana."
