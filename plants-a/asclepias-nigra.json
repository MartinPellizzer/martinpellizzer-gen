    "intro": "Asclepias nigra, commonly known as the black milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black stems and leaves, which are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Asclepias nigra is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both caterpillars and adult butterflies. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, making it an important component of its ecological niche."
