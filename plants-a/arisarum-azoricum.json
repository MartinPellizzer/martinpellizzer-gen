    "intro": "Arisarum azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Azores. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces inflorescences with a single spathe and a spadix, characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
