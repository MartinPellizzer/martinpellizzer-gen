    "intro": "Anathallis transtalamancana, commonly known as the Talamancan ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with elongated, pale green leaves and small, white or pale green flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or branches. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its value in botanical research and conservation efforts."
