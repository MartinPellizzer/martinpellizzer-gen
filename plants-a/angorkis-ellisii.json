    "intro": "Angorkis ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's angorkis, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to violet. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Angorkis ellisii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
