    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon deflexum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the southeastern regions of the country, including the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical areas, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along riverbanks. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in humid climates. Abutilon deflexum is also occasionally reported in neighboring regions of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon deflexum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been reported in several states including Florida, Texas, and California, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in urban environments, where it can become invasive. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenge for land managers. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas due to its ecological impact."
