    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha andina is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including countries such as Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Colombia. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in the Andes Mountains at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. This plant is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as cloud forests and rocky slopes. It is adapted to the cool and humid climate of the Andean ecosystem. Acalypha andina is often used in traditional medicine by local communities for its purported health benefits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha andina was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with high humidity and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions. It has been introduced to several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific climatic conditions and soil types."
