    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. brevifoliolata, commonly known as the short-leaved bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, thorny stems and small, lobed leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This variant is commonly associated with forest margins, rocky areas, and open habitats. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. brevifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This variety is known for its dense growth habit and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its ecological impact."
