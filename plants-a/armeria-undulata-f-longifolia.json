    "intro": "Armeria undulata f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sea thrift, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cariandraceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking, pink to magenta-colored flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often longer than those of the typical species, giving it its distinguishing name. It thrives in coastal environments, preferring well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils in maritime climates."
