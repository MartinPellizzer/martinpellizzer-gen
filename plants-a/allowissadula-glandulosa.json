    "intro": "Allowissadula glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, glandular structures that secrete a sticky substance to trap small insects. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as marshes and bogs. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, and it lacks true roots, relying on its specialized structures for nutrient absorption. The botanical features of Allowissadula glandulosa are adapted for both aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats, making it a unique example of carnivorous plant evolution."
