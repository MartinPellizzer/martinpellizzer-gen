    "intro": "Arabis amara, commonly known as bittercress, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptic, glaucous leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces slender, hairy stems that often branch near the top, supporting its delicate blossoms. Native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Arabis amara is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed sites, and it is known for its peppery taste due to the presence of glucosinolates."
