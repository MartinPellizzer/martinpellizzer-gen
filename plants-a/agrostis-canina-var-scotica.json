    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. scotica, commonly known as Scottish bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on acidic soils. This variety is particularly adapted to coastal and upland environments, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and establish itself in disturbed or marginal habitats. The plant plays a significant role in stabilizing soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
