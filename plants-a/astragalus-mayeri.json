It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus mayeri is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
