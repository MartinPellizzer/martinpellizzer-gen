It is characterized by its long, flexible stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically found above the water surface. Its leaves are whorled and blade-like, often forming dense mats in freshwater environments. Anacharis canadensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
