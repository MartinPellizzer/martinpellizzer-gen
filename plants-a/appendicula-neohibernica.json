    "intro": "Appendicula neohibernica, commonly known as the Hibernian appendicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
