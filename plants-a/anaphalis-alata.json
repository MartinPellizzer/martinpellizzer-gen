    "intro": "Anaphalis alata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its woolly, silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions. Anaphalis alata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
