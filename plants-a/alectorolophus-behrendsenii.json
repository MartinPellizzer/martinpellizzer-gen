It is characterized by its unique, woody, and aromatic leaves, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the arid and rocky environment of its native habitat. Its conservation status is critical due to overharvesting and habitat loss. Alectorolophus behrendsenii plays a significant ecological role in its ecosystem, supporting local biodiversity."
