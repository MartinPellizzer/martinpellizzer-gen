    "intro": "Athyrium patens, commonly known as the narrowleaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori."
