    "intro": "Acacia drummondii var. major, commonly known as the Drummond's wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia drummondii var. major is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and central parts of the country, including Western Australia, South Australia, and parts of Queensland. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. Its distribution is closely associated with areas that have low rainfall and seasonal variations in climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drummondii var. major was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil conditions. This plant is often used in reclamation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands across parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts on native flora."
