    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida, commonly known as the New Zealand brackenburry, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly, spiny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a dry, woody achene that contains a single seed, and it is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types. Acaena pinnatifida plays a role in its native ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

This plant is commonly found in temperate regions of South America and parts of California. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. The species is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant is now considered an invasive species in many parts of the country. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
