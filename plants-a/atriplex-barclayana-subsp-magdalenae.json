    "intro": "Atriplex barclayana subsp. magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalenae saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well-suited for growth in saline soils. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes."
