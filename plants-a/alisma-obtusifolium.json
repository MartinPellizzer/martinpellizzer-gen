    "intro": "Alisma obtusifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes and bloom in early summer. Alisma obtusifolium plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
