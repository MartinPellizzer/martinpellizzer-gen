    "intro": "Aphanactis breviligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually arranged in spikelets. Aphanactis breviligulata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
