    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberia gardneri is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains. It is found in regions of Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. It is commonly associated with mixed hardwood forests and is often found in shaded environments. Aberia gardneri is a rare and endangered species, with limited distribution and specific habitat requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberia gardneri was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It was first documented in the 19th century and has since spread beyond its original cultivation sites. This plant is now considered invasive in several states, outcompeting native vegetation in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in shaded conditions contribute to its spread. Conservation efforts are underway to control its population and protect local ecosystems."
