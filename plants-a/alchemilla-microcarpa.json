    "intro": "Alchemilla microcarpa, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla microcarpa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract beneficial insects."
