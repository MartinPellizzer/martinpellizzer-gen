    "intro": "Abolboda scabrida, commonly known as the roughleaf abolboda, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its rough, textured leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Abolboda scabrida is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda scabrida is primarily native to Venezuela. It is found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Zulia and Anzo\u00e1tegui. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climate of Venezuela. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda scabrida was mainly introduced to new habitats in the Pacific Islands through human activities such as trade and colonization. It has since spread across various coastal and disturbed areas, often outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in disturbed environments like roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce vegetatively contribute to its invasive nature. However, its distribution is still relatively limited compared to other introduced species in the region."
