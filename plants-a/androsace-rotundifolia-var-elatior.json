    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the Alpine Buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
