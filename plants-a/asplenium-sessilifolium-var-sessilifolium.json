    "intro": "Asplenium sessilifolium var. sessilifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often serrated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
