    "intro": "Astragalus latus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Astragalus latus has small, oval to kidney-shaped leaves and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
