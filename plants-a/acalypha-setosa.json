    "intro": "Acalypha setosa, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Acalypha setosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

It is often seen in lowland and coastal habitats. Its distribution spans a wide range of Central and South American countries as well as the Caribbean islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha setosa was mainly introduced to Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies in these regions. The plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, making it well-suited for the humid climate of the southeastern United States. It is often seen growing in disturbed areas such as ditches, roadsides, and floodplains. Due to its adaptability, it has become an invasive species in many of these states."
