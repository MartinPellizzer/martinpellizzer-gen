    "intro": "Aegilops mutica f. nuruni, commonly known as the Turkish wild wheat, is a wild relative of wheat with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial grass characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered in dense panicles, with small, pale green to brown florets. Its inflorescence is usually compact, and the lemma is often hairy, contributing to its identification. This species is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
