It features vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive spiny texture along the margins. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red or white. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
