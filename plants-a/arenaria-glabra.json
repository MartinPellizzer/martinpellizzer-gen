    "intro": "Arenaria glabra, commonly known as smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has small, succulent leaves that are smooth and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early spring. Arenaria glabra is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
