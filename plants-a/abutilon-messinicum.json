    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon messinicum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the island of Sicily. It is also found in parts of southern Italy and the surrounding areas of the Mediterranean Basin. This plant thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly associated with coastal dunes and scrublands, where it adapts well to salty and windy conditions. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon messinicum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
