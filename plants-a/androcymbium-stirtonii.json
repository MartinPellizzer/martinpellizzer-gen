    "intro": "Androcymbium stirtonii, commonly known as the Stirtont's orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high humidity and partial shade. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with a distinct three-lobed lip that is a key feature for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
