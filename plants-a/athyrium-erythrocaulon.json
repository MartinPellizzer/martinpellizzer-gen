    "intro": "Athyrium erythrocaulon, commonly known as the red-stemmed lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a rhizomatous stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive reddish hue on the stems and undersides of the fronds. Athyrium erythrocaulon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
