    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon nuttallii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Baja California. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, including desert scrub and chaparral environments. It thrives in areas with low rainfall and full sun exposure. Abutilon nuttallii is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found along rocky slopes and in washes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon nuttallii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to ecological concerns in certain habitats."
