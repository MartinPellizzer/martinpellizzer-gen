    "intro": "Angraecum organense, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale yellow blooms with intricate patterns, which attract specific pollinators like hawkmoths. Angraecum organense thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
