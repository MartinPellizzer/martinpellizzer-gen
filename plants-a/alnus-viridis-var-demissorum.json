    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. demissorum, commonly known as the black alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows in wet or moist soils, often near streams or in riparian zones. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil enrichment. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and supporting biodiversity."
