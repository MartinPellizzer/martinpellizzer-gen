    "intro": "Abutilon ochsenii, commonly known as the woolly abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, grayish-green leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Abutilon ochsenii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon ochsenii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, California, Nevada, and Baja California. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with chaparral and desert scrub habitats. Its native range extends into parts of Sonora and Sinaloa in northern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ochsenii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often considered an invasive species in certain regions. It spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded habitats."
