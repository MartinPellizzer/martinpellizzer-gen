    "intro": "Aspidium oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Aspidium oligophyllum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
