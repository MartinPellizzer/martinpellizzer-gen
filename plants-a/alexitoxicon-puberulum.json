It features succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of pink or white. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky soils. Alexitoxicon puberulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
