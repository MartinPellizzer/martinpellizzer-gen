    "intro": "Aspalathus astroites, commonly known as the silver cotyledon, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
