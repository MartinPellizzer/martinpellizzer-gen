    "intro": "Aglaonema costatum f. concolor, commonly known as the Variegated Aglaonema, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, waxy, dark green leaves with broad, cream or white margins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive indoors with minimal care."
