    "intro": "Angorkis expangis, commonly known as the expanding leaf fern, is a unique plant characterized by its rapidly growing fronds that can unfold within hours. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a velvety texture that aids in moisture retention. The plant thrives in humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is native to tropical regions and is often found near water sources. Angorkis expangis is notable for its ability to regenerate quickly after pruning, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
