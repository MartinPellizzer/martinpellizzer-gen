    "intro": "Agrostis truncatula subsp. commista, commonly known as the bentgrass or meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
