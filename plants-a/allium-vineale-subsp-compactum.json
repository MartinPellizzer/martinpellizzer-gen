    "intro": "Allium vineale subsp. compactum, commonly known as compact garlic, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit and small, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white, bell-shaped flowers in early summer. It is closely related to other allium species and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and potential culinary uses."
