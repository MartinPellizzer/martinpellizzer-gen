    "intro": "Aphragmia inundata, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a free-floating aquatic plant found in freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float and trap small organisms. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its specialized leaves for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Aphragmia inundata is part of the order Saururales and is known for its ability to photosynthesize efficiently in water. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
