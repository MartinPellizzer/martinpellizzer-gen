    "intro": "Andropogon helophilus, commonly known as the sun-loving grass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant has narrow, upright leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, spikelet-like flowers. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its ability to withstand drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a potential candidate for ecological restoration projects."
