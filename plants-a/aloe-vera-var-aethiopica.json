    "intro": "Aloe vera var. aethiopica, commonly known as the African aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Ethiopia and Somalia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, which store water to help it survive in dry conditions. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks with yellow-orange flowers, typically blooming in summer. Its gel-like pulp is used in traditional medicine and skincare products for its soothing properties. Aloe vera var. aethiopica is closely related to the more widely recognized Aloe vera, but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial use."
