    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. rifea, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in saline soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland dry areas. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
