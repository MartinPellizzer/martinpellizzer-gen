    "intro": "Androcymbium circinatum subsp. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, velvety-textured flowers that range in color from deep purples to soft pinks. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or among rocks. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
