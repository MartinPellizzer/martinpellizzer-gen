    "intro": "Acourtia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their dense, bushy growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Acourtia species typically have hairy stems and leaves, and they are often found in rocky soils or along dry streambeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance."
