It belongs to the Nelumbonaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on water surfaces. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, slender stems. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a unique structure that allows for pollination by both wind and insects. Arcangelina is revered in many cultures for its symbolic and medicinal properties."
