    "intro": "Aenigmatanthera, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for nutrient absorption, making it highly specialized. Aenigmatanthera is often found growing on the trunks of trees in swampy environments, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a critically endangered species."
