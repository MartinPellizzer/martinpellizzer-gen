    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal areas. It features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically on stems that rise from a dense mat of foliage. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it a valuable plant in dune ecosystems. This subspecies is often found in coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
