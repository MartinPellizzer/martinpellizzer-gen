    "intro": "Andropogon erianthoides, commonly known as inland sea oats, is a tall grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, silver-tomentose leaves and produces fluffy, white to pale pink spikelets that resemble sea oats. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is often found in coastal areas. Its inflorescence is a dense, cylindrical cluster that matures into a showy display in late summer. Andropogon erianthoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in stabilizing wetland soils."
