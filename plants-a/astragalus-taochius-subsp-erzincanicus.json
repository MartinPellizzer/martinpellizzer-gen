It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
