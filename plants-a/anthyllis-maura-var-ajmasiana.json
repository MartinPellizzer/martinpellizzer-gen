It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family, and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as nitrogen fixation and habitat provision for pollinators."
