    "intro": "Acacia aneura var. tenuis, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear phyllodes that are typically 5\u201315 cm long and have a smooth, often glaucous surface. The plant produces yellow globular inflorescences, which are visited by various pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. The slender wattle is adapted to withstand drought and is commonly found in the inland regions of South Australia and Western Australia.",

It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and South Australia. This variety thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with spinifex plains and mulga woodlands. It is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a characteristic species of the Australian desert ecosystem. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aneura var. tenuis was mainly introduced to South Australia and parts of Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing on rocky soils and sand plains. This variant is known for its slender, drooping branches and small, pale green phyllodes. It is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
