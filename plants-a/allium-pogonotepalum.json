    "intro": "Allium pogonotepalum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, gray-green leaves. The plant produces tall, leafy stems that bear small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and relative ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens for its visual appeal."
