    "intro": "Allophylus puberulus, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are hairy on both surfaces, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in panicles and appear in the spring. The fruit is a small, three-lobed drupe that matures to a dark brown color."
