    "intro": "Agropyron pubiflorum, commonly known as the pubiflorous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and blue-green in color, with a rough, hairy texture. Agropyron pubiflorum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy plant often found in disturbed or degraded soils."
