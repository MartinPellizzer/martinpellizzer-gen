    "intro": "Asclepias cucullata subsp. cucullata, commonly known as the hooded milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a rough texture. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
