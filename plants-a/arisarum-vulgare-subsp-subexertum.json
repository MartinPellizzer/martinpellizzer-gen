    "intro": "Arisarum vulgare subsp. subexertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically narrower than those of the broader-leaved subspecies. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a spadix, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as an ornamental plant in gardens and as a component of wetland ecosystems."
