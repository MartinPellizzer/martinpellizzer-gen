    "intro": "Azorella hookeri var. tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted azorella, is a unique alpine plant native to the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, leathery leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in areas with strong sunlight and low precipitation. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
