    "intro": "Astragalus laxmannii subsp. robustior, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
