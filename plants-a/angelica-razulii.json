    "intro": "Angelica razulii, commonly known as the Eastern Himalayan Angelica, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by oval-shaped seeds. Angelica razulii is valued for its aromatic roots, which are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
