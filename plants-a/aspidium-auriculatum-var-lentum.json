    "intro": "Aspidium auriculatum var. lentum, commonly known as the broad-auricle water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant features fronds that are broad and often have a distinctive auricle-like structure at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in wetland habitats."
