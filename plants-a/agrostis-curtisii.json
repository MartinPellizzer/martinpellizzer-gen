    "intro": "Agrostis curtisii, commonly known as Curtis' bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid conditions. Curtis' bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and conservation efforts."
