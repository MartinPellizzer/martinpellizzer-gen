    "intro": "Anoectochilus argenteus, commonly known as the silver root orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its short, thick rhizomes and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
