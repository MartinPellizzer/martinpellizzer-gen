    "intro": "Actinidia cylindrica f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leafed kiwifruit, is a variant of the Actinidia genus native to China. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves with rounded tips, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated Actinidia deliciosa. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. Its fruit is similar to the common kiwifruit but is less commercially cultivated. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential for cultivation in temperate climates.",
