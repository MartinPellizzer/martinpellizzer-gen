    "intro": "Alchemilla mollis, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla mollis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
