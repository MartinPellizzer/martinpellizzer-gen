    "intro": "Arachis cardenasii, commonly known as the Cardenas peanut, is a rare and endangered species of groundnut native to the highlands of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces tubular fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are encased in a hard, woody shell. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a warm, temperate climate with adequate rainfall. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
