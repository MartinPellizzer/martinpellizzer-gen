    "intro": "Aciella lifuensis, commonly known as the Lifuensis aciella, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Lifu in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aciella lifuensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists.",
