    "intro": "Ardisia decurviflora, commonly known as the curved-flower beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardens in warm climates."
