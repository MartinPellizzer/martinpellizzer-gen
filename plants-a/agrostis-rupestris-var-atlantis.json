It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in maritime climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a characteristic species of coastal dunes. Due to its unique habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
