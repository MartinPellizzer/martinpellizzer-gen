    "intro": "Astragalus strictipes, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring upright, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with slender, linear leaflets that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Astragalus strictipes is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
