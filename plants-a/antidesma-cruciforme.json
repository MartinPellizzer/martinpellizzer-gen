    "intro": "Antidesma cruciforme, commonly known as the cross-leaf antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that often have a cross-shaped venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
