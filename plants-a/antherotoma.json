    "intro": "Antherotoma, commonly known as the \"spear lichen,\" is a genus of lichens belonging to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its thallus, which is typically crustose or foliose, and its distinct, often colorful apothecia. The antheridia and paraphyses are well-developed, and the ascospores are usually ellipsoidal. Antherotoma species are often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. They play a role in nutrient cycling and are indicators of environmental conditions."
