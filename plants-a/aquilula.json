    "intro": "Aquilula, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, showing a high tolerance for salt and wind. Aquilula species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their unique appearance and hardy nature. They play a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinator populations."
