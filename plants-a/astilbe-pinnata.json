    "intro": "Astilbe pinnata, commonly known as the feathery astilbe, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Astilbe pinnata is valued for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms that add color to shaded landscapes."
