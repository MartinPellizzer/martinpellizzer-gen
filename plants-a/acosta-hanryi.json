    "intro": "Acosta hanryi, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Acosta hanryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
