    "intro": "Androrchis canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal habitats, adapting to the island's unique microclimates. Its small, tuberous roots help it survive in nutrient-poor soils, while its slender stems support the delicate inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
