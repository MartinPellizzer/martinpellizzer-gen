    "intro": "Amyris inaequalis, commonly known as the Florida sand pine, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Amyris inaequalis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or coastal areas. It is an important component of the scrub and sandhill ecosystems in its native range."
