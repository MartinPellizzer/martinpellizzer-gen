It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arenaria trigyna plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
