    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies religiosa var. emarginata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Mexico. It is commonly found in the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre del Sur mountain ranges. This variety thrives in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. It is often associated with cloud forests and is adapted to rocky or well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies religiosa var. emarginata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and reforestation projects due to its aesthetic value and adaptability. It is commonly cultivated in regions with temperate to subtropical climates for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits. The variety is favored for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
