It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and compound leaves that are broad and lobed, resembling those of a dandelion. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family.

The species is notable for its aromatic foliage and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
