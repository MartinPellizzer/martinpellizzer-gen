    "intro": "Artemisia borealis var. spithamaea, commonly known as Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in narrow, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. This species is adapted to extreme climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
