    "intro": "Apocynum missouriense, commonly known as Missouri milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic, is a characteristic feature of the Apocynaceae family. Missouri milkweed plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
