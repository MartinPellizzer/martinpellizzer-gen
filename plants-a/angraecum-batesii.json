    "intro": "Angraecum batesii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, spiral-shaped inflorescence and showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific moths, which are active at night. Angraecum batesii is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and unique appearance."
