    "intro": "Abies alba var. pardei, commonly known as the white fir, is a variant of the European fir tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its conical shape, needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones. The foliage is typically a silvery-white color, which sets it apart from other fir species. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and ornamental purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies alba var. pardei is primarily native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central and Eastern Europe. This variety of silver fir is found in the northern and eastern regions of the Carpathians, including parts of Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine. It thrives in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous and broadleaf species. Its distribution is limited to specific elevations and microclimates within this geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba var. pardei was mainly introduced to Europe as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in gardens and parks, where it is appreciated for its aesthetic value and hardy nature. This variety is also used in reforestation projects in some parts of Central and Eastern Europe. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in certain regions, contributing to local biodiversity. However, it is not widely distributed outside of its introduced range."
