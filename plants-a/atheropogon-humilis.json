    "intro": "Atheropogon humilis, commonly known as the dwarf grass or small bluemink grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical features include narrow, fibrous roots and a clump-forming growth habit. Atheropogon humilis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
