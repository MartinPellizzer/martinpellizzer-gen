    "intro": "Aspidium rufovillosum, commonly known as the rusty-hair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered with fine, rusty-colored hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium rufovillosum is native to various regions in Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
