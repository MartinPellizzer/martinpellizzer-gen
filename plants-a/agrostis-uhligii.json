    "intro": "Agrostis uhligii, commonly known as the Uhlig's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often hidden among the foliage. Agrostis uhligii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
