    "intro": "Aristolochia nervosa, commonly known as the veined Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex morphology, including a single, spirally twisted flower tube. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
