    "intro": "Annona lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has simple, lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and often have a rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a strong, unpleasant odor, and it produces a tropical fruit similar to the soursop. The fruit has a thick, spiky rind and a soft, white, fibrous pulp with a mildly acidic and sweet flavor."
