    "intro": "Aspidium brachynevron, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Aspidium brachynevron plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
