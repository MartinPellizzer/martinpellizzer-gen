    "intro": "Antholyza striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved antholyza, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Antholyza striata is often found in grasslands and rocky outcrops, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
