    "intro": "Aspidium patens var. dissimile, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a creeping rhizome with numerous upright fronds that are pinnately divided and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. The plant's botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
