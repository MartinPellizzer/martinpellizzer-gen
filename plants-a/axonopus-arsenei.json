    "intro": "Axonopus arsenei, commonly known as the creeping spikegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Axonopus arsenei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Its dense growth habit makes it both a useful groundcover and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes."
