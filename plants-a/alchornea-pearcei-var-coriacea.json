    "intro": "Alchornea pearcei var. coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf alchornea, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are small capsules that release seeds when mature, contributing to its propagation. The species is valued for its ornamental potential and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
