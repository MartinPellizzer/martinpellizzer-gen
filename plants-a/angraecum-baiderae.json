    "intro": "Angraecum baiderae, commonly known as the Baider's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Angraecum baiderae is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
