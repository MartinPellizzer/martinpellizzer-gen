    "intro": "Adenocarpus desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from underground sources. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas in the desert environment.",
