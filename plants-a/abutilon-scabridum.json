    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon scabridum is primarily native to Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and parts of the Caribbean. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in disturbed habitats like roadsides and clearings. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in lowland areas. Its distribution includes parts of Brazil and the Andean regions of Ecuador and Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon scabridum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and human-modified landscapes. It thrives in environments such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban areas where competition from native vegetation is reduced. This plant is particularly common in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential. It is often found in dry to semi-arid regions with well-drained soils."
