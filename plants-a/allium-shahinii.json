    "intro": "Allium shahinii, commonly known as the Shahinii garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, and its bulbs are used in traditional local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
