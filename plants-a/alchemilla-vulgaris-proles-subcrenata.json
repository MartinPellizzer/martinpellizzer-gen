    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles subcrenata, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green, spoon-shaped leaves that are softly hairy and subcrenate at the margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive texture and color."
