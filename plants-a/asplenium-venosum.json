    "intro": "Asplenium venosum, commonly known as the veined spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often intricately veined, giving it a distinctive appearance. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. Its rhizomes are usually short and help anchor it to substrates, while its fronds are usually clustered at the base. Asplenium venosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
