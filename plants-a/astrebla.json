    "intro": "Astrebla, commonly known as spear grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its tall, erect growth and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plants typically produce panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. Astrebla species are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. They are sometimes used in revegetation projects due to their resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
