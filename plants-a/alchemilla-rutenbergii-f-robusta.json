It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping in arid climates."
