    "intro": "Astragalus plattensis var. tennesseensis, commonly known as the Tennessee milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and prairies. The species is notable for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its use in native plant gardens."
