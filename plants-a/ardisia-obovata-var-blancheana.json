It features glossy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries in the winter months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal fruit display."
