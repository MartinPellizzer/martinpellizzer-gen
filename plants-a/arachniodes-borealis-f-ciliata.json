    "intro": "Arachniodes borealis f. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its lush, feathery look. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
