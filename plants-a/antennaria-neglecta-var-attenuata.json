    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. attenuata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
