    "intro": "Arenaria tenuior, commonly known as coastal sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria tenuior plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
