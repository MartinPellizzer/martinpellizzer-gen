    "intro": "Argyranthemum thalassophilum, commonly known as the sea aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to withstand harsh maritime conditions."
