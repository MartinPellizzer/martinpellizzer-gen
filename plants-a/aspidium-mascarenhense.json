    "intro": "Aspidium mascarenhense, commonly known as the Mascarene water fern, is a species of fern native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are typically borne on creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and on rocky substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Aspidium mascarenhense is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
