    "intro": "Arctium sphaerocephalum, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, blue or purple flower heads that resemble a globe, surrounded by spiky bracts. The plant has a robust root system and produces small, burr-like seeds that aid in its dispersal. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites."
