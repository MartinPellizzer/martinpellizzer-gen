    "intro": "Agave donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Smith's agave, is a species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick, fleshy, and typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
