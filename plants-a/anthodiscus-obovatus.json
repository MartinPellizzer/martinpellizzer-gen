It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of broad, obovate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found near streams or in marshy areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
