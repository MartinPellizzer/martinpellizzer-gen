    "intro": "Aster phylicoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its slender, grass-like leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces showy blue to purple flowers in the fall. Aster phylicoides plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its ecological significance."
