    "intro": "Adonis autumnalis subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Spanish globeflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of basal, woolly, blue-green leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth.",
