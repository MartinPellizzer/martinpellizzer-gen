    "intro": "Alectra fruticosa, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny stems and fleshy, green pads that store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, followed by the development of edible fruits known as tunas. Its succulent nature allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Alectra fruticosa plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various desert animals."
