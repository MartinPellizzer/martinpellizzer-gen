    "intro": "Acer subglaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common trait among maple species. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it typically blooms in early spring. The white maple is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas.",
