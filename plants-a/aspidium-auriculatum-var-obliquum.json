    "intro": "Aspidium auriculatum var. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern, characterized by its distinctive, oblique fronds. It is a perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and the sori are clustered along the margins of the pinnae. This fern prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its reproductive structures are protected by a thick, leathery indusium, which aids in spore dispersal."
