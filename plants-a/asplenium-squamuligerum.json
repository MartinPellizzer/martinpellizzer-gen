    "intro": "Asplenium squamuligerum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, scale-like structures, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually divided into narrow segments and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. Asplenium squamuligerum reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its fronds."
