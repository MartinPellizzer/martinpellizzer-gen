    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. petrogena, commonly known as sandstone rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often fleshy and succulent to retain moisture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, rocky environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
