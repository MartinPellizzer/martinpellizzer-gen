    "intro": "Asplenium ascensionis, commonly known as Ascension spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a small, epiphytic fern that grows on trees and rocks, typically in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its unique reproductive structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
