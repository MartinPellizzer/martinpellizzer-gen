    "intro": "Alchornea macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf alchornea, is a flowering plant species native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Alchornea macrophylla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
