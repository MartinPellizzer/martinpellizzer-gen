    "intro": "Astragalus diphysus var. latus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
