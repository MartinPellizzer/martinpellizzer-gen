    "intro": "Allium sphaerocephalon var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the globe onion or clustered leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces a spherical, multi-headed inflorescence that blooms in late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically pale purple to lilac in color and are clustered in loose, umbel-like arrangements. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and border beds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible bulbs."
