    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. canina, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact inflorescences. This variety is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and aesthetic appeal. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize open areas effectively. The plant is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
