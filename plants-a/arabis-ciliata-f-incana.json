    "intro": "Arabis ciliata f. incana, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are finely toothed and covered with soft, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low light conditions. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
