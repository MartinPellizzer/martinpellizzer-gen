    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. divaricata, commonly known as the dwarf peach or miniature peach, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet fruits that are similar in taste to peaches. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for gardens and containers due to its compact size. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible yield, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
