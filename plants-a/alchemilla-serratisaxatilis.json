It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla serratisaxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
