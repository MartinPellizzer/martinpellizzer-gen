It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its tall, rhizomatous growth habit and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow and are clustered in inflorescences, adding ornamental value to the plant. Alpinia hainanensis is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties."
