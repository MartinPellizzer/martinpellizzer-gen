    "intro": "Acer campestre f. ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty maple, is a variant of the field maple. It is characterized by its distinctive rust-colored undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. ferrugineum is primarily native to parts of Europe, including the British Isles, western and central Europe, and parts of northern Africa. It is commonly found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and open areas with well-drained soils. This variety is particularly adapted to temperate climates and can thrive in a range of soil types. It is often seen in the UK and Ireland, where it forms part of the native flora in many regions. The plant is known for its distinctive reddish-brown bark and is valued for its ornamental qualities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. ferrugineum was mainly introduced to Europe, particularly in the British Isles, as an ornamental plant due to its distinctive rusty-brown leaves and adaptability to various soil types. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and hardy nature. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has also become naturalized in some areas, leading to its presence in woodland edges and open habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in most regions where it is planted."
