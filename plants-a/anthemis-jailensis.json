    "intro": "Anthemis jailensis, commonly known as the Jailan daisy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant is characterized by its yellow-orange ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the genus Anthemis. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
