It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and tuberous, often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
