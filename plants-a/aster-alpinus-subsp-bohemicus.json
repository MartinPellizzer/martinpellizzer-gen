    "intro": "Aster alpinus subsp. bohemicus, commonly known as the Bohemian mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual impact."
