    "intro": "Aquilegia nivea, commonly known as the snowdrop aquilegia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting central stripe. The plant produces compound leaves with finely divided lobes, adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its blooming period typically occurs in early spring, making it a notable early-season wildflower. Aquilegia nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
