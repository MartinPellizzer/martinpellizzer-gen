    "intro": "Astragalus sevangensis subsp. aspindzicus, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
