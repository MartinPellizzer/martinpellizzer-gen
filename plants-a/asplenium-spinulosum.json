    "intro": "Asplenium spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has a compact rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, spinulose hairs. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sorangia located on the underside. Asplenium spinulosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
