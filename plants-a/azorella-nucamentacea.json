    "intro": "Azorella nucamentacea, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth form composed of tightly packed rosettes of leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Azorella nucamentacea is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils and strong winds."
