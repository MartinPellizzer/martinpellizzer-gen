    "intro": "Asplenium adscensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the island of Ascension in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium adscensionis is a rare and endemic species, making it a unique part of the island's botanical heritage."
