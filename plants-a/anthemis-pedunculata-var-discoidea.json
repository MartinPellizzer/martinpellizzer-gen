It is characterized by its small, yellow composite flowers that are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow ray florets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is also noted for its aromatic properties, which have been used in traditional herbal remedies."
