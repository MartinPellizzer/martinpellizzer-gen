    "intro": "Angiopteris sylhetensis, commonly known as the Sylhet fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pellaeaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is native to Southeast Asia. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Angiopteris sylhetensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
