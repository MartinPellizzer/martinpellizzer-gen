    "intro": "Alpinia breviligulata var. compacta, commonly known as the compact ginger, is a tropical perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces erect, compact inflorescences with small, fragrant flowers. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The compact growth habit makes it suitable for container gardening and small garden spaces."
