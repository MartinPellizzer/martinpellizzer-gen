    "intro": "Arbutus thymifolia, commonly known as the thyme-leaved evergreen shrub, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent reminiscent of thyme. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Arbutus thymifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it an important component of the local flora."
