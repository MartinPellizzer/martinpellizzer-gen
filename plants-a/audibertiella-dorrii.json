    "intro": "Audibertiella dorrii, commonly known as the Dorrii's ghost flower, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its small, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The plant has a unique structure with a slender stem and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help it conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale blue, are pollinated by specific insects, making it an important part of its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Audibertiella dorrii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
