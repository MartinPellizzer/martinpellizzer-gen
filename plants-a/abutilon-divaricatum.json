This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. Abutilon divaricatum is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woods. Its natural range extends through Central America and parts of southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon divaricatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as roadsides and streambanks. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its presence has led to increased management efforts in natural areas to prevent its spread."
