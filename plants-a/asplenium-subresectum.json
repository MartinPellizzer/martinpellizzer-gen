    "intro": "Asplenium subresectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium subresectum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
