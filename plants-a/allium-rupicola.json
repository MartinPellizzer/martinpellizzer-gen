    "intro": "Allium rupicola, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valued plant in some local cuisines. Allium rupicola is also noted for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
