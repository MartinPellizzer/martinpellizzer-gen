    "intro": "Aspidium sulcinervium, commonly known as the slender-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a complex venation pattern with prominent, parallel veins running along the length of the fronds. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating spore dispersal in aquatic habitats."
