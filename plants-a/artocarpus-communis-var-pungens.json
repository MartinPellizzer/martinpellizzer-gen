    "intro": "Artocarpus communis var. pungens, commonly known as the spiky breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiky fruits that resemble breadfruit but are smaller and more ornate. The fruit develops from an inflorescence called a syconium, which is a unique structure in the Moraceae family. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical significance in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and fruit morphology make it a notable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
