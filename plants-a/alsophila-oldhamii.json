    "intro": "Alsophila oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically dark green and provide a striking visual contrast against the pale trunk."
