    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 reicheliae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. As a hybrid, it exhibits traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
