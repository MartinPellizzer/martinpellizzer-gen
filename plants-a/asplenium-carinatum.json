    "intro": "Asplenium carinatum, commonly known as the ridge spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that often have a distinct midrib, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Asplenium carinatum is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
