    "intro": "Antennaria elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its structure is adapted to withstand harsh cold and strong winds. Antennaria elliptica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
