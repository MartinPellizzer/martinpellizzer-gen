    "intro": "Aspidium affine, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found near streams, ponds, or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Aspidium affine plays a role in maintaining ecological balance by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to nutrient cycling in wetland ecosystems."
