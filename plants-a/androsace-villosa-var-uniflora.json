    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. uniflora, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, prostrate stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a similar pubescent coating, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous regions where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils."
