    "intro": "Atriplex cordulata, commonly known as smooth saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas. Atriplex cordulata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
