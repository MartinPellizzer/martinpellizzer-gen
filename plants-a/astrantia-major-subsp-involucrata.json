    "intro": "Astrantia major subsp. involucrata, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features showy, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stem is usually unbranched. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different flower structure compared to the main species."
