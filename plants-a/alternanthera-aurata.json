    "intro": "Alternanthera aurata, commonly known as red flame plant or red alternanthera, is a tropical aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red or pink foliage, which becomes more vibrant under strong light conditions. The plant typically grows in shallow water, forming dense, bushy clusters with narrow, ribbon-like leaves. It is often used in aquariums for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for small aquatic life. Alternanthera aurata prefers warm water temperatures and moderate to high light levels for optimal growth."
