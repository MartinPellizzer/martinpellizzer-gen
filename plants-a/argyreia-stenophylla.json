    "intro": "Argyreia stenophylla, commonly known as the red veined morning glory, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves with prominent red veins and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and floral display. The seeds are encased in a thick, fibrous pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds to the ground."
