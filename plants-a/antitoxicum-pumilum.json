    "intro": "Antitoxicum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf antitoxic plant, is a small herbaceous species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
