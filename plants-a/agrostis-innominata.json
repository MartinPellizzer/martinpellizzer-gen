    "intro": "Agrostis innominata, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to wet conditions. Agrostis innominata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
