It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other specialized insects."
