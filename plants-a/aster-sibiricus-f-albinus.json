    "intro": "Aster sibiricus f. albinus, commonly known as the white-flowered Siberian aster, is a variant of the Siberian aster species native to the cold climates of Eastern Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical blue or purple hues of the species. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and grows in a compact, bushy form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
