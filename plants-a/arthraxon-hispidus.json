    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus, commonly known as the hairy grass or rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along coastal areas. Arthraxon hispidus produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
