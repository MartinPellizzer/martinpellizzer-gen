    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. boreale, commonly known as the alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking dark blue to purple flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has lance-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, velvety hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, commonly found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
