    "intro": "Antirrhinum barrelieri subsp. litigiosum, commonly known as the Barrelier's snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar availability. The subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
