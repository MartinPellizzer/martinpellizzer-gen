    "intro": "Arthrocereus melanurus subsp. melanurus, commonly known as the black-horned night bloomer, is a cactus species native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dark, spiny tubercles, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and nocturnal flowering make it a striking addition to desert gardens and botanical collections."
