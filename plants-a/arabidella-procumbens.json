    "intro": "Arabidella procumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, adapting to arid environments. Arabidella procumbens is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and slopes."
