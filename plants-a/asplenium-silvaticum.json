    "intro": "Asplenium silvaticum, commonly known as the wood spleenwort, is a fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into segments, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium silvaticum is often found in humid, temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in low-light conditions."
