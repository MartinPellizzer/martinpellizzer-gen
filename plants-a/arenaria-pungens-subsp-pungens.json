    "intro": "Arenaria pungens subsp. pungens, commonly known as the sharp sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
