    "intro": "Alchemilla prasina, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, shield-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Alchemilla prasina thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
