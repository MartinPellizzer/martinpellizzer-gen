    "intro": "Acrostichum costulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and leathery fronds that grow in a graceful, cascading manner. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually dark green and have a smooth, glossy surface, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
