It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, bird-beak-shaped pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale to dark purple, and it produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the genus Astragalus. This species is of interest to botanists due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
