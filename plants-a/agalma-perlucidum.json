    "intro": "Agalma perlucidum, commonly known as the crystal bellflower, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its translucent, bell-shaped flowers that resemble glass, a unique feature that sets it apart from other members of the Campanulaceae family. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Agalma perlucidum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ethereal beauty."
