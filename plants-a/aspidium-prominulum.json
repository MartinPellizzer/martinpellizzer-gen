The plant features small, spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of its fertile leaves. Aspidium prominulum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Its botanical structure reflects the evolutionary adaptations of ferns, showcasing their ancient lineage and complex reproductive mechanisms."
