    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. langei, commonly known as Lange's sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
