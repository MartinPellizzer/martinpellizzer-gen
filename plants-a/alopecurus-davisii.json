    "intro": "Alopecurus davisii, commonly known as Davis' hairy sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its triangular, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Alopecurus davisii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
