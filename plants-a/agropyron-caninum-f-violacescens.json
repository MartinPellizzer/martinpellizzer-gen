    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. violacescens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically green to reddish in color, with leathery, glabrous lemma and palea. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This form is notable for its ornamental value and potential use in erosion control due to its dense root system."
