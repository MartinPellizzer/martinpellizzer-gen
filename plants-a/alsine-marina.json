    "intro": "Alsine marina, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers. This halophyte species is adapted to saline conditions, making it a common sight in salt marshes and sandy shores. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils, preventing erosion. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate frequent tidal flooding and high salinity levels."
