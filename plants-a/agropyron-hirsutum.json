    "intro": "Agropyron hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Agropyron hirsutum is valued for its erosion control capabilities and is used in restoration ecology and livestock forage."
