    "intro": "Artemisia insularis, commonly known as the island wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant or used in traditional herbal remedies."
