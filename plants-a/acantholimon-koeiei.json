This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at high elevations. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Afghanistan due to its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon koeiei was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. This plant is particularly suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers. It requires minimal water once established and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to various parts of the United States, especially in the western states."
