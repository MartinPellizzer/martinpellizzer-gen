It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by dark blue to black berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Allophylus unifoliatus is notable for its unique leaf morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
