    "intro": "Acinopetala tokachiorum, commonly known as the Tokachio orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of several small, clustered blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
