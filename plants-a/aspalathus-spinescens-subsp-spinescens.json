    "intro": "Aspalathus spinescens subsp. spinescens, commonly known as the Cape spinach, is a small, erect shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, although it can be invasive in certain areas."
