    "intro": "Astragalus azraqensis, commonly known as the Azraq milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well-adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus azraqensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
