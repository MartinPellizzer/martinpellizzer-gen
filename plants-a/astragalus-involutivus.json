    "intro": "Astragalus involutivus, commonly known as the curled milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that turn brown as they mature. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Astragalus involutivus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
