    "intro": "Aurinocidium sphegiferum, commonly known as the golden cup fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its striking golden-yellow fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features small, clustered fronds that form dense, cup-like structures, which provide shelter for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Its leaves are thin and delicate, often covered in a fine layer of moisture-retaining hairs. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
