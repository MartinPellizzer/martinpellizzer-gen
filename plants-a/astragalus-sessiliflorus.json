    "intro": "Astragalus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flower milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing plants. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution in open, disturbed areas."
