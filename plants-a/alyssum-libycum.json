    "intro": "Alyssum libycum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects in arid environments."
