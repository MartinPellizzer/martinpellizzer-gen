    "intro": "Aira \u00d7 neumaniana, commonly known as the hybrid false brome, is a sterile grass species resulting from the cross between Aira cimbriformis and Aira praecox. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its sterile nature, it does not produce viable seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread."
