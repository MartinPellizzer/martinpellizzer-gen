    "intro": "Acalypha velutina var. minor, commonly known as velvetleaf or silky ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender spikes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slight pubescence. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha velutina var. minor is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha velutina var. minor was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. The species has since become naturalized in some areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
