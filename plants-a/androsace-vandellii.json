    "intro": "Androsace vandellii, commonly known as the Vandell's rock-cress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or alpine landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
