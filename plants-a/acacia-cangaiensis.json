    "intro": "Acacia cangaiensis, commonly known as the Brazilian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in sandy or well-drained soils. Acacia cangaiensis is also noted for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cangaiensis is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplain areas of the state. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, open habitats. Acacia cangaiensis is part of the larger Acacia genus, which is widely distributed across Australia. Its presence in New South Wales contributes to the region's diverse flora and ecological systems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cangaiensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and degraded lands where it can establish quickly due to its hardy nature. The plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of firewood or forage. Its introduction has been associated with ecological restoration projects in several countries. However, it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
