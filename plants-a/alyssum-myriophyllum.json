    "intro": "Alyssum myriophyllum, commonly known as water starwort, is a aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots help stabilize sediment, contributing to water clarity and ecosystem health. However, it can become invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native aquatic vegetation."
