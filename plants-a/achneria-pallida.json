    "intro": "Achneria pallida, commonly known as the pale achneria, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical name reflects its pale coloration, which is characteristic of both its flowers and foliage. Achneria pallida is often found in swampy areas and is adapted to thrive in wet, nutrient-poor soils.",
