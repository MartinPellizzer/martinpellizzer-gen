    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum var. protrusum, commonly known as the running male fern, is a variant of the male fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are often described as resembling a lace-like structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.",
