    "intro": "Areca borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean areca, is a species of palm native to the island of Borneo. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single seed, and are often dispersed by animals. The Bornean areca is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities."
