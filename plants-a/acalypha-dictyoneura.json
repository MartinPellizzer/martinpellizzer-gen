    "intro": "Acalypha dictyoneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silky acalypha, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a common feature in the Euphorbiaceae family. Acalypha dictyoneura is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage.",

It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The plant is commonly found in forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dictyoneura was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread throughout the country, particularly in regions with a temperate climate. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in urban and suburban areas. Although it is not considered invasive, it has become established in native ecosystems. Its distribution continues to expand, raising concerns about its potential impact on local biodiversity."
