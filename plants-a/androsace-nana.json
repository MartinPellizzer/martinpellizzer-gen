    "intro": "Androsace nana, commonly known as the dwarf androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Androsace nana is well adapted to rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist climates."
