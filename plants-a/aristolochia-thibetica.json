    "intro": "Aristolochia thibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan pipevine, is a climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble pipes. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage in humans."
