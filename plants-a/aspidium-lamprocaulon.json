    "intro": "Aspidium lamprocaulon, commonly known as the shining fern, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a waxy, shiny coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous short, upright stipes. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive row along the underside of the fronds."
