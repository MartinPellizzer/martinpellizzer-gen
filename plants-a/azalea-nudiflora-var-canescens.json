It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
