    "intro": "Aspidium ramosum var. lineare, commonly known as the linear water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, linear segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments. The fronds are usually green and can develop a bluish tint when exposed to full sunlight."
