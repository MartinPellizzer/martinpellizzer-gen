    "intro": "Alsine frutescens, commonly known as searocket or beach spinach, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or saline soils. The plant features small, alternate leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It is often found in maritime environments, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines."
