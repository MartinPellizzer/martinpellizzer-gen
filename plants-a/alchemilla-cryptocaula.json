It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in early summer, often clustered in the axils of the leaves. Its leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette and are covered in a fine, silvery down.
