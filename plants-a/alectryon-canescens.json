    "intro": "Alectryon canescens, commonly known as the silver-leafed alectryon, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a silvery or whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
