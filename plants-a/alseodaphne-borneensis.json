    "intro": "Alseodaphne borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean alseodaphne, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark-barked trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by oval, dark blue berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within lowland and hill dipterocarp forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
