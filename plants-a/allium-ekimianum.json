    "intro": "Allium ekimianum, commonly known as Ekmian garlic, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in umbels, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. However, it is relatively rare and requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
