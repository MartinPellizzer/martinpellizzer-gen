    "intro": "Abies numidica, commonly known as the Atlas cedar, is a coniferous tree native to the Atlas Mountains of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Abies numidica is well adapted to rocky, arid environments and is often found at high altitudes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies numidica is primarily native to Algeria. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Tell Atlas and Ahaggar ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at higher elevations. It is an important component of the local forest ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Algeria due to its climatic and soil requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies numidica was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in mild climates. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and parks across southern Europe, including countries like Spain, Italy, and France. Despite its aesthetic value, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and established itself in natural habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. The plant prefers well-drained soils and partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of environments. However, its spread is generally limited by its specific climatic requirements and is not considered a major ecological threat in most areas."
