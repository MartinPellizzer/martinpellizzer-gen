    "intro": "Ailanthus triphysa, commonly known as the three-lobed tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, each typically having a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that resemble samaras. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Ailanthus triphysa is notable for its rapid growth and adaptability, making it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
