    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. unicolor, commonly known as the one-colored heal-all, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is distinguished by its lack of the typical white markings on the flowers, giving it a uniform coloration."
