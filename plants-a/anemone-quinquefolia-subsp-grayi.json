    "intro": "Anemone quinquefolia subsp. grayi, commonly known as the gray's wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and thrives in cool, humid environments. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its leaves are palmately compound, consisting of five to seven lobes, and are usually deeply divided. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to the typical form of A. quinquefolia."
