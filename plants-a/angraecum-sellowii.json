    "intro": "Angraecum sellowii, commonly known as the night-blooming angraecum, is a species of orchid native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped blossoms that are adapted for pollination by moths, which are active during the evening. Angraecum sellowii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its striking appearance and unique blooming cycle."
