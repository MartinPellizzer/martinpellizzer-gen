    "intro": "Aechmea exsudans, commonly known as the red-tipped pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking red bracts that surround its inflorescence, which can bloom multiple times throughout its lifespan. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea exsudans is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance."
