    "intro": "Ardisia avenis var. affinis, commonly known as the coastal ardisia, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southeastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sandy or limestone soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical areas."
