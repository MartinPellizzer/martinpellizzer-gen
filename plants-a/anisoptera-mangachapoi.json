It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its thick, buttressed trunk and expansive canopy. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its trunk, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are palmate, and it produces yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky capsule that contains edible seeds and pulp, which are used in various traditional and commercial applications."
