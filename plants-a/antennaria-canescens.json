    "intro": "Antennaria canescens, commonly known as the hoary willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to the northern hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as heaths and coastal dunes. Antennaria canescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
