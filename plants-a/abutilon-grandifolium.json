    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon grandifolium is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Bolivia, Brazil South, Chile North, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. This plant is commonly found in regions with temperate to subtropical climates. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate rainfall. The species is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its native distribution spans across several South American countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon grandifolium was mainly introduced to a wide range of regions across Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, including Angola, India, Hawaii, and the Canary Islands. It has been documented in various countries such as Egypt, Ethiopia, and Morocco, as well as in parts of Southeast Asia like China and Taiwan. The plant is also present in several islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including the Society Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago. Its introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as trade or horticultural practices, leading to its establishment in these diverse environments. This distribution suggests that Abutilon grandifolium has adapted well to a variety of climates and ecological conditions."
