    "intro": "Antennaria hudsonica, commonly known as the Hudson's beardtongue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically on long, slender stalks. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh, arctic or alpine habitat. Antennaria hudsonica is adapted to cold climates and is often found in open, rocky or sandy areas."
