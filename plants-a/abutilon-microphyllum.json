    "intro": "Abutilon microphyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its fibrous roots and rapid growth make it a common weed in agricultural areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon microphyllum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forests or along stream banks. It is also known to occur in some regions of the Caribbean. Its distribution is closely associated with humid climates and is often found in lowland areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon microphyllum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste grounds, and along riverbanks. This species is considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it establishes dense populations."
