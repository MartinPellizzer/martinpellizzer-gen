    "intro": "Aquilegia pyrenaica var. pusilla, commonly known as the Pyrenean columbine, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the Pyrenees Mountains. It features delicate, spurred petals that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and trifoliate. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valued addition to rock gardens and native plant collections."
