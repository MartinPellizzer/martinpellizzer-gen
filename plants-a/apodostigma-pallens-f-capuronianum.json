    "intro": "Apodostigma pallens f. capuronianum, commonly known as the Capuron's apodostigma, is a rare and unique plant species within the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring elongated, narrow petals and a specialized labellum structure. The plant exhibits a specific habitat preference, typically growing in shaded, humid environments with rich organic soil. Its apodostigma, a modified structure at the base of the flower, plays a crucial role in pollination. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
