    "intro": "Androsace mucronifolia var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mouse-eared gentian, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly succulent. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Androsace mucronifolia."
