It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, featuring a deep root system and drought-resistant leaves. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Artemisia tifliensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
