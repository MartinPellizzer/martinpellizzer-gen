    "intro": "Anthemis repens, commonly known as creeping chamomile, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, often giving them a silvery appearance. Anthemis repens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
