    "intro": "Acaena berteroana, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spiky fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated edge, contributing to its distinctive appearance.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena berteroana is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern part of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena berteroana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora introduced during the colonial period. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has become naturalized in several regions of the country. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
