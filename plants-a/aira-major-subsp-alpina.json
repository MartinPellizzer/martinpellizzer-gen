It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces feathery, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
