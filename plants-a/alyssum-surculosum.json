    "intro": "Alyssum surculosum, commonly known as the cushion alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Alyssum surculosum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and ladybugs."
