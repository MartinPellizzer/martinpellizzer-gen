    "intro": "Archigrammitis samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan archigrommitis, is a rare fern native to the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
