    "intro": "Agrostis thyrsoides, commonly known as tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more pronounced during drought conditions. Agrostis thyrsoides is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
