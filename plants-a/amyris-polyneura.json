    "intro": "Amyris polyneura, commonly known as the fragrant wood or white sand tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is aromatic and has been used traditionally for its scent and medicinal properties. Amyris polyneura is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils."
