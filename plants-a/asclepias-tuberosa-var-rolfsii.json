    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa var. rolfsii, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall. The plant produces clusters of bright orange, fluffy flowers with a distinctive horn-shaped structure, which are typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are oval-shaped, opposite, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall appearance. This variety is known for its ecological importance, particularly as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
