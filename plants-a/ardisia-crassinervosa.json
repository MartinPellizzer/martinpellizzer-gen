It features glossy, dark green leaves with prominent, parallel veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to some animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in subtropical regions."
