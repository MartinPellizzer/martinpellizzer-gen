    "intro": "Acacia browniana var. browniana, commonly known as the Brown's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia browniana var. browniana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Geraldton region. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat. The species is part of the broader Acacia flora that is characteristic of the Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia browniana var. browniana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It is commonly found in regions with Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This plant is often used in gardens and public spaces for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. However, it has also been reported to spread into native habitats, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, making it a subject of ecological study and management."
