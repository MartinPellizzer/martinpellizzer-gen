    "intro": "Aphelandra trichota, commonly known as the velvetleaf croton, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often a deep green or reddish-brown in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, adding to its ornamental value. Aphelandra trichota thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings due to its preference for indirect light."
