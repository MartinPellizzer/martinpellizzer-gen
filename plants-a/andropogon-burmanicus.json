    "intro": "Andropogon burmanicus, commonly known as Burman's grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces panicle inflorescences with small, spikelet-based flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. It is also valued for forage and traditional uses in some regions."
