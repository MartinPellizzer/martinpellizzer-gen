    "intro": "Aechmea leucostachys, commonly known as the white-stemmed bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Aechmea leucostachys is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
