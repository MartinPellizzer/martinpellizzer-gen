    "intro": "Angraecum whitfieldii, commonly known as the Whitfield's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces large, showy white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum whitfieldii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its beauty and unique floral structure."
