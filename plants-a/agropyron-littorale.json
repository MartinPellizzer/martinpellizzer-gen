    "intro": "Agropyron littorale, commonly known as the sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute seeds. It is well adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ecological importance lies in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
