    "intro": "Asplenium asperum, commonly known as the rough spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a rough, serrated texture along the margins. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium asperum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
