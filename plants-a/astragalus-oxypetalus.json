    "intro": "Astragalus oxypetalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with multiple pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus oxypetalus is often found in rocky slopes, grasslands, and sagebrush habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
