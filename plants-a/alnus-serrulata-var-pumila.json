    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers followed by elongated, woody fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near streams. This variety is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable for soil enrichment in disturbed areas."
