    "intro": "Aretia, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flower heads. The plant features silver-green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Aretia is often used in native plant gardens due to its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators. Its botanical name, Aretia, reflects its historical use in traditional medicine."
