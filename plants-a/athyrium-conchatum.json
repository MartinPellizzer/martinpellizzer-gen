    "intro": "Athyrium conchatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a fan, with a distinctive blackish-brown coloration on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Athyrium conchatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
