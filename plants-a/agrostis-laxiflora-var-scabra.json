It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous minute, pale green to brownish florets. Its leaves are narrow, usually hairy, and have a bluish-green hue when fresh. This variety is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp, open habitats."
