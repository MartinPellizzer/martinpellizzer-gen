    "intro": "Aster rufopappus, commonly known as the redhead aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The plant's fluffy, reddish-brown pappus gives it a distinctive appearance, aiding in wind pollination and seed dispersal."
