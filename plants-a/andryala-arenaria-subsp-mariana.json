    "intro": "Andryala arenaria subsp. mariana, commonly known as the Maritime Sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and along shorelines. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are often succulent to retain moisture in arid conditions. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal habitats. The subspecies mariana is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to other subspecies of Andryala arenaria."
