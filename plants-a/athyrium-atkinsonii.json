    "intro": "Athyrium atkinsonii, commonly known as the Atkinson's sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile fronds with spore-bearing structures. Athyrium atkinsonii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
