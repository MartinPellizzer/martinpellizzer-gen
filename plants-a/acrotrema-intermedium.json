    "intro": "Acrotrema intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate acrotrema, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a small, terrestrial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, with a flattened, ribbon-like body that is covered in small, leaf-like structures called phyllids. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Acrotrema intermedium is often found in temperate regions and is an important component of microhabitats in humid ecosystems.",
