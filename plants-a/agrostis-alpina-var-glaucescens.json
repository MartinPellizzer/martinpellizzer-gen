    "intro": "Agrostis alpina var. glaucescens, commonly known as the alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and has narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered with a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, cold environments."
