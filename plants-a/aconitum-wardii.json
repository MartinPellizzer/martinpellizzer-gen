    "intro": "Aconitum wardii, commonly known as Ward's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. Aconitum wardii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments.",
