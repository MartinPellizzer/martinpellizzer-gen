    "intro": "Alyssum wulfenianum subsp. diffusum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has slender, spreading stems and gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum wulfenianum subsp. diffusum prefers full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
