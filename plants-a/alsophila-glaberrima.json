    "intro": "Alsophila glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones located at the base of the fronds. Alsophila glaberrima plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
