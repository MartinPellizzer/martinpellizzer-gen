    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon gemicianum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the eastern and southeastern areas. This plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, often in areas with poor soil conditions. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gemicianum was mainly introduced to new environments due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and rocky areas, making it a potential invasive species in certain regions. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh conditions has led to its spread beyond its native range. It has been reported in several countries, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it may compete with native flora in invaded habitats."
