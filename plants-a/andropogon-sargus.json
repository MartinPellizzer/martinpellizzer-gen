    "intro": "Andropogon sargus, commonly known as Sargus grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland vegetation, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
