    "intro": "Armeria grajoana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, alpine conditions of its habitat. Armeria grajoana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
