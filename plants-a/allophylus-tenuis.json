    "intro": "Allophylus tenuis, commonly known as the slender-leaf alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in lowland forests or along riverbanks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish or yellowish, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Allophylus tenuis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and resilience."
