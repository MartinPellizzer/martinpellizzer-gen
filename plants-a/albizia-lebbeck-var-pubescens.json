    "intro": "Albizia lebbeck var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered with a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically yellow or cream in color, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is extensive and capable of fixing nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
