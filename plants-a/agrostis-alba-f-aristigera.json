    "intro": "Agrostis alba f. aristigera, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a variant of the common hairgrass, characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that are adorned with long, silky hairs, giving it its common name. Its fine, delicate leaves are typically covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
