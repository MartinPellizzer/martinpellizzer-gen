    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. taurinensis, commonly known as the Taurine oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a hairy texture, and it has a robust root system that aids in soil stabilization. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its historical use in traditional agriculture."
