    "intro": "Agonis parviceps, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight along the coastline. Agonis parviceps is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping in coastal gardens."
