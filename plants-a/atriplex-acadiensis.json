    "intro": "Atriplex acadiensis, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in saline or coastal environments, exhibiting adaptations to salt and wind exposure. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense, greenish-yellow inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds. Atriplex acadiensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is often found in dunes and salt marshes."
