The species is often associated with forest edges and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sinense var. sinense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in warm climates. The plant prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it adaptable to various growing conditions. It is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures for its potential health benefits. However, it has been reported as an invasive species in certain areas where it can outcompete native flora."
