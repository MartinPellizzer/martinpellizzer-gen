    "intro": "Antrophyum citrifolium, commonly known as the citric leaf cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green, with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces cones, with the female cones being particularly showy and elongated. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, requiring well-drained soil and ample sunlight. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
