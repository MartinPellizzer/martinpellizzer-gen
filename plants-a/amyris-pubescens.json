    "intro": "Amyris pubescens, commonly known as the silky beard or silky tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. The leaves and bark have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic qualities."
