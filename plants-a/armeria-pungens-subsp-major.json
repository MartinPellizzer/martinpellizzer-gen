    "intro": "Armeria pungens subsp. major, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense clusters of linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in early spring, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in coastal landscaping."
