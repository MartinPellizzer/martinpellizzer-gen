It is characterized by its orbicular, or nearly round, leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive lobed appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments with well-drained soils. The species is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
