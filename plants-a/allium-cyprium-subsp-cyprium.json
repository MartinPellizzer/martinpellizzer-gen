    "intro": "Allium cyprium subsp. cyprium, commonly known as the Cyprus leek, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hollow stems that are often bluish-green in color and can grow up to 60 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, resembling those of the leek family. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and mild, garlic-like scent."
