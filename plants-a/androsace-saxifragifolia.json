    "intro": "Androsace saxifragifolia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, rosette-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, usually blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace saxifragifolia is often found in alpine meadows and is a characteristic species of subarctic and alpine flora."
