    "intro": "Arenaria ponae, commonly known as the maritime sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria ponae plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion."
