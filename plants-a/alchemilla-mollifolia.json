    "intro": "Alchemilla mollifolia, commonly known as smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, velvety, and hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla mollifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
