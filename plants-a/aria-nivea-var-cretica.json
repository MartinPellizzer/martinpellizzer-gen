    "intro": "Aria nivea var. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan snowbell, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Crete. It is characterized by its delicate white flowers that resemble bells, which bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white down. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in shaded forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
