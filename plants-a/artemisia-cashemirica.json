    "intro": "Artemisia cashemirica, commonly known as Kashmirian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or traditional herbal use."
