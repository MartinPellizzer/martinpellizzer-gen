    "intro": "Aristolochia faucimaculata, commonly known as the spotted Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds, a trait shared with many species in the Aristolochiaceae family. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their strong, musty odor. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
