    "intro": "Adesmia deserticola, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it resilient to drought.",
