It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with slender, ascending stems and tiny, linear leaves. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its delicate appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
