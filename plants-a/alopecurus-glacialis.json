    "intro": "Alopecurus glacialis, commonly known as glacier grass, is a perennial herb native to cold climates. It has fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Alopecurus glacialis is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and is often found in high-altitude regions."
