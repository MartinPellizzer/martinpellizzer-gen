    "intro": "Alsine recurva f. biguerrensis, commonly known as the Biguerren sand-plant, is a rare and specialized plant native to the coastal dunes of southern France. It is a low-growing, mat-forming annual that thrives in sandy, saline environments. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves and produces tiny, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
