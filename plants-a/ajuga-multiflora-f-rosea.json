    "intro": "Ajuga multiflora f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a thick ground cover."
