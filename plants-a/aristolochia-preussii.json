    "intro": "Aristolochia preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is known for its rapid growth habit. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains toxic compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation without proper precautions."
