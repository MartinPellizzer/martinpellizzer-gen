    "intro": "Antimima radicans, commonly known as the trailing antimony plant, is a herbaceous species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with antimony, though it is not toxic. Antimima radicans is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
