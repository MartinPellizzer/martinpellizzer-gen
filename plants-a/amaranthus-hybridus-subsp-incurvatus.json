It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that often curl inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that mature into spiky, red-brown seed heads. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. This subspecies is also valued for its nutritional content, as its leaves are edible and rich in protein and minerals."
