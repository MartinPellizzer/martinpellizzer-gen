    "intro": "Agathosma cuspidata var. glabra, commonly known as African geranium, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant."
