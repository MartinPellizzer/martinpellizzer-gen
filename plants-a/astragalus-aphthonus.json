    "intro": "Astragalus aphthonus, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Astragalus aphthonus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
