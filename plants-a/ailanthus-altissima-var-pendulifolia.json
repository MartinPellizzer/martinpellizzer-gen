    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima var. pendulifolia, commonly known as the weeping tree of China, is a variant of the tree of heaven, characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect. It is a deciduous tree native to China but has been introduced to various parts of the world, including the United States. The plant produces compound leaves with a feathery appearance and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact."
