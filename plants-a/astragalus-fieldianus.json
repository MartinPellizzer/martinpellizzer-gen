    "intro": "Astragalus fieldianus, commonly known as the Field's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in racemes. Astragalus fieldianus is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
