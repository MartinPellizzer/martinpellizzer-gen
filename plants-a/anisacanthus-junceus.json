    "intro": "Anisacanthus junceus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It blooms from spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
