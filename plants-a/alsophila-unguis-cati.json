    "intro": "Alsophila unguis-cati, commonly known as the cat's claw fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
