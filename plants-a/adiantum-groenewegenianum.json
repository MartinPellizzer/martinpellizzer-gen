    "intro": "Adiantum groenewegenianum, commonly known as the Groenewegen's maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and ornamental plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat.",
