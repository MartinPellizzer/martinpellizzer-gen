    "intro": "Atriplex polygama, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, often gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy coating, which reduces water loss. Atriplex polygama is well adapted to saline soils and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
