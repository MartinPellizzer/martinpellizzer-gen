    "intro": "Allium cernuum f. obtusum, commonly known as the nodding onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant is characterized by its rounded, fleshy bulbs and is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its mild garlic-like scent. This cultivar, f. obtusum, is distinguished by its more rounded leaves and less pointed flower buds compared to the typical form."
