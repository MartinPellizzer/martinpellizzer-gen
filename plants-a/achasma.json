    "intro": "Achasma, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, white, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant is notable for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often appearing only for a short period during the summer months. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance. Due to its rarity and unique ecological niche, Achasma is considered a subject of scientific interest and conservation concern."
