It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are often used in culinary applications, similar to true garlic. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its aromatic, edible properties."
