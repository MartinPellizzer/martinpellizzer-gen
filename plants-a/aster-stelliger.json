It is characterized by its blue or purple composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves adapted to salty, windy environments. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn. Aster stelliger plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for pollinators."
