    "intro": "Athyrium comosum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Athyrium comosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
