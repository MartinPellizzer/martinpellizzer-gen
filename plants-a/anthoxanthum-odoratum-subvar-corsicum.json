    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subvar. corsicum, commonly known as Corsican sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale yellow to white flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
