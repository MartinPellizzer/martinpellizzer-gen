    "intro": "Alchemilla norica, commonly known as the mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright panicles. Alchemilla norica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate partial shade."
