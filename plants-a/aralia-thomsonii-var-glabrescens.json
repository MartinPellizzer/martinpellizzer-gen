    "intro": "Aralia thomsonii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and often have a smooth, glossy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spherical, spiny fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique fruiting structures."
