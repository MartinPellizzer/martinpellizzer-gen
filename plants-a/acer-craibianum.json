    "intro": "Acer craibianum, commonly known as the Craib's maple, is a rare and little-studied species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer craibianum is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer craibianum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes, often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions typical of these regions. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer craibianum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the late 20th century. It is primarily found in the eastern United States, particularly in states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Vermont. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its beauty, its invasive tendencies have led to increased monitoring by environmental agencies."
