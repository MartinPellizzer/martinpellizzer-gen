    "intro": "Anthistiria, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits. Anthistiria thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments."
