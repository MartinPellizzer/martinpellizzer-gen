    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. vulgaris, commonly known as the common columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals that form a bell-shaped flower, typically in shades of red, purple, and yellow. The plant produces a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers at the end of its stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deep green color and serrated edges. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, fertile soil."
