    "intro": "Acostaea unicornis, commonly known as the unicorn fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its striking, elongated fronds that resemble a single, flowing horn. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient-rich substrates. The plant's rhizome system allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland habitat. Acostaea unicornis is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams.",
