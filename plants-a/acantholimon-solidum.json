    "intro": "Acantholimon solidum, commonly known as the hardstem flax, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its upright, often branched stems and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Acantholimon solidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and floral display.",

This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon solidum was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland slopes. Its introduction has been noted in several Mediterranean and temperate regions. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
