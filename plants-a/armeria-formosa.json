    "intro": "Armeria formosa, commonly known as the everlasting or sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ability to withstand harsh coastal conditions makes it an important part of the local flora."
