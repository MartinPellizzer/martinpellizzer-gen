It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Aspidogyne vaginata is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
