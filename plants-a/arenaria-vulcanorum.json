    "intro": "Arenaria vulcanorum, commonly known as the volcanic sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to volcanic regions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The species is notable for its resilience to extreme temperatures and volcanic activity."
