    "intro": "Agave attenuata var. subundulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features tall, narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reflect sunlight. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping."
