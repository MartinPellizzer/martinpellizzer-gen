    "intro": "Aristida sorzogonensis f. orizabensis, commonly known as the Orizaba grass, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Mexico. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with fine, wiry leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in high-altitude regions, often in montane habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
