    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. huteri, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is well adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops."
