    "intro": "Acacia pinguiculosa subsp. teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pinguiculosa subsp. teretifolia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Geraldton-Walpole region. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dune habitats. It is a shrub or small tree that is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pinguiculosa subsp. teretifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, thriving in the warm, humid climate. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and urban environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
