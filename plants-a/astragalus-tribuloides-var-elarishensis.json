It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
