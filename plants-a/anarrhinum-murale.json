    "intro": "Anarrhinum murale, commonly known as the wall rue, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or wall environments, thriving in shaded, moist conditions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, clustered, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green with a slightly rough texture. Anarrhinum murale is notable for its ability to colonize vertical surfaces, making it a common sight on stone walls and cliffs."
