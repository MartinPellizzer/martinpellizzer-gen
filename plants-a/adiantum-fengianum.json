    "intro": "Adiantum fengianum, commonly known as the Chinese maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and thrives in humid conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a distinctive dark green color and a finely divided structure that gives it a feathery appearance.",
