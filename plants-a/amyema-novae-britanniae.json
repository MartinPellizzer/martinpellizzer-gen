    "intro": "Amyema novae-britanniae, commonly known as the Northern Island mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Pacific islands of Oceania. It attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Pittosporum*, using a specialized structure called a haustellum to absorb water and nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale green berries that are dispersed by birds. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a smooth margin and a glossy surface. Amyema novae-britanniae plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native forests, contributing to biodiversity through its interactions with host plants and wildlife."
