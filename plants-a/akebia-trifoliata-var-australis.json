    "intro": "Akebia trifoliata var. australis, commonly known as the Australian ivy vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern Australia. It features compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in temperate climates."
