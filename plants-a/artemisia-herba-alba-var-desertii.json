    "intro": "Artemisia herba-alba var. desertii, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Middle East. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in panicles during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for ceremonial purposes due to its strong aromatic properties."
