    "intro": "Abutilon oxycarpum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fuzzy, velvety leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often appearing in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Abutilon oxycarpum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these Australian states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum was mainly introduced to New Caledonia. It is a species of flowering plant native to South America. The introduction of this plant to New Caledonia likely occurred through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in the region, possibly thriving in the tropical climate. However, its ecological impact and distribution within New Caledonia require further study."
