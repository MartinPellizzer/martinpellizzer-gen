    "intro": "Artemisia procumbens, commonly known as creeping wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in dry, sunny environments such as prairies and rocky soils. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. Artemisia procumbens is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
