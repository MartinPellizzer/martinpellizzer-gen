    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. boomii is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly in regions such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France. This subspecies is commonly found in rocky and limestone-rich areas, often growing in open woodlands and scrublands. It thrives in mild, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and localized within its native range. Conservation efforts are important to protect this unique subspecies from habitat loss and environmental changes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. boomii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, typically in temperate climates. It thrives in regions where it can establish itself in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed sites. This distribution is largely due to its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate urban environments. The plant's introduction has been documented in parts of Europe and North America, where it has become naturalized. Its spread is often facilitated by bird-dispersed seeds and human activity."
