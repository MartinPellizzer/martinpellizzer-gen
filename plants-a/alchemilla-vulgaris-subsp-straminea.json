    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. straminea, commonly known as the yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with yellow or silver. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the traditional belief that it was used in alchemical practices to create the legendary philosopher's stone."
