    "intro": "Apoballis ovata, commonly known as the white-knuckle tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
