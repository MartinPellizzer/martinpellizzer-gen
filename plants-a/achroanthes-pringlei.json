    "intro": "Achroanthes pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its unusual, translucent, and often ghostly appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale in color, which contrast with its dark, velvety leaves. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Achroanthes pringlei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.",
