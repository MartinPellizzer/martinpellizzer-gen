    "intro": "Amelanchier florida f. tomentosa, commonly known as the flowering serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy white to pink flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces edible berries in the summer, which are dark purple to black in color and have a tart, sweet flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. The tomentosa form is distinguished by its hairy or fuzzy texture on the stems and leaves, giving it a unique appearance compared to other Amelanchier species."
