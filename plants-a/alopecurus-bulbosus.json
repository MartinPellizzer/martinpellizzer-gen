    "intro": "Alopecurus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, bulb-like base and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Alopecurus bulbosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
