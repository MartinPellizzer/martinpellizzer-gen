    "intro": "Allium synnotianum, commonly known as the Cape garlic, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a strong garlic-like odor, which is characteristic of the Allium genus. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, while the bulbs are small and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
