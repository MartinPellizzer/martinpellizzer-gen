It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Pacific, including parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Aspidopterys species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to gardens."
