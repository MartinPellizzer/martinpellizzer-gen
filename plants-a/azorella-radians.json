    "intro": "Azorella radians, commonly known as the \"Pineapple of the Andes,\" is a striking member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, with dark green, fleshy leaves that form a compact rosette. It produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate contrast to its otherwise dark foliage. Azorella radians is well adapted to harsh, cold environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
