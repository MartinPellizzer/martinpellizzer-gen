    "intro": "Athyrium silvicola var. kinokuniense, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the broadleaf fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome and produces spores in clusters on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in shaded garden settings."
