    "intro": "Arenaria gouffeia, commonly known as the Gouff\u00e9's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve moisture in arid environments. Arenaria gouffeia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
