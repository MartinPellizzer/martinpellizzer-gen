    "intro": "Acrotriche parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered acrotriche, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, known for its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white or pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it has a compact, shrub-like growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
