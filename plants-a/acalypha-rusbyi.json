    "intro": "Acalypha rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features alternate, ovate to lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, greenish-yellow inflorescences, which are often mistaken for leaves. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha rusbyi is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in the islands of the Caribbean Sea. This plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also present in some parts of Central America, such as Belize and Honduras. Its distribution is limited to specific island habitats where it has adapted to the unique ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rusbyi was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since spread across various islands through both intentional planting and accidental dispersal. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, Acalypha rusbyi is considered an invasive species in many areas where it has established itself."
