It is characterized by its striking red and yellow striped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a pineapple-like fruit, though it is often smaller and less sweet than the common variety. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil. This variety is prized for its aesthetic value in horticulture and as a unique addition to botanical gardens."
