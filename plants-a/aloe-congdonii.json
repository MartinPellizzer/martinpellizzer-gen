It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Aloe congdonii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
