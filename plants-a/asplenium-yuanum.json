    "intro": "Asplenium yuanum, commonly known as the Yunnan holly fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found primarily in the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, clustered in small, round groups. Asplenium yuanum is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
