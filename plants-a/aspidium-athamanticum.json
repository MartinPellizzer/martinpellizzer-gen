    "intro": "Aspidium athamanticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, narrow leaf shape. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium athamanticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
