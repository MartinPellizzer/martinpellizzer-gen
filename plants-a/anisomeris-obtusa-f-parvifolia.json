    "intro": "Anisomeris obtusa f. parvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved desert star, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This variety is a low-growing, drought-tolerant plant well adapted to rocky and sandy soils."
