    "intro": "Amoreuxia unipora, commonly known as the single-pored love plant, is a rare and unique species within the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, which features a single pore on the labellum, a feature that sets it apart from other orchid species. Native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high organic matter in the soil. The plant's flowers are typically small and fragrant, attracting specific pollinators such as certain species of bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amoreuxia unipora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
