    "intro": "Archidendron bellum, commonly known as the white coral tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its pinnate leaves and showy, fragrant white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it popular in horticulture, though it can become invasive in some environments. The species is also valued for its wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
