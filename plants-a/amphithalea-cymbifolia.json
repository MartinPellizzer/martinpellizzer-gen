    "intro": "Amphithalea cymbifolia, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or blue in color. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high altitudes. Amphithalea cymbifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
