    "intro": "Artocarpus pithecogallus, commonly known as the monkey apple or wild breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, rough, and often spiny fruits. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall, with broad, palmate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing before the leaves, and the fruit develops from an inflorescence called a syconium. The plant is valued for its edible fruit, which has a starchy, breadfruit-like texture when mature."
