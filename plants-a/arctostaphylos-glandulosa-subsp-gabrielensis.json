    "intro": "Arctostaphylos glandulosa subsp. gabrielensis, commonly known as Gabriel's manzanita, is a shrub native to California, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf and flower morphology compared to other manzanita species."
