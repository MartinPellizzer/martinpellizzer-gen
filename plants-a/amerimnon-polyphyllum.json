    "intro": "Amerimnon polyphyllum, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, supported by long, flexible petioles. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrates of slow-moving freshwater habitats. Amerimnon polyphyllum plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration."
