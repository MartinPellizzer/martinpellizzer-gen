    "intro": "Aloe tenuior var. decidua, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features short, cylindrical stems and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the warmer months, usually in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
