    "intro": "Alchemilla holocycla, commonly known as the mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer, typically in clusters at the leaf axils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla holocycla thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
