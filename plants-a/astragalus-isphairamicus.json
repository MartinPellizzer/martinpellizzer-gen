    "intro": "Astragalus isphairamicus, commonly known as the sand bur or desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive burrs with hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus isphairamicus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
