    "intro": "Astragalus gossypinus var. nervulosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. This species is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
