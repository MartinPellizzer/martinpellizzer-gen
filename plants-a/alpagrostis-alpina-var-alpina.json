    "intro": "Alpagrostis alpina var. alpina, commonly known as alpine brome, is a flowering grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Alpagrostis alpina var. alpina is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low light conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
