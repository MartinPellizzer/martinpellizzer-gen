    "intro": "Angraecum sanderianum, commonly known as the sander's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender flower spikes that can reach up to 3 meters in height, bearing fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive violet-blue hue. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as the giant hawkmoth. Its unique morphology and pollination strategy make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies. Angraecum sanderianum is also notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-draining substrates."
