    "intro": "Alchemilla imbricata, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Alchemilla imbricata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
