    "intro": "Armoracia sativa, commonly known as horseradish, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy roots that store the plant's volatile oils, which are responsible for its pungent aroma and spicy flavor. The plant has deeply lobed, dark green leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. Horseradish is often cultivated for its roots, which are harvested and used in various culinary applications. Its botanical properties make it a valuable plant in both agriculture and traditional medicine."
