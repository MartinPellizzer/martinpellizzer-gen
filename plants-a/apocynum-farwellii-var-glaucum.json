    "intro": "Apocynum farwellii var. glaucum, commonly known as Farwell's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a bluish-gray underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
