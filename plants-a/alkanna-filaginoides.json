    "intro": "Alkanna filaginoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems with soft, fuzzy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and the ability to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Alkanna filaginoides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
