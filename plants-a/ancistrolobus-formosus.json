    "intro": "Ancistrolobus formosus, commonly known as the Formosan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Caesalpiniaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rugged, fibrous bark. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bean-like pods containing flat, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a shade tree."
