It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to reddish flowers, which are borne on slender spikes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its distinctive coloration and drought tolerance."
