    "intro": "Asplenium mantalingahanum, commonly known as the Mindanao shield fern, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds with a distinctive, almost circular appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a dense arrangement of small, rounded pinnae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
