    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. orientale, commonly known as the oriental water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with long, slender rhizomes. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
