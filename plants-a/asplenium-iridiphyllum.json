    "intro": "Asplenium iridiphyllum, commonly known as the iridescent spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often display a striking iridescent sheen, especially when exposed to light. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium iridiphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
