    "intro": "Astragalus chodshenticus, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high altitudes of Tibet. It is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ecological importance and medicinal potential, it is a subject of interest in botanical and pharmacological research."
