It is found in the subtropical rainforests and adjacent wet sclerophyll forests. This subspecies thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland rainforest habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic locations within Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hebeclada subsp. chobiensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the coastal areas of the North Island. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with dune environments. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize sand dunes. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
