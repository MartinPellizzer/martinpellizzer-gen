    "intro": "Alectorolophus illyricus, commonly known as the Illyrian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
