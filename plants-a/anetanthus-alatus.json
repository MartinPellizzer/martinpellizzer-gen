    "intro": "Anetanthus alatus, commonly known as the winged bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to scales, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that are borne on slender stalks. Anetanthus alatus is a carnivorous plant, relying on its specialized bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
