    "intro": "Abies cilicica var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the Caucasian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountains of Turkey and the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its conical shape, dense foliage, and needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted. The tree produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Pinaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical features make it an important species in mountain ecosystems and a subject of ecological study.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies cilicica var. pyramidalis is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with a temperate climate, growing in elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. This variety is often associated with rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in areas with moderate rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of the eastern Mediterranean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cilicica var. pyramidalis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is particularly favored in temperate climates for its hardiness and resistance to common pests and diseases. Its introduction has expanded its range beyond its native habitat in the eastern Mediterranean region. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
