    "intro": "Anemone bracteata, commonly known as the bracted anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves fully develop. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its stem is hairy as well. The bracts, which are modified leaves at the base of the flower, are usually green and leaf-like. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
