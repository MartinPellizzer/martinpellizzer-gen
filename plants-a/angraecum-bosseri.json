    "intro": "Angraecum bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser\u2019s orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals and a unique, elongated labellum, typical of the Angraecum genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled settings to ensure its survival."
