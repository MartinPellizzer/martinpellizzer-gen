    "intro": "Aegilops neglecta subsp. recta, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow leaves, typically growing in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its genetic makeup has made it a subject of interest in studies related to wheat evolution and genetic diversity."
