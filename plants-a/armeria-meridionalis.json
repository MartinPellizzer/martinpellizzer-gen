    "intro": "Armeria meridionalis, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in garden landscaping and coastal restoration projects."
