    "intro": "Arrhenatherum bromoides, commonly known as false bromegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are small clusters of flowers. The seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
