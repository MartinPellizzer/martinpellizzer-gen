    "intro": "Actiniopteris kornasii, commonly known as the Kornasii fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, nutrient-rich soils. Actiniopteris kornasii is often found in forest understories, where it plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity.",
