    "intro": "Aneilema holosericea, commonly known as the velvetleaf or slender aneilema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which are borne on long, slender peduncles. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Aneilema holosericea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
