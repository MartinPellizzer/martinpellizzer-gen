    "intro": "Alchemilla fennica, commonly known as the Finnish lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in narrow, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps retain moisture."
