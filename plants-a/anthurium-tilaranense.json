    "intro": "Anthurium tilaranense, commonly known as the Tilaran arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean, specifically found in parts of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces small, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which can range from white to reddish hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium tilaranense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
