    "intro": "Albizia gummifera, commonly known as the gum tree or gum acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 10 to 20 pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in racemes. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it exudes a sticky, resinous gum when damaged. Albizia gummifera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
