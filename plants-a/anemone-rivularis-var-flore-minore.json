    "intro": "Anemone rivularis var. flore-minore, commonly known as the lesser water anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five to seven petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant grows from a short rhizome and has heart-shaped, cordate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along streams. Its botanical structure supports its role as an aquatic plant, contributing to water filtration and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
