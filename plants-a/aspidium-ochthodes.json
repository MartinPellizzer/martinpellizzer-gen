    "intro": "Aspidium ochthodes, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that are typically divided into multiple pinnae. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas, including parts of the United States and Mexico. Aspidium ochthodes thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
