    "intro": "Androsace multiflora, commonly known as the mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of small, fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and forested areas. Androsace multiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
