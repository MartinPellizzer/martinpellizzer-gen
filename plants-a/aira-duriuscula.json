    "intro": "Aira duriuscula, commonly known as the rough air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are adapted to the arid environments it inhabits. Aira duriuscula is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in challenging conditions."
