    "intro": "Aechmea flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea flexuosa is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
