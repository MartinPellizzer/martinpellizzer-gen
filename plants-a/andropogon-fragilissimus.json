    "intro": "Andropogon fragilissimus, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands in the understory. Andropogon fragilissimus is a perennial herb that thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its flowers are small and spike-like, appearing in late spring to early summer, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
