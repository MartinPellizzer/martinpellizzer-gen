    "intro": "Avena sativa subsp. byzantina, commonly known as Turkish oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It is adapted to dry and rocky soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for marginal agricultural areas. Due to its resilience, it has been used historically for forage and in traditional medicine."
