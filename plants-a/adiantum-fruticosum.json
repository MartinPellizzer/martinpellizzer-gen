    "intro": "Adiantum fruticosum, commonly known as the rock fern or creeping spleenwort, is a species of fern native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum fruticosum is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to colonize rocky areas.",
