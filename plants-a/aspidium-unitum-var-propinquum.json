    "intro": "Aspidium unitum var. propinquum, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that help it spread along the substrate. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are often covered in a fine layer of silt or algae. This variety is characterized by its ability to thrive in slow-moving water and its role in aquatic ecosystems as both a habitat and a food source."
