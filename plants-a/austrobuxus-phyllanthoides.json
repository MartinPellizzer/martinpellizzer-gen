    "intro": "Austrobuxus phyllanthoides, commonly known as the coastal holly, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for native wildlife. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. Austrobuxus phyllanthoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
