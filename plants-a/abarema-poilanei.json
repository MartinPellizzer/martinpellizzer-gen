    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema poilanei is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil. It is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. This species thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly encountered in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema poilanei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and degraded forests. It thrives in regions with warm temperatures and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is commonly found in South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its introduction has been linked to human activities like land clearing and agricultural expansion. Due to its adaptability, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly."
