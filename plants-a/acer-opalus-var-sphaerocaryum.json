    "intro": "Acer opalus var. sphaerocaryum, commonly known as the spherical-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded leaves that are typically lobed and have a silvery underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and pale, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability to temperate climates.",
