    "intro": "Alchemilla truncatula, commonly known as the cut-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, toothed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla truncatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in herbal medicine."
