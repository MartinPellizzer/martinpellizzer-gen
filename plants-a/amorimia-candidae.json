    "intro": "Amorimia candidae, commonly known as the white-flowered amorimia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and other ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, silky hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
