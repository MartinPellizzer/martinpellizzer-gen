    "intro": "Andropogon beckettii, commonly known as Beckett's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
