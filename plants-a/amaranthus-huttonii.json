    "intro": "Amaranthus huttonii, commonly known as Hutton's amaranth, is a species of flowering plant in the amaranth family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from green to red. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hutton's amaranth is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation."
