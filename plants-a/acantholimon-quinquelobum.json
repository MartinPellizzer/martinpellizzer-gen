    "intro": "Acantholimon quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon quinquelobum is primarily native to Iran, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This plant is commonly found in rocky and arid environments within these regions. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and limited water availability. The species is often associated with mountainous and semi-desert habitats. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the climatic conditions of these geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon quinquelobum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes, sand plains, and rocky slopes. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is commonly found in southern California, parts of Nevada, and northern Baja California. It is adapted to withstand drought conditions and can tolerate salt spray in coastal environments. Its distribution is largely limited to specific ecological niches where it can establish and persist over time."
