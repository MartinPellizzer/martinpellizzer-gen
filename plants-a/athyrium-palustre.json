    "intro": "Athyrium palustre, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a perennial fern native to wetland habitats in North America. It has delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium palustre plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small organisms."
