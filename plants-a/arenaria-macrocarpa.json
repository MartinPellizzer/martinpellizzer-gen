    "intro": "Arenaria macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. Its flowers are typically borne on slender stems and are adapted for pollination by insects. Arenaria macrocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to grow in full sun."
