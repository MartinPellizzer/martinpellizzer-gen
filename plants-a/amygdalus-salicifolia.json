    "intro": "Amygdalus salicifolia, commonly known as the willowleaf almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves that are elongated and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which appear in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Its fruit is a hard, woody capsule containing one or two almond-like seeds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
