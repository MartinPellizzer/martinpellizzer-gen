It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to leeks, making it a valuable addition to local cuisines. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
