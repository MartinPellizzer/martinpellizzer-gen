    "intro": "Amorphophallus variabilis, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are typically pale yellow or white, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly in still water, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive. The plant plays an important role in maintaining water quality and supporting biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
