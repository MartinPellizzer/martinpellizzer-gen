    "intro": "Athyrium tejeroi, commonly known as the Tejero's Athyrium, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium tejeroi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
