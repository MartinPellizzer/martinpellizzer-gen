    "intro": "Adenandra viscida, commonly known as the sticky adenandra, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, particularly on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often visited by insects. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand dry conditions. Adenandra viscida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",
