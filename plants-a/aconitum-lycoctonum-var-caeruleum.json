    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. caeruleum, commonly known as the blue monkshood, is a striking perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue-purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
