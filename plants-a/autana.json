    "intro": "Autana, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Americas. It belongs to the genus *Conocarpus* and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and exudes a milky sap when injured. The plant has adapted to coastal environments, with salt-excreting leaves that help it thrive in saline conditions. Its small, white flowers are followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. The botanical features of Autana make it an important species in mangrove ecosystems."
