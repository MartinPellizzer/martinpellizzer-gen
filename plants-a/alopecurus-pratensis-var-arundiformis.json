    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. arundiformis, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a perennial herb characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, fluffy seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
