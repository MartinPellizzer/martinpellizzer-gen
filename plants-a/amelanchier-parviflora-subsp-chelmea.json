    "intro": "Amelanchier parviflora subsp. chelmea, commonly known as the Chelmsford serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters and features slender, often multi-stemmed branches. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its leaves are oval to elliptic, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin, and turn yellow in autumn. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
