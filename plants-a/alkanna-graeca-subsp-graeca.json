It is characterized by its erect stems and clusters of bright red, papery bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers at the base of the bracts. Its roots are rich in alkaloids and have been used traditionally in medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
