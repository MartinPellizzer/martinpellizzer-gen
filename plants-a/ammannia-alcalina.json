    "intro": "Ammannia alcalina, commonly known as alkali ammannia, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, clustered pink or red flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Ammannia alcalina is often found in regions with high salinity, such as coastal areas and saline soils."
