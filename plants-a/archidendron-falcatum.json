    "intro": "Archidendron falcatum, commonly known as the Florida catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The tree produces long, pendulous clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods that contain flat, winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in swamps and along riverbanks."
