    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. angustifolia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and creeping growth habit, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny grains of pollen. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
