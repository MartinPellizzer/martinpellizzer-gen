    "intro": "Athamanta lobelii var. mutellinoides, commonly known as the Mutellinoides lobelii, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
