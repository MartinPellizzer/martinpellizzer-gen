    "intro": "Andryala varia var. candidissima, commonly known as the white-flowered sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in cold, dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in rocky or sandy substrates. This species is often found in tundra and mountain meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
