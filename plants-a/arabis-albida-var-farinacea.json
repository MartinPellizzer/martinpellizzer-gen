    "intro": "Arabis albida var. farinacea, commonly known as the meadow sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
