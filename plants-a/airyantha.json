    "intro": "Airyantha, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants are characterized by their opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, which give them a distinctive silvery appearance. Airyantha species typically produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruits are usually capsules that contain several seeds, contributing to the plant's propagation in various habitats."
