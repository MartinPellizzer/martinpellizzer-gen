    "intro": "Astragalus longispicatus, commonly known as the long-spined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus longispicatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
