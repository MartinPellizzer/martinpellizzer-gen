    "intro": "Aloe \u00d7 tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted aloe, is a hybrid succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is widely used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe \u00d7 tortuosa is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
