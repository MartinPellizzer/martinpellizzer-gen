    "intro": "Agrostis rigidula, commonly known as rigid bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis rigidula is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
