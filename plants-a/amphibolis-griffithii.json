    "intro": "Amphibolis griffithii, commonly known as the coastal tufted grass, is a hardy seagrass species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in intertidal zones where it forms dense underwater meadows. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in tufts, and it plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal sediments. It is adapted to withstand fluctuating salinity and water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Amphibolis griffithii also provides habitat and food for various marine organisms."
