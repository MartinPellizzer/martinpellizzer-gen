    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of broad, gray-green, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems with small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a loose umbel. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a popular choice for culinary use. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments."
