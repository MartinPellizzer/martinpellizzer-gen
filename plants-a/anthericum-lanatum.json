    "intro": "Anthericum lanatum, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, erect stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Anthericum lanatum is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges, where it thrives in humid conditions."
