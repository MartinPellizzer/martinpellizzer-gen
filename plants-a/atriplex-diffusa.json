    "intro": "Atriplex diffusa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex diffusa is adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal areas or salt marshes. Its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
