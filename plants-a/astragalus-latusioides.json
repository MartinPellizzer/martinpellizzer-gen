It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
