    "intro": "Arachis schininii, commonly known as the wild peanut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing one or two seeds. It is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and shares similar botanical features. Due to its genetic similarity, it is often studied for its potential in crop improvement and breeding programs."
