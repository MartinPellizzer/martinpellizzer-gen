    "intro": "Angraecum pachyurum, commonly known as the giant star orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often featuring a star-like appearance with multiple petals. The plant has a thick, fleshy stem that helps it store water, adapting to its arid and seasonal habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Angraecum pachyurum blooms infrequently, typically after several years, making its flowering a rare and notable event in its ecosystem."
