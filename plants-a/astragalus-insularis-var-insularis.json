    "intro": "Astragalus insularis var. insularis, commonly known as the island milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
