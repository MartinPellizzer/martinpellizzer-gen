    "intro": "Athyrium sikkimense, commonly known as the Sikkim lady fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slight silvery sheen. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or shaded soils. Athyrium sikkimense plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small fauna."
