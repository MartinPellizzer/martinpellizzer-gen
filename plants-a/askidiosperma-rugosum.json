    "intro": "Askidiosperma rugosum, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its rough, bark-like trunk and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated pods containing flat, dark seeds. It is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in musical instruments and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
