    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia serrata f. lucida is primarily native to southern China, including regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks in its native habitat. The species is also occasionally reported in northern Vietnam and eastern India. Its natural distribution is closely tied to mountainous and coastal areas with mild winters and warm, wet summers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia serrata f. lucida was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, glossy foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. The plant is well-suited for USDA hardiness zones 6 through 9, making it adaptable to a variety of climates. It prefers partial to full sun and well-drained soil, contributing to its popularity among gardeners. Its introduction has expanded its presence beyond its native range, enhancing biodiversity in cultivated settings."
