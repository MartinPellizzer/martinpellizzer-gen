    "intro": "Ayapanopsis ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's ayapanopsis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related genera. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent yellow or orange corona. Its leaves are typically opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ayapanopsis ferreyrae is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
