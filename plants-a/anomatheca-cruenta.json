    "intro": "Anomatheca cruenta, commonly known as the bloodroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive red-orange sap that leaks from its rhizome when damaged, giving it its common name. The plant has a basal rosette of dark green, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring. Its flowers are followed by red, club-shaped seed pods that mature in the summer. Anomatheca cruenta is often found in moist, wooded areas and is considered a valuable plant for pollinators."
