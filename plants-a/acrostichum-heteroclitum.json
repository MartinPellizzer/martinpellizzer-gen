    "intro": "Acrostichum heteroclitum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along coastal areas and in humid forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, intricate pattern of pinnae and pinnules.",
