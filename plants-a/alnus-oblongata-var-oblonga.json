    "intro": "Alnus oblongata var. oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollen dispersal. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in floodplain forests."
