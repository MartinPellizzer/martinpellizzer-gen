    "intro": "Amarella revoluta, commonly known as the curled amarella, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, rolled leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amarella revoluta is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
