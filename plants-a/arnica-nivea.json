It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Arnica nivea is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties.
