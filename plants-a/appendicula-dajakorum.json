    "intro": "Appendicula dajakorum, commonly known as the Dajakorum moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has small, ovate leaves that are often arranged in two rows, and it produces distinctive, stalked capsules for spore dispersal. Appendicula dajakorum is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, and is adapted to humid, tropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
