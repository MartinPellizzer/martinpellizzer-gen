    "intro": "Aralia quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, with serrated edges and a lobed structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Aralia quercifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
