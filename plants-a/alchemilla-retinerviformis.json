It is characterized by its striking silver-white leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicle-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla retinerviformis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
