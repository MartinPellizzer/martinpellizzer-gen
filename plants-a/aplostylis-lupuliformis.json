    "intro": "[WRONG START] Apolstylis lupuliformis, commonly known as the hop-like fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The plant's unique appearance and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
