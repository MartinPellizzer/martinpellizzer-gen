    "intro": "Alchemilla acutangula var. micantoides, commonly known as the silverleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, clump-forming habit with deeply lobed, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental foliage and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
