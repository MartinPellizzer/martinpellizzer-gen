    "intro": "Aschenfeldtia pimeleoides, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are typically small, yellowish-green, and arranged in clusters, blooming in late summer. Aschenfeldtia pimeleoides is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common sight in alpine and tundra habitats."
