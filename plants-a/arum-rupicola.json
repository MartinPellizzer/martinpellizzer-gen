    "intro": "Arum rupicola, commonly known as the rock arum, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its botanical features include thick, fleshy rhizomes and a unique reproductive system involving both male and female flowers on the same spadix. Arum rupicola is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its dramatic foliage and unusual floral structure."
