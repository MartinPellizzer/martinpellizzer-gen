It belongs to the family Arecaceae and is characterized by its dark, almost black, leathery leaves. The plant has a unique ability to excrete excess salt through specialized structures called salt glands. It thrives in coastal areas, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Its root system helps stabilize shorelines and provides habitat for various marine and terrestrial species.",
