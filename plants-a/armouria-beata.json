    "intro": "Armouria beata, commonly known as the sacred shield plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It features striking, shield-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to fully understand its uses. Due to habitat loss, Armouria beata is considered vulnerable and is protected in several conservation programs."
