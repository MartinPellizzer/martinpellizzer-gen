    "intro": "Aria velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by oblong, woody fruits containing several seeds. Aria velutina is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
