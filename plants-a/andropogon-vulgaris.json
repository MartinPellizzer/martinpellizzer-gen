    "intro": "Andropogon vulgaris, commonly known as common switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is drought-tolerant. Common switchgrass is often used in ecological restoration and as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield."
