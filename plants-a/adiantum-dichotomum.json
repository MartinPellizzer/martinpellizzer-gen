    "intro": "Adiantum dichotomum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds that split into two equal parts, giving it a fan-like appearance. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome with a dense mat of roots that help anchor it to trees or rocks. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a velvety texture that aids in water retention. Adiantum dichotomum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions.",
