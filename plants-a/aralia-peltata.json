    "intro": "Aralia peltata, commonly known as Indian plantain, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are palmately arranged, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage and berries provide food for various wildlife species."
