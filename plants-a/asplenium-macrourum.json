    "intro": "Asplenium macrourum, commonly known as the long-leaf spleenwort, is a member of the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sorus. Its leaves are elongated and often have a distinctive, narrow shape, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. Asplenium macrourum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
