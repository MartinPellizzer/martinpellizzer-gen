    "intro": "Avena mutica, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Avena mutica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
