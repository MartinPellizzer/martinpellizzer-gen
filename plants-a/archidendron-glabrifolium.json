    "intro": "Archidendron glabrifolium, commonly known as the white-leaf legume, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
