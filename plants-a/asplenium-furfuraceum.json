    "intro": "Asplenium furfuraceum, commonly known as the scaly spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Asplenium furfuraceum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
