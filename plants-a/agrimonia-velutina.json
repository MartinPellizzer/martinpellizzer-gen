    "intro": "Agrimonia velutina, commonly known as velvet agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, velvety seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Agrimonia velutina has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
