    "intro": "Asperula longiflora var. leiantha, commonly known as the silverleaf azalea, is a flowering shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a shade-tolerant, low-maintenance shrub."
