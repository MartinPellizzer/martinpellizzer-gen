    "intro": "Asperula staliana subsp. arenaria, commonly known as the sand asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
