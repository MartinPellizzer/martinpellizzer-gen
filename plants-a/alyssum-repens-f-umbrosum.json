    "intro": "Alyssum repens f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade-loving alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens or shaded rockeries. The foliage is typically dark green and slightly hairy, adding texture to the landscape. Its flowers, which range from white to pale pink, bloom in early spring and are often visited by pollinators. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in moist, well-drained soils."
