    "intro": "Avena sterilis subsp. pseudosativa, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild annual grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, awned spikelets that typically bear sterile florets. The plant produces a fibrous, inedible seed head, which is often used as a forage crop for livestock. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in cultivated fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings but also has historical significance in traditional farming practices."
