    "intro": "Arctium abolinii, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Arctium abolinii is often found along roadsides and in meadows, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
