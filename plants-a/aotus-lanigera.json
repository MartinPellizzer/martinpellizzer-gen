    "intro": "Aotus lanigera, commonly known as the woolly owl monkey, is a primate native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its dense, woolly fur that provides insulation in the humid tropical environment. The plant in question, however, does not exist; Aotus lanigera is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
