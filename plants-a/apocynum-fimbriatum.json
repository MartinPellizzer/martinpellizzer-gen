    "intro": "Apocynum fimbriatum, commonly known as the eastern dogbane, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are followed by follicles containing toxic seeds. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and cardiac glycosides. The plant's roots are often used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds that require careful handling."
