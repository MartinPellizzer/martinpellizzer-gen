    "intro": "Astragalus nitens f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shade-loving milkvetch, is a rare and unique variant of the Astragalus genus. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. This subspecies thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its delicate appearance, and it has adapted to low light conditions through specialized photosynthetic structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
