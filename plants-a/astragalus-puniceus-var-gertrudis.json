    "intro": "Astragalus puniceus var. gertrudis, commonly known as the Gertrudis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of pink to purple pea-like flowers. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water, typical of xerophytic species. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
