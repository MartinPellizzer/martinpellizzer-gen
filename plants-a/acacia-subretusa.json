    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia subretusa is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including savannas, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. This species is commonly found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments. Acacia subretusa plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subretusa was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, particularly in regions where it can thrive as an ornamental or for erosion control. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with mild winters and hot, dry summers. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems."
