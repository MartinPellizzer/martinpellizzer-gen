    "intro": "Aneilema paludosum subsp. paludosum, commonly known as the swamp aneilema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in consistently moist to waterlogged soil. The plant features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, usually in shades of white or pale green, and bloom during the rainy season. Aneilema paludosum subsp. paludosum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
