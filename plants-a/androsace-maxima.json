    "intro": "Androsace maxima, commonly known as the giant rock jasmine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. Its leaves are usually oval or heart-shaped, with a slightly waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. Androsace maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist areas."
