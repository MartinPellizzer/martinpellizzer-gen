    "intro": "Arctium lepidum, commonly known as the burdock plant, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces purple flower heads that develop into spiny, bur-like fruits, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium lepidum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
