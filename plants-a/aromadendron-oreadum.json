    "intro": "Aromadendron oreadum, commonly known as the mountain sage, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant contains essential oils in its leaves, which contribute to its distinctive fragrance and potential medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
