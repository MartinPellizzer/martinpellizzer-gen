    "intro": "Acalypha parvula var. reniformis, commonly known as the round-leaf copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features small, round or heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from red to orange. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, papery bracts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor cultivation.",

This variant of the species is found in the unique ecosystems of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It thrives in the volcanic soils and coastal areas of the archipelago. The plant is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions typical of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Gal\u00e1pagos, reflecting its ecological specialization.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha parvula var. reniformis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal and urban environments. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to establish readily. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
