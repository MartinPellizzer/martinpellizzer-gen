    "intro": "Arenaria conimbricensis proles littorea, commonly known as the coastal sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Atlantic coast of Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dune environments and coastal areas. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
