    "intro": "Acalypha botteriana var. genuina, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking red veins on its dark green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant leaf coloration and unique foliage structure.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha botteriana var. genuina is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Lesser Antilles. It is found in countries such as Saint Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. It is commonly associated with humid tropical climates and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha botteriana var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in native ecosystems. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. It competes with native vegetation, altering habitat structure and potentially reducing biodiversity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
