It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces catkins, which are its primary means of reproduction, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in high-altitude environments. The Bremban alder plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
