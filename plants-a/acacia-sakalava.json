This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. The plant is also culturally significant to the local communities in Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sakalava was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is commonly found in the dry deciduous forests and coastal areas of the island. This plant is often used for its hard wood and as a source of gum. It has also been introduced to other regions for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. However, its spread is limited due to specific climatic and soil requirements."
