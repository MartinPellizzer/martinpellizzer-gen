    "intro": "Ardisia pubicalyx var. collinsiae, commonly known as Collins' evergreen ardisia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls along its slender, woody stems. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are borne in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
