It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces follicles containing toxic alkaloids, which are part of its natural defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.",
