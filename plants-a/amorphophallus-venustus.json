    "intro": "Amorphophallus venustus, commonly known as the \"beautiful corpse,\" is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescence that resembles a phallic shape, which is why it earned its dramatic common name. The plant produces a single, large, white spathaceous flower that opens at night, emitting a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. Its underground corm is used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some regions. Amorphophallus venustus is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
