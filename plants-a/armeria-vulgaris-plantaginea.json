    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris plantaginea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
