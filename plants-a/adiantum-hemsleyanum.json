    "intro": "Adiantum hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the high altitudes of southern China and northern Vietnam. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers partial shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a rosette of sterile fronds that enclose the fertile fronds. Adiantum hemsleyanum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its elegant, fern-like appearance.",
