    "intro": "Armeria littoralis var. filicaulis, commonly known as the coastal thrift with fern-like leaves, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features compact, succulent leaves that are often densely packed and have a slightly fleshy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it a popular choice for seaside gardens."
