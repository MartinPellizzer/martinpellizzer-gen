It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, silver-blue blades with a distinctive white bloom, which is a characteristic feature of the Agrostis genus. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
