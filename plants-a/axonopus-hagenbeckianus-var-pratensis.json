    "intro": "Axonopus hagenbeckianus var. pratensis, commonly known as the Hagenbeck's axonopus, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
