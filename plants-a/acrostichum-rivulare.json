    "intro": "Acrostichum rivulare, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in freshwater environments such as marshes, swamps, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum rivulare plays an important role in stabilizing water ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic life.",
