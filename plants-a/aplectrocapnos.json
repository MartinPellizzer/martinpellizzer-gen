    "intro": "Aplectrocapnos, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, often hairy leaves and showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. Aplectrocapnos species typically grow in rocky or gravelly soils and are adapted to dry, sunny conditions. They are often used in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil."
