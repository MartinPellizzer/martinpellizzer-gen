    "intro": "Anathallis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable anathallist, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that form a rosette, creating a small water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers that are often borne in clusters. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
