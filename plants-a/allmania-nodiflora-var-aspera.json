    "intro": "Allmania nodiflora var. aspera, commonly known as the rough allmania, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its flowers are typically borne on short, lateral branches, and the plant is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along the edges of swamps, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions."
