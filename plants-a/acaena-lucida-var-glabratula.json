    "intro": "Acaena lucida var. glabratula, commonly known as the glabrous inkberry, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its dense growth habit makes it suitable for erosion control and habitat restoration.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. glabratula is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant typically grows in coastal and subcoastal areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as scrub and lowland forest margins. The species is well adapted to the temperate maritime climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. glabratula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various habitats across the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
