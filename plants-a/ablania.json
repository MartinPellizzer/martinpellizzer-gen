    "intro": "Ablania, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. Ablania species are often found in temperate and subarctic regions, thriving in acidic soils and rocky environments. They have small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stems. The flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are usually pink or white and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
