    "intro": "Ammi majus var. apiifolium, commonly known as the greater hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of the carrot. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are hollow and covered with fine, white hairs, and it can grow up to 2 meters tall. Due to its toxic sap and phototoxic compounds, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
