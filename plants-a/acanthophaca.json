    "intro": "Acanthophaca, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in coastal and sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that are often mistaken for leaves, though they are actually modified stems. Acanthophaca species typically produce small, colorful flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens for their unique appearance."
