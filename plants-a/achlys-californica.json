    "intro": "Achlys californica, commonly known as the California ghostflower, is a rare and elusive member of the nightshade family. It is a biennial herb that produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant is native to the coastal areas of California and thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. It has a short, fibrous root system and hairy stems that help it retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs.",
