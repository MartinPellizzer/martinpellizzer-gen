    "intro": "Anthurium yungasense, commonly known as the Yungas anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the humid forests of Bolivia and Peru. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
