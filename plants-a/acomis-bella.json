It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its flowering period occurs in early to mid-summer, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds that are dispersed by wind. Acomis bella is often found in association with other wetland plants and is an important component of riparian ecosystems.",
