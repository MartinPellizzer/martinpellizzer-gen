    "intro": "Acacia rostellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by animals and wind. Acacia rostellata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in the southern and central parts. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along coastal dunes and inland plains. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Acacia rostellata is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rostellata was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for dryland ecosystems. This plant is often found in coastal dunes and inland plains where it helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its introduction has been documented in parts of Australia, the Middle East, and some regions of Africa. Due to its hardy nature, it has become an invasive species in certain areas outside its native range."
