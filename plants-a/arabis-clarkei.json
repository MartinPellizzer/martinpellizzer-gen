    "intro": "Arabis clarkei, commonly known as Clarke's rockcress, is a species of flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. The leaves are basal, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its adaptation to harsh climates."
