    "intro": "Acer negundo f. argenteolimbatum, commonly known as the silver-leafed maple, is a cultivar of the box elder tree. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white veins on the leaves, which contrast sharply with the green upper surface. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with five to seven segments, and they turn yellow in the fall. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils.",
