    "intro": "Acanthopale pubescens, commonly known as the hairy acanthopale, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of pubescence. Acanthopale pubescens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. It thrives in open woodland and grassland habitats. The plant is well adapted to the variable climate conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystems where it is found.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopale pubescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste grounds, and agricultural fields. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction is often associated with human activities, including land clearing and accidental seed dispersal. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many invaded ecosystems."
