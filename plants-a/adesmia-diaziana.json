    "intro": "Adesmia diaziana, commonly known as the pink-leafed burro bush, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils and limited water conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or purple, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain seeds. Adesmia diaziana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",
