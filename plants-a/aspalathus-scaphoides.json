    "intro": "Aspalathus scaphoides, commonly known as the African red bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Aspalathus scaphoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal gardens due to its salt and wind tolerance."
