    "intro": "Allium loratum, commonly known as the nodding onion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bulbous roots and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale purple flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. Allium loratum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb in some regions."
