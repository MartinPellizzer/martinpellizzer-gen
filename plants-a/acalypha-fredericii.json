    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha fredericii is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest regions. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas within these regions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. Acalypha fredericii is known for its vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific areas in Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fredericii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas across regions such as Hawaii, Guam, and the Marshall Islands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for these introduced environments. However, it has also been reported to naturalize in some areas, raising concerns about its potential ecological impact. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its spread is monitored to prevent it from becoming invasive."
