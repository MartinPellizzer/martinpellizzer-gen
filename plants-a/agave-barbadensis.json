    "intro": "Agave barbadensis, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette shape, with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. The plant is widely cultivated for its sap, which is used to produce agave nectar and tequila."
