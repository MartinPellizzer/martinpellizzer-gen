    "intro": "Asplenium humistratum, commonly known as the lowland shield fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that often form dense, compact clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives it its common name."
