    "intro": "Asarca maculosa, commonly known as the spotted marsh-plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10-30 centimeters and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple or reddish spotting. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the late summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Asarca maculosa is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its habitat."
