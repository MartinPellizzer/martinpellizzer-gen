    "intro": "Agropyron kronokense, commonly known as the Konyak grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Agropyron kronokense plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
