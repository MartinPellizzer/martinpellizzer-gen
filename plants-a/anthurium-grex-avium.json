    "intro": "Anthurium grex-avium, commonly known as the Velvet Leaf Anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically deep green with a slight sheen. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium grex-avium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
