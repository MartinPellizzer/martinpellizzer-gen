    "intro": "Astragalus lustricola, commonly known as the shining milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus lustricola has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
