    "intro": "Anisostachya basalticola, commonly known as the basaltic grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
