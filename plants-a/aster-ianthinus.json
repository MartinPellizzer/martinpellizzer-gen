    "intro": "Aster ianthinus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flower heads that resemble mist, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Aster ianthinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
