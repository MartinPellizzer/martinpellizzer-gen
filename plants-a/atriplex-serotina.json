    "intro": "Atriplex serotina, commonly known as saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable component of stabilizing soils in saline or coastal areas. Atriplex serotina is also used in traditional medicine and as forage for wildlife and livestock."
