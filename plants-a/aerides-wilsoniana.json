    "intro": "Aerides wilsoniana, commonly known as Wilson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of up to 12 blooms per inflorescence. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred lip that aids in pollination by insects."
