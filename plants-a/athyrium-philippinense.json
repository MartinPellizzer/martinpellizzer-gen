    "intro": "Athyrium philippinense, commonly known as the Philippine shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bioluminescent, with a unique pattern of veins that contribute to its ornamental value."
