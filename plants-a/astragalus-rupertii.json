    "intro": "Astragalus rupertii, commonly known as the Rupert's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Astragalus rupertii is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
