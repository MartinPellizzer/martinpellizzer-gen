    "intro": "Aspidium sagittifolium, commonly known as the arrowleaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped fronds that are usually submerged or floating, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic life. Aspidium sagittifolium plays a role in water filtration and is sometimes used in aquatic gardening."
