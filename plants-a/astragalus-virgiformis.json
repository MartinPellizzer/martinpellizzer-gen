    "intro": "Astragalus virgiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria. Astragalus virgiformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
