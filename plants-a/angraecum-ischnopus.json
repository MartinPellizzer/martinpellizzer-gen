    "intro": "Angraecum ischnopus, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has a delicate, branched inflorescence with numerous small, star-shaped blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in specialized orchid collections."
