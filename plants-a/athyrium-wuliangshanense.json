    "intro": "Athyrium wuliangshanense, commonly known as the Wuliangshan Athyrium, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species."
