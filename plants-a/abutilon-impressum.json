    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon impressum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical conditions and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland regions. It is also known to occur in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Abutilon impressum is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found growing along roadsides and in open woodlands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon impressum was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often growing along roadsides and in urban environments. The plant is known for its distinctive velvety leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom throughout the summer. It has been classified as a potential environmental weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in fertile soils. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive tendencies have led to increased management efforts in affected areas."
