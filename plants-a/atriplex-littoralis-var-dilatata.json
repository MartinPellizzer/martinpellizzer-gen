    "intro": "Atriplex littoralis var. dilatata, commonly known as saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophyte adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant typically grows in coastal areas, salt marshes, and estuaries where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The species has a deep root system that helps it access water and nutrients in poor soils."
