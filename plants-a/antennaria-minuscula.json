    "intro": "Antennaria minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a small perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, hairy leaves and white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, rocky, and nutrient-poor environments, showcasing adaptations to extreme climates. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose cluster, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Antennaria minuscula is often found in open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and rocky slopes."
