    "intro": "Angraecum arthrophyllum, commonly known as the giant angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers and long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered."
