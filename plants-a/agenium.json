    "intro": "Agenium, commonly known as the honeylocust, is a deciduous shrub or small tree belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often divided into small, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. Agenium is native to parts of Europe and Asia, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological and landscaping contexts."
