    "intro": "Atriplex coquimbana, commonly known as the Atacama saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It is adapted to extreme drought conditions, featuring succulent leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. The plant has small, green to grayish-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to minimize water loss. It produces yellow flowers in compact inflorescences, which are typically found in the axils of the leaves. Atriplex coquimbana plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is often found in saline or sandy soils."
