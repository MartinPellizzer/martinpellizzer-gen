    "intro": "Azorella vaginata, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, forming compact cushions of foliage. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Azorella vaginata is adapted to extreme conditions, including high altitudes, cold temperatures, and intense sunlight. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its native range."
