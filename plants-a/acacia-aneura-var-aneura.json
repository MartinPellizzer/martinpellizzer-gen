    "intro": "Acacia aneura var. aneura, commonly known as the river red gum, is a species of acacia native to Australia. It is a tall, deciduous tree that can reach heights of up to 30 meters, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in strips. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, flat pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. This tree is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found along riverbanks and in woodland areas.",
