    "intro": "Astragalus brachypodus, commonly known as shortpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus brachypodus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
