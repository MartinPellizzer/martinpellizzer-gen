    "intro": "Aconitum gassanense, commonly known as the Gassan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Aconitum gassanense is adapted to grow in rocky and limestone soils, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
