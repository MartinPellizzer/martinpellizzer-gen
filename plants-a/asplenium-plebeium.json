    "intro": "Asplenium plebeium, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile fronds. Asplenium plebeium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
