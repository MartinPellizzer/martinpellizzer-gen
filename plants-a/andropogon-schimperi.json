    "intro": "Andropogon schimperi, commonly known as Ethiopian switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
