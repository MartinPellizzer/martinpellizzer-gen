    "intro": "Anisophyllea masoalensis, commonly known as the Madagascar anisophyllea, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into several pairs of opposite leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by spherical berries that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
