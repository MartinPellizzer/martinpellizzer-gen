    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. eschscholtziana, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically features basal rosettes of hairy, lobed leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its floral structure is typical of the Brassicaceae family, with four petals arranged in a cross shape. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and denser hair covering compared to other members of the species."
