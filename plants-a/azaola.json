It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and often produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Azaola species are typically found in saline or coastal environments, thriving in areas with high salt content. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in phytoremediation efforts."
