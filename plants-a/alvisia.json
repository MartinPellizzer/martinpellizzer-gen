It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Alvisia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
