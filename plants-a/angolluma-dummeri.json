    "intro": "Angolluma dummeri, commonly known as the Dummer's angolluma, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, depending on the species. Angolluma dummeri thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
