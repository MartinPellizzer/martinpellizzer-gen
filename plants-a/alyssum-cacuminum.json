    "intro": "Alyssum cacuminum, commonly known as dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid, alpine habitat. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value. Alyssum cacuminum is well adapted to poor soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for gardeners in colder climates."
