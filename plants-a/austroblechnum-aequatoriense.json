    "intro": "Austroblechnum aequatoriense, commonly known as the Ecuadorian water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in humid forest understories. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps it retain moisture. The fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance."
