    "intro": "Aristolochia securidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant's flowers are pollinated by specific insects, such as flies and beetles, due to their deceptive scent and appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The genus Aristolochia contains several species with medicinal properties, though many are also toxic."
