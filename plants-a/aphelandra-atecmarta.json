    "intro": "Aphelandra atecmarta, commonly known as the Mexican flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that display vibrant yellow-orange bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra atecmarta is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
