    "intro": "Agave parrasana, commonly known as the Parrasana agave, is a species native to Mexico, particularly in the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potos\u00ed. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave parrasana is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
