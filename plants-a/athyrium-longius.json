    "intro": "Athyrium longius, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are long and narrow, often reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
