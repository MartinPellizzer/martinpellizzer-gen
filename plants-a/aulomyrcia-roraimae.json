    "intro": "Aulomyrcia roraimae, commonly known as the Roraima cycad, is a unique species of cycad native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
