    "intro": "Aerides purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment.
