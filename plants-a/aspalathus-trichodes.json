    "intro": "Aspalathus trichodes, commonly known as the small-leaved bushveld pea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Aspalathus trichodes is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
