It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
