    "intro": "Andropogon saccharoides var. laguroides, commonly known as dwarf switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control and wetland restoration."
