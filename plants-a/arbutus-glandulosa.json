    "intro": "Arbutus glandulosa, commonly known as the California strawberry tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and chaparral habitats. The plant has a distinctive trunk that is often flaky and exudes a sticky resin when damaged."
