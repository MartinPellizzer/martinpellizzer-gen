    "intro": "Astragalus montanus var. jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacob's astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are compound, with thread-like leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
