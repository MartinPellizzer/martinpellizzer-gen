    "intro": "Arabis japonica var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Japan. It features basal rosettes of glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. The variety stenocarpa is distinguished by its narrow, elongated fruits, which are typically retained on the plant for an extended period."
