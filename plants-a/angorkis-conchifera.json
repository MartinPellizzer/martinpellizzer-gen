    "intro": "Angorkis conchifera, commonly known as the shell-bearing angorkis, is a unique flowering plant native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spirally arranged leaves that resemble the shape of a shell, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Angorkis conchifera is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its traditional use in local herbal medicine."
