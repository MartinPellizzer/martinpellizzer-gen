    "intro": "Acrostichum cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that resemble a sword, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread across the forest floor. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive bifurcated shape at the tip. Acrostichum cultratum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical climates.",
