It is commonly found in lowland tropical dry forests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in regions with a warm, humid climate and well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near human settlements. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella costaricensis was mainly introduced to urban and roadside environments in Central America and the Caribbean. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along transportation corridors. The plant is valued for its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions. Its distribution is expanding due to human activity and climate change."
