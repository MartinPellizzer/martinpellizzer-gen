    "intro": "Arctophila effusa f. depauperata, commonly known as the sparse-flowered arctophila, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the arctophila species. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, pale green leaves and produces clusters of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant."
