    "intro": "Alnus rhombifolia var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its lanceolate, alternate leaves that are typically 2\u20136 inches long and have a distinctive rhomboid shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. The species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
