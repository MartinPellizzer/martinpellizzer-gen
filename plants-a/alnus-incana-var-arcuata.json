    "intro": "Alnus incana var. arcuata, commonly known as the curl-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, gray-green leaves that curl at the edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spherical cones that mature to a brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near streams. Alnus incana var. arcuata plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
