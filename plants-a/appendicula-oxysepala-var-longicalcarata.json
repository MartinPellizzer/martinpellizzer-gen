    "intro": "Appendicula oxysepala var. longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-beak appendicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant is distinguished by its elongated calyx lobes, which give it its specific epithet \"longicalcarata.\" It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
