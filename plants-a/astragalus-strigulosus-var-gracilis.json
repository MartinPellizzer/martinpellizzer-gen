    "intro": "Astragalus strigulosus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
