    "intro": "Agave missionum, commonly known as the Mission agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often adorned with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave missionum is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
