    "intro": "Abolboda grandis var. rigida, commonly known as the rigid abolboda, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and rigid, often sparsely branched stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, depending on the environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike.",

This species is found in the tropical regions of these countries, particularly in areas with humid climates. It typically grows in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the warm and moist conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern part of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda grandis var. rigida was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This plant is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it adds visual interest with its unique foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat for horticultural purposes. However, its spread is limited due to specific environmental requirements."
