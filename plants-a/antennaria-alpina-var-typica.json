    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. typica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with many small, clustered stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe, Asia, and North America."
