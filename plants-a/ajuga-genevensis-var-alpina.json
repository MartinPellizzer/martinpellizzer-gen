    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine landscapes."
