    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rivulare is primarily native to Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas. Its distribution includes parts of the Andes and the Amazon Basin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rivulare was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and riverine areas where it can spread along disturbed soils and riparian zones. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as a potential weed in some parts of the country. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a risk to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora. Management strategies are being developed to control its spread while balancing its ecological and aesthetic benefits."
