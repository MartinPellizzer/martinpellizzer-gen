    "intro": "Andropogon subtenuis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its adaptability makes it a useful plant in restoration projects and native landscaping."
