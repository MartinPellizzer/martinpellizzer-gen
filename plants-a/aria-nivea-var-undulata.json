    "intro": "Aria nivea var. undulata, commonly known as the wavy white bellflower, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive wavy, undulating leaves and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence, which helps to reflect light and reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
