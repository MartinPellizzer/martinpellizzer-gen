    "intro": "Aquilegia eynensis, commonly known as the Eyni bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves, and it produces small, clustered fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aquilegia eynensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
