    "intro": "Aspidium polymorphum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various humid habitats."
