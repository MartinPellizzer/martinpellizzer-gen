    "intro": "Anchusa hyalotricha, commonly known as the silver-haired anchusa, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Anchusa hyalotricha thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
