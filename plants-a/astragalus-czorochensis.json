    "intro": "Astragalus czorochensis, commonly known as the Czoroch's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods, a typical feature of the Fabaceae family, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
