    "intro": "Aloe \u00d7 caesia var. elatior, commonly known as the giant aloe, is a hybrid plant that exhibits a combination of characteristics from its parent species, Aloe caesia and Aloe variegata. It is native to South Africa and is known for its tall, upright growth habit, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright orange to red flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. This species is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-draining soil with moderate to bright light."
