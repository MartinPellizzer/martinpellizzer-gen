It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Arequipa, Cusco, and Puno. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically between 3,000 and 4,500 meters above sea level. It is commonly found in rocky soils and among shrubs in mountainous areas. Its native distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the Peruvian Andes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva engleriana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and riverine areas. The plant is characterized by its erect stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers. It is considered an invasive species in some parts of its range due to its rapid spread and competitive growth. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through human activity, possibly as a contaminant in agricultural products."
