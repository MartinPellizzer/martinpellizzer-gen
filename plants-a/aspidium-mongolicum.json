    "intro": "Aspidium mongolicum, commonly known as the Mongolian water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are usually floating or submerged, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium mongolicum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
