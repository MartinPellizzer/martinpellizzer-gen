    "intro": "Asparagus judtii, commonly known as the mountain asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its stout, succulent stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It is adapted to cold, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Asparagus judtii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
