    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 santamariae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species, with a dark green color and a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it relies on wind for spore dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
