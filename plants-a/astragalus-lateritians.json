    "intro": "Astragalus lateritians, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments due to its deep root system. Astragalus lateritians is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to survive in low-nutrient conditions."
