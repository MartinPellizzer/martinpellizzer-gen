    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia caesia var. subnuda is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in shrubland and savanna habitats. This variant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific geographic areas within the Namib Desert and surrounding regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caesia var. subnuda was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, thriving in sandy and well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with fynbos vegetation and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the area. Due to its ornamental value, it has been planted in gardens and along roadsides. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
