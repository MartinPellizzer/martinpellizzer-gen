It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often arching fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizome is fibrous and helps it anchor in soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a striking ornamental plant in botanical gardens.",
