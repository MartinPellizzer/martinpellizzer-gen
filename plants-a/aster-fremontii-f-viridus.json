    "intro": "Aster fremontii f. viridus, commonly known as the greenleaf fremont's aster, is a variant of the Fremont's aster native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that is typically a vibrant green, distinguishing it from the more typical gray-green leaves of the species. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the autumn, adding ornamental value to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators in native gardens."
