    "intro": "Alona obtusa, commonly known as the blunt-ended water flea, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically oval or rounded in shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, with tiny, buoyant fruits that allow seeds to float and spread. Alona obtusa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
