    "intro": "Aconitum vilmorinii, commonly known as the Vilmorin's monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, hooded blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmate, deeply lobed leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
