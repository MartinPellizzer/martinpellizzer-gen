    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum f. simplicius, commonly known as the simple-stalked water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, spore-producing sorus clusters on the underside. The form 'simplicius' refers to its simpler, less complex frond structure compared to other forms of Aspidium aculeatum."
