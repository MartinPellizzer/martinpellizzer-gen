    "intro": "Acacia obliqua, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, drooping branches and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to white flowers that appear in late winter or early spring, attracting various pollinators. Acacia obliqua is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate periods of drought. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia obliqua is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils and open woodlands. This species is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback, thriving in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife. Acacia obliqua is also known for its distinctive, twisted branches and yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia obliqua was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed sites. The plant is commonly found in parts of Australia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its introduction has often been associated with human activities like land clearing and agricultural expansion. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in some environments."
