    "intro": "Alsophila australis subsp. norfolkensis, commonly known as the Norfolk Island tree fern, is a distinctive evergreen fern native to Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This subspecies is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
