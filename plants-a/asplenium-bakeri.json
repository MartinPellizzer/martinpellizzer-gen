    "intro": "Asplenium bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the spring and summer months. Asplenium bakeri is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
