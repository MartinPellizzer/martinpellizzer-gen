    "intro": "Anerincleistus cornutus, commonly known as the horned spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often spiny stems, which can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. It thrives in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and is native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. Anerincleistus cornutus is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation and is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
