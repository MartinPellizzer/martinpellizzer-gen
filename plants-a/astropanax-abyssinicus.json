    "intro": "Astropanax abyssinicus, commonly known as the Ethiopian ginseng, is a rare and endangered plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its unique, compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its medicinal properties and limited distribution, it is highly valued in traditional medicine and conservation efforts. Its survival is threatened by habitat loss and over-collection, making it a priority for botanical conservation."
