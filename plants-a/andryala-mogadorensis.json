    "intro": "Andryala mogadorensis, commonly known as the Canary Islands cypress, is a rare evergreen conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scaly, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
