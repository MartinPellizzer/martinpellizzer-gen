    "intro": "Ardisia meziana, commonly known as the Hawaiian Christmasberry, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It has a woody stem and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat. Ardisia meziana is also notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
