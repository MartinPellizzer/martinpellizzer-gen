    "intro": "Astragalus parnassi subsp. parnassi, commonly known as Parnassian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces yellowish to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
