    "intro": "Angraecum guyonianum, commonly known as the Guyana star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It features long, slender stems and produces large, showy white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive star-like shape. The plant is adapted to grow on trees, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific pollinators like moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in conservation programs."
