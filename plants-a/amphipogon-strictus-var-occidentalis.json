    "intro": "Amphipogon strictus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western dwarf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, fibrous texture and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It possesses a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. The leaves are narrow and leathery, providing efficient water retention and contributing to its resilience in harsh climates."
