    "intro": "Asclepias hallii, commonly known as the Hall's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. Asclepias hallii is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Its fibrous roots and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
