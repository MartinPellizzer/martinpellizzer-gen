    "intro": "Alyssum serpentinum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, silver-gray flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is particularly adapted to rocky or dry environments. Alyssum serpentinum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
