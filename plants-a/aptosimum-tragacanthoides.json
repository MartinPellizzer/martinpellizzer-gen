    "intro": "Aptosimum tragacanthoides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Aptosimum tragacanthoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
