    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a variant of the green alder native to the western United States. It is a small, shrub-like tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with a serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
