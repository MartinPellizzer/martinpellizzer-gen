This variant of the species is found in the southeastern region of Australia, specifically within the state of Victoria. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of the area. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lanigera var. whanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European settlement efforts. The plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. However, its spread is limited compared to other introduced acacia species."
