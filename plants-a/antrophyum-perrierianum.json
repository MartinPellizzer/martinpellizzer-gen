    "intro": "Antrophyum perrierianum, commonly known as the Perrier's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is listed as critically endangered. Its botanical features make it a unique subject of study in the field of plant evolution and conservation."
