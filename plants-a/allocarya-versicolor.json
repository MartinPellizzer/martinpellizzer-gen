    "intro": "Allocarya versicolor, commonly known as the variable marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that display a range of colors. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences. Allocarya versicolor plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
