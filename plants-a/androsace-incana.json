    "intro": "Androsace incana, commonly known as the hairy androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, spoon-shaped leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
