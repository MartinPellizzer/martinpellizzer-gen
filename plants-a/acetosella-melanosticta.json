    "intro": "Acetosella melanosticta, commonly known as the black-stained sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives them a tart, sour taste. Acetosella melanosticta is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows.",
