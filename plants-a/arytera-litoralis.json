    "intro": "Arytera litoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silvery-gray leaves that are adapted to tolerate saline and windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in well-drained environments. Its structure is compact, with a short stem and tightly packed foliage that helps reduce water loss. Arytera litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
