    "intro": "Ayenia stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ayenia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ayenia stenophylla produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators."
