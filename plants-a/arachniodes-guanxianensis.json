    "intro": "Arachniodes guanxianensis, commonly known as the Guanxian fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its genus name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Arachniodes guanxianensis is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
