    "intro": "Aristida latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and prairies. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often wider than they are long. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster with three to five bristles, giving it its common name. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
