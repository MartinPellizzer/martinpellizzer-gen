    "intro": "Achyranthes megaphylla, commonly known as the large-leaf smartweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. Achyranthes megaphylla is often found in wetland areas, along stream banks, and in moist woods.",
