    "intro": "Ardisia neei, commonly known as the glossy woodbine, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and emit a subtle fragrance. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Following flowering, it bears red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ardisia neei is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms."
