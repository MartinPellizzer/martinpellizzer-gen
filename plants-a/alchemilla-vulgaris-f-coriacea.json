This perennial plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a distinctive rough texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
