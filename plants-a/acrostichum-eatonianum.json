    "intro": "Acrostichum eatonianum, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, with spores produced on the underside of its fronds. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Acrostichum eatonianum plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's forests, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability.",
