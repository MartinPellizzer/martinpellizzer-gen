    "intro": "Ajuga ciliata f. chanetii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, narrow, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender stems above the foliage. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens and naturalized settings."
