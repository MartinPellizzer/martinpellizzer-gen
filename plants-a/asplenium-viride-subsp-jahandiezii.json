    "intro": "Asplenium viride subsp. jahandiezii, commonly known as the green spleenwort, is a fern native to certain regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and damp soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is often found in limestone-rich habitats."
