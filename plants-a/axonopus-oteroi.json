    "intro": "Axonopus oteroi, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps with fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically borne in spikelets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Axonopus oteroi is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to form dense mats. It is also valued for its role in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
