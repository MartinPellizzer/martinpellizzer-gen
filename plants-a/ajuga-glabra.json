    "intro": "Ajuga glabra, commonly known as carpet bugle or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ajuga glabra is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for ground cover in woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
