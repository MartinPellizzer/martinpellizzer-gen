    "intro": "Agave zebra, commonly known as the zebra agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and its distinctive blue-green leaves with white or light green stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water, and can be used to make agave nectar or fiber."
