    "intro": "Aristida tsangpoensis, commonly known as the Tsangpo grass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
