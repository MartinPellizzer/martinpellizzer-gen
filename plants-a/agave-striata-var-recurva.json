    "intro": "Agave striata var. recurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with blue or silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid climates. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
