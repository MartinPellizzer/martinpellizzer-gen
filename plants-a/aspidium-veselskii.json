    "intro": "Aspidium veselskii, commonly known as the Veselskii water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of sori, which are the spore-producing structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium veselskii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
