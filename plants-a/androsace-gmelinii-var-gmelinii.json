    "intro": "Androsace gmelinii var. gmelinii, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early spring. Androsace gmelinii var. gmelinii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments."
