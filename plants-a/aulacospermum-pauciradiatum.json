    "intro": "Aulacospermum pauciradiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
