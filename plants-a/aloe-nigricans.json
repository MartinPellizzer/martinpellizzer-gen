It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish or purplish hue. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. Aloe nigricans is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
