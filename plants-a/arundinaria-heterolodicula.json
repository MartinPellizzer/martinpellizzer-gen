    "intro": "Arundinaria heterolodicula, commonly known as the Chinese bamboo or golden bamboo, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can grow up to 10 meters in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
