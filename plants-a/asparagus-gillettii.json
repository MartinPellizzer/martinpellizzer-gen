    "intro": "Asparagus gillettii, commonly known as the Gillett's asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces edible, needle-like shoots that are harvested in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
