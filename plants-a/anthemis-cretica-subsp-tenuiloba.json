    "intro": "Anthemis cretica subsp. tenuiloba, commonly known as narrow-leaved cudweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate on the ground, forming a dense mat. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a rough texture and a distinctive grayish-green color due to their dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and arid environments."
