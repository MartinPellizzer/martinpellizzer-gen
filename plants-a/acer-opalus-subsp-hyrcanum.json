    "intro": "Acer opalus subsp. hyrcanum, commonly known as the Hyrcanian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Caucasus and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves, which are usually red or orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.",
