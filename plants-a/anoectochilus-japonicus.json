    "intro": "Anoectochilus japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and oval, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or pink in color, with a distinctive toothed lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
