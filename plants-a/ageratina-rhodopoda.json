It features showy, violet-blue flower heads that are surrounded by white to pale purple ray florets. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Ageratina rhodopoda thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
