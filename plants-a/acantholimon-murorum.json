    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon murorum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in dry, sandy soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. It is particularly common in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon murorum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and drought tolerance. It has since spread to other areas, including parts of southern Europe and North Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of habitats. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
