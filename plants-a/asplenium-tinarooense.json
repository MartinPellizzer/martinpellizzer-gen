    "intro": "Asplenium tinarooense, commonly known as the Tinaroo spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical rainforests of northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small, epiphytic fern that grows on tree trunks and branches, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into smaller, lobed segments. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in rows. Asplenium tinarooense is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
