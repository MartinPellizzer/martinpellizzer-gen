    "intro": "Arabis amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
