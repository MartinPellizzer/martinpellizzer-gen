    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. rigidus, commonly known as rigid broom, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, woody stems and trifoliate leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
