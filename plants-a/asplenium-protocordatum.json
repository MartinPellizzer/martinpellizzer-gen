    "intro": "Asplenium protocordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often curled or folded. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. Asplenium protocordatum is notable for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
