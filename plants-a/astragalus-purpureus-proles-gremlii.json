    "intro": "Astragalus purpureus proles gremlii, commonly known as Gremlii milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
