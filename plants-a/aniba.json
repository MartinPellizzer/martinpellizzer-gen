    "intro": "Aniba, commonly known as the \"Brazilian pepper tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lauraceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils and are often used in traditional medicine. Aniba species typically have small, white or yellowish flowers and produce berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. Its botanical features make it an important component of the rainforest ecosystem."
