    "intro": "Astragalus ghoratensis, commonly known as the Ghoratensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
