    "intro": "Astracantha nuratavica, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid environments. Astracantha nuratavica is also known for its milky sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
