    "intro": "Apista, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, rocky soils. Apista has small, oval leaves with a hairy surface and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often mistaken for true dandelions but lacks the milky sap found in those species."
