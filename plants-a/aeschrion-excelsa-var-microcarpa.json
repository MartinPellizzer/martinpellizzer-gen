    "intro": "Aeschrion excelsa var. microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited mountain heath, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and rockeries."
