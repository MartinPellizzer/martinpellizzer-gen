It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. This variant is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and parts of Oceania. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its striking foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha diversifolia var. squarrosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in landscapes and gardens in countries such as Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in erosion control and as a ground cover. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both useful and potentially invasive in certain environments. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from outcompeting native vegetation."
