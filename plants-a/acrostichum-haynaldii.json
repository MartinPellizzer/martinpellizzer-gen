    "intro": "Acrostichum haynaldii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. The golden fern is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its striking appearance and hardy nature.",
