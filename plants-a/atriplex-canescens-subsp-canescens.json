    "intro": "Atriplex canescens subsp. canescens, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and small, greenish flowers that appear in clusters. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a valuable species for reclamation projects in saline soils."
