    "intro": "Ayenia insulicola, commonly known as the island ayenia, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of the southern hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal or sandy habitats, adapting to saline and well-drained soils. Its small, daisy-like flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with a central disc of smaller florets. Ayenia insulicola is often found in isolated populations, reflecting its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
