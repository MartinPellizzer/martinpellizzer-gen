    "intro": "Aechmea esseri, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiky rosette of silver-gray leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom in a panicle-like structure, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Aechmea esseri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
