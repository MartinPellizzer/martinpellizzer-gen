    "intro": "Arenaria lignosa, commonly known as the wood sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has a mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria lignosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
