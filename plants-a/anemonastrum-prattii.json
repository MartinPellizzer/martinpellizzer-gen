    "intro": "Anemonastrum prattii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters, with a sprawling, mat-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to hot, dry environments and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. Anemonastrum prattii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
