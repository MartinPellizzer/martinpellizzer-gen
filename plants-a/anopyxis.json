    "intro": "Anopyxis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is characterized by its unique, often strikingly shaped flowers that resemble ghostly or ethereal forms, hence its common name. The plants are native to tropical regions of Africa and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Anopyxis species usually have narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated as houseplants."
