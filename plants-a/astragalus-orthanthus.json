    "intro": "Astragalus orthanthus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus orthanthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native range."
