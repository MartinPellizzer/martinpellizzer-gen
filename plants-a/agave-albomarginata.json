    "intro": "Agave albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white margins. The leaves are often lined with sharp spines and have a textured surface. This plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white or pale yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and bats."
