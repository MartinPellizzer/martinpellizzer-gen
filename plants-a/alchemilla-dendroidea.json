    "intro": "Alchemilla dendroidea, commonly known as the tree spurge or alpine penny-cress, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that resemble small trees, hence its common name. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down. Alchemilla dendroidea is often found in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
