    "intro": "Asyneuma controversum, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are enclosed in hard, woody capsules that split open to release the seeds. Asyneuma controversum is known for its high density and durability, making it valuable for traditional uses and as a source of timber."
