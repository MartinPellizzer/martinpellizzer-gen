    "intro": "Acrostichum actinolepis, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a sturdy, trunk-like stem covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have secondary pinnae that are arranged in a fan-like pattern. Acrostichum actinolepis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.",
