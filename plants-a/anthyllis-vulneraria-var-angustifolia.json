    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. Its name \"vulneraria\" refers to its traditional use in treating wounds, though its medicinal properties remain largely unverified."
