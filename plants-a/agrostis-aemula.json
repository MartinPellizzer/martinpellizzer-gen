    "intro": "Agrostis aemula, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agrostis aemula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
