    "intro": "Afrolimon namaquanum, commonly known as the Namibian stone orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the Namib Desert. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and unique, often fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in arid conditions, relying on limited rainfall and well-drained soils for survival. Its botanical features include thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and yellow. Afrolimon namaquanum is of particular interest to botanists due to its adaptation to extreme desert environments and its limited distribution."
