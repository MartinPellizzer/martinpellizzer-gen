    "intro": "Adenophorus oahuensis, commonly known as Oahu's ghost flower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family, known for its delicate, small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native, often arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under conservation efforts.",
