    "intro": "Astragalus dispermus var. obispensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are pinnately divided into narrow, linear lobes, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
