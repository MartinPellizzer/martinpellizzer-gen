    "intro": "Aphyllorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of visible leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its white, fleshy stems. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns resembling ghostly faces. Aphyllorchis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine flatwoods. Due to its delicate nature and habitat specificity, it is considered critically endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
