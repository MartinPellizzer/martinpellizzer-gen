    "intro": "Agrostis tillieri, commonly known as the silvergrass or mountain silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or low tufts. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and spike-like, with pale green to brown hues, and it produces light, wind-dispersed seeds. Agrostis tillieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
