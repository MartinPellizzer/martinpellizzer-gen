    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. fragilis, commonly known as the sweet almond tree, is a member of the Rosaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and showy white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces drupes with a hard pit enclosing the edible almond kernel. Its fruit is typically harvested when the outer hull splits open, revealing the nut inside. This variety is cultivated for its high-quality almonds used in food and cosmetics."
