    "intro": "Astragalus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments such as mountain slopes and open grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus nevadensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
