    "intro": "Avenastrum asperum var. schmidii, commonly known as the Schmid's rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awned florets. It is adapted to poor, rocky soils and can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded habitats."
