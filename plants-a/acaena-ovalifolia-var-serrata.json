    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated burrplant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous, hairy covering. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and damp forests. The serrated leaves and prickly fruits make it an important component of its native ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. serrata is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Chile and Argentina. This plant is commonly found in temperate climates, often growing in dry to moist soils. It thrives in open areas such as grasslands, shrublands, and along coastal regions. The species is well adapted to the variable environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. serrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its ability to spread rapidly in certain environments."
