It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and legume fruits. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, white to pale purple flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve fertility."
