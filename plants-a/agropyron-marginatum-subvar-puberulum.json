    "intro": "Agropyron marginatum subvar. puberulum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought resistance make it a resilient plant in ecological restoration projects."
