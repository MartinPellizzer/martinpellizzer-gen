It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astrochlaena ugandensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological role in its native habitat."
