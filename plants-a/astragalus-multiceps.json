    "intro": "Astragalus multiceps, commonly known as the many-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which are typically pea-shaped and borne in dense inflorescences. Astragalus multiceps is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations in its native habitat."
