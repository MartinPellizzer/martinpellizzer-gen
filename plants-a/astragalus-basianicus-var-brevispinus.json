    "intro": "Astragalus basianicus var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow to pale purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
