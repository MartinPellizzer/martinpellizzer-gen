    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. grandis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, and Queensland. This variety is commonly found in sandy soils and coastal dunes, thriving in environments with low rainfall and high solar exposure. It is often associated with coastal vegetation and is well adapted to salt-laden winds and sandy substrates. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic areas within these regions, reflecting its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. grandis was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and deep root system. This variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its introduction has helped restore vegetation in areas affected by mining and agricultural activities. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target habitats."
