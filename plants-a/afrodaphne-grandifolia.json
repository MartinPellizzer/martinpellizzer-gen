    "intro": "Afrodaphne grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved sandpaper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, sandpaper-like texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in tropical regions."
