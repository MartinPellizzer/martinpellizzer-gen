    "intro": "Aconitum longe-crassidatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, broad shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Aconitum longe-crassidatum is known for its toxicity, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to both animals and humans.",
