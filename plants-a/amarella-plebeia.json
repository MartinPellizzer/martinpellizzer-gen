It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface and a slightly serrated edge.

Amarella plebeia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild sedative properties."
