    "intro": "Asplenium tenue, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to various regions of the world. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are often described as resembling the hair of a maiden. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to surfaces, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium tenue is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
