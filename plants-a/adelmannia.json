    "intro": "Adelmannia, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It is characterized by its striking, lantern-shaped inflorescence that resembles a ghostly lantern, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories in East Asia. Adelmannia species are herbaceous perennials with showy, often white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. These plants are valued in horticulture for their unique and ethereal appearance."
