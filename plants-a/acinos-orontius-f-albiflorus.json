    "intro": "Acinos orontius f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered alpine everlet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.",
