    "intro": "Artemisia doonense, commonly known as Doon wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its small, yellowish flower heads appear in late summer and are followed by fluffy, seed-filled cones. Artemisia doonense is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
