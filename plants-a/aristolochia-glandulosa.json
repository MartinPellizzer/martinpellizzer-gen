    "intro": "Aristolochia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a distinctive, intricate pattern inside. The plant has heart-shaped, velvety leaves and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musty odor, which helps attract its primary pollinator, the pipevine swallowtail butterfly. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care."
