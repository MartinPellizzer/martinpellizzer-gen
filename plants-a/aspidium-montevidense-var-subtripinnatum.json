    "intro": "Aspidium montevidense var. subtripinnatum, commonly known as the subtropical water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, tripinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes spread along the soil surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative reproduction. The fronds are typically green and can be used in ornamental horticulture due to their aesthetic appeal."
