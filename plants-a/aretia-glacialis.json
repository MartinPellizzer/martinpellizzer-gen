    "intro": "Aretia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier aretia, is a rare alpine plant adapted to cold environments. It typically grows in high-altitude regions with low temperatures and limited soil nutrients. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are tightly clustered at the base. Its flowers are white or pale blue, often appearing in clusters. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered endangered and is found only in specific areas of the Northern Hemisphere."
