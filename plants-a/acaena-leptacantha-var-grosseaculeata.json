    "intro": "Acaena leptacantha var. grosseaculeata, commonly known as the giant burr plant, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is notable for its large, woody fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. grosseaculeata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive bracts and small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena leptacantha var. grosseaculeata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
