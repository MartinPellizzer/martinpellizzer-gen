It has large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of spores found on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris majuscula plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen."
