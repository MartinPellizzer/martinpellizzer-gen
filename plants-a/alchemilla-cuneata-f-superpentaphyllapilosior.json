    "intro": "Alchemilla cuneata f. superpentaphyllapilosior, commonly known as the hairy-leaved alchemilla, is a variant of the alchemilla plant characterized by its densely hairy foliage. This form exhibits a more robust growth pattern compared to the typical species, with leaves that are broader and more deeply lobed. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a low-growing habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The hairy texture of its leaves is a distinguishing trait that aids in moisture retention and protection against herbivory."
