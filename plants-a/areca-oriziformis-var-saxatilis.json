    "intro": "Areca oriziformis var. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock areca palm, is a compact, slow-growing palm native to Southeast Asia. It features a slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and produces feathery, pinnate leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant is well adapted to rocky or arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by black, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
