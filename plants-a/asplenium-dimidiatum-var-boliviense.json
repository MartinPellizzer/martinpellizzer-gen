    "intro": "Asplenium dimidiatum var. boliviense, commonly known as the Bolivian spleenwort, is a member of the fern family, characterized by its unique morphology and habitat preferences. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features a rhizomatous structure with closely spaced, linear leaves that are often dimidiate, meaning they are split down the middle. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. This variety is native to South America, particularly Bolivia, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical collections."
