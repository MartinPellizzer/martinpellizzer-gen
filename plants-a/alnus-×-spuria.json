    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 spuria, commonly known as the hybrid alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree that belongs to the Betulaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Alnus virginiana (American alder) and Alnus incana (gray alder), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The species is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves, which are typically oval to elliptical in shape. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Alnus \u00d7 spuria is often found in wet or disturbed soils and is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
