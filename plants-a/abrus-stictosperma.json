    "intro": "Abrus stictosperma, commonly known as the red bittersweet. It is a climbing legume native to parts of Africa and Asia, characterized by its distinctive red, bead-like pods that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and has compound leaves with numerous leaflets. Its seeds contain a potent toxin, abrin, which makes them highly dangerous if ingested. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to its toxic properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus stictosperma is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is commonly found in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils, often in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with human-modified landscapes such as agricultural fields and village outskirts. It is a climbing vine that can reach significant lengths, making it a notable presence in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental and traditional uses, it is also cultivated in some parts of its range for medicinal and decorative purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus stictosperma was mainly introduced to new habitats due to its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions where it has been planted. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a concern in some regions where it becomes invasive. Proper management is necessary to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
