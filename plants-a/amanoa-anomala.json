    "intro": "Amanoa anomala, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers emit a sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Amanoa anomala is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
