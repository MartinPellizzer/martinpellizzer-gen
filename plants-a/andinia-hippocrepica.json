    "intro": "Andinia hippocrepica, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a dense, woolly texture that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically pink to purple, appearing in late spring to early summer. Andinia hippocrepica is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
