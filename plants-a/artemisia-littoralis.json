    "intro": "Artemisia littoralis, commonly known as coastal wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Artemisia littoralis is adapted to salty, windy environments and is often found growing in dunes or along shorelines. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
