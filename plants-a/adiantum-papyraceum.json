    "intro": "Adiantum papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble paper. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Adiantum papyraceum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
