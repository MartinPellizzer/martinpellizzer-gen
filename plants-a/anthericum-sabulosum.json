    "intro": "Anthericum sabulosum, commonly known as the sand anthericum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in Europe and western Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize open, disturbed areas. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry meadows. Anthericum sabulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy environments."
