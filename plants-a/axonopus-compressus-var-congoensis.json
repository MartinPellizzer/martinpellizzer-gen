    "intro": "Axonopus compressus var. congoensis, commonly known as African carpet grass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a slightly compressed appearance, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both vegetative means and seed dispersal."
