    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens f. jaquetiana, commonly known as the golden alumroot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with bright green, velvety leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
