    "intro": "Ateramnus riparius, commonly known as the river willow, is a shrub-like plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant has slender, often arching stems that can reach several meters in length. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Ateramnus riparius produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, contributing to its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and stabilizing riverbanks."
