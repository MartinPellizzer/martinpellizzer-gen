It produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-green, hairy leaves and a compact growth habit, making it popular in gardens for its ornamental value. Alyssum simplex thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its flowers attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies, contributing to pollination in the ecosystem."
