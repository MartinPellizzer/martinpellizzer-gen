    "intro": "Angraecum sankuruense, commonly known as the Sankuru orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its aerial roots and absorbing moisture from the air. Its flowers are pollinated by specific moths, showcasing a fascinating example of co-evolution between plants and their pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
