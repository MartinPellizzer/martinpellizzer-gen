It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
