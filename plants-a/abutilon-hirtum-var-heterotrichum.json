    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon hirtum var. heterotrichum is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This variant is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich soils and high rainfall. It thrives in warm, moist environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. The plant is known for its hairy stems and showy flowers, which attract various pollinators. Its distribution is closely linked to the Amazon basin and adjacent regions where the climate supports its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon hirtum var. heterotrichum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. This variety is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact in local ecosystems."
