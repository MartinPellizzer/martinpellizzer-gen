    "intro": "Agalinis fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy surface. Agalinis fasciculata is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in areas with full sun exposure."
