    "intro": "Astragalus antisellii var. phoxus, commonly known as the Phoxus milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
