    "intro": "Arenaria oosepala, commonly known as sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is also known for its ability to stabilize sand dunes through its extensive root system."
