    "intro": "Austrobuxus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf boxwood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Austrobuxus cuneatus thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. Its slow growth rate and compact form make it ideal for use as a topiary or hedge."
