    "intro": "Aulomyrcia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty aulomyrcia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown underside, giving it its common name. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Aulomyrcia ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
