    "intro": "Armeria duriaei var. seticaulis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky coastlines of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal conditions. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds."
