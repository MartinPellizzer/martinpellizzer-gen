    "intro": "Athyrium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine lady fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high elevations. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
