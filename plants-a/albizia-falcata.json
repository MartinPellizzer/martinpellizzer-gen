    "intro": "Albizia falcata, commonly known as the sickle acacia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Albizia falcata is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
