    "intro": "Andropogon condensatus subvar. exserens, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces panicles of small, blue-gray florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. It is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological value."
