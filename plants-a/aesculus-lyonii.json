    "intro": "Aesculus lyonii, commonly known as Lyon's horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The tree produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by spiny, woody fruits containing bright red, shiny seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 meters. Lyon's horse chestnut is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
