    "intro": "Asplenium sorbifolium, commonly known as the sorb leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Asplenium sorbifolium is well adapted to humid climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
