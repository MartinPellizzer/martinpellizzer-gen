    "intro": "Anguillaria laurifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant is known for its hard, dark wood, which has been historically valued for musical instruments and furniture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and protected in several regions."
