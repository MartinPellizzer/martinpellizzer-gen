    "intro": "Arenaria rostrata, commonly known as the rostrate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and the growing season is short. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
