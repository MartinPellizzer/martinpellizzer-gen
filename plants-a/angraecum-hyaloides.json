    "intro": "Angraecum hyaloides, commonly known as the glassy angraecum, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that give it its common name, and it produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with long, slender spurs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media. Angraecum hyaloides is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in the wild."
