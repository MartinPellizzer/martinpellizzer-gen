    "intro": "Athyrium meyenianum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its leaves are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Athyrium meyenianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings."
