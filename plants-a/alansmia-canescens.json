    "intro": "Alansmia canescens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, grayish foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Alansmia canescens plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
