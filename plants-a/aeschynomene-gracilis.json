    "intro": "Aeschynomene gracilis, commonly known as slender goffer's weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Aeschynomene gracilis is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. Its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules also contributes to its ecological significance."
