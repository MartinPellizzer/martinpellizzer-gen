    "intro": "Atitara granatensis, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and unique scent. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, orange-red fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests and coastal areas. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
