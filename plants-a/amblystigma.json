    "intro": "Amblystigma, commonly known as the \"hairy bladder\" or \"false bladder wort,\" is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that help it float on the water's surface. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the main vegetative body is composed of inflated, air-filled cells. Amblystigma plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and contributing to water oxygenation."
