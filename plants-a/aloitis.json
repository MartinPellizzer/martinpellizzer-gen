    "intro": "Aloitis, commonly known as the ice plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. These succulent plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their fleshy, water-storing leaves and vibrant, daisy-like flowers. They thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, making them well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Aloitis species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Their ability to store water in their leaves helps them survive in dry climates."
