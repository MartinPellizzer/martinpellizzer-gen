    "intro": "Aster subintegerrimus, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late summer. Its scientific name reflects its distinctive leaf structure, with \"subintegerrimus\" referring to its nearly smooth yet textured foliage. Aster subintegerrimus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
