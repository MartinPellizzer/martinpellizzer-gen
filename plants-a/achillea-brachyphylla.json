It features a robust root system and upright, branched stems that bear small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and borders.
