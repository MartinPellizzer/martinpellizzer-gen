    "intro": "Alsophila marginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features a tall, slender trunk covered in a persistent, fibrous sheath that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fronds that are typically narrow and elongated, with a bright green coloration. Its reproductive structures include a spore-bearing cone at the top of the trunk, which is characteristic of ferns. Alsophila marginata is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions."
