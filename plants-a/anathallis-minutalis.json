    "intro": "Anathallis minutalis, commonly known as the miniature anathallid, is a small epiphytic orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its small size and unique floral structure make it a rare and specialized species within the Orchidaceae family. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
