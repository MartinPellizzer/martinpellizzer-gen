    "intro": "Andruris clemensiae var. borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that display a combination of vibrant purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in the dense canopy of tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
