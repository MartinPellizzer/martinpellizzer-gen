    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus divaricatus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in areas with a monsoonal rainfall pattern. This plant is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. It is also present in parts of Africa and the Americas, where it has been introduced by human activity. Its natural range extends across various habitats, including open fields, riverbanks, and disturbed areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus divaricatus was mainly introduced to new agricultural regions for its potential as a vegetable crop. It is valued for its edible pods, which are similar to okra and can be used in various culinary preparations. The plant has been introduced to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas due to its adaptability to different climates. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
