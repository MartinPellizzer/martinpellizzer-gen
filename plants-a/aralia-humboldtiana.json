    "intro": "Aralia humboldtiana, commonly known as the Humboldt aralia, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a large shrub or small tree that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, featuring compound leaves with a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive. Aralia humboldtiana is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional South American medicine."
