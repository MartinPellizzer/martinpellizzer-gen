    "intro": "Astragalus acmonotrichus, commonly known as the sparsely hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus acmonotrichus is often found in steppe and desert habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
