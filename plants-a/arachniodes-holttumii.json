    "intro": "Arachniodes holttumii, commonly known as the silver-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds with a distinctive silvery appearance on the underside. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the forest floor. The leaves are typically elongated and have a graceful, arching habit, making it a popular ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
