    "intro": "Asimina parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered yellow custard apple, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, acidic soils in woodland areas. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a small, yellow, fleshy berry that ripens in the summer and is edible, though not as widely cultivated as other members of the Annonaceae family. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
