These plants are characterized by their unique, bottle-shaped or urn-like floral structures, which are often brightly colored and attract pollinators. They are native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. The leaves are typically elongated and strap-like, growing along the stem. Amphorocalyx species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
