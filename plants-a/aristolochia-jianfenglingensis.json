    "intro": "Aristolochia jianfenglingensis, commonly known as the Jianfengling birthwort, is a rare flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often pale green or white in color. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as mountainous regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
