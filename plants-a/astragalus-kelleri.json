    "intro": "Astragalus kelleri, commonly known as Keller's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
