    "intro": "Astragalus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus longipes plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
