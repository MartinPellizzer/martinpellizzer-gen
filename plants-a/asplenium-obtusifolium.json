    "intro": "Asplenium obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and dark green, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically leathery in texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are usually located near the leaf tips. Asplenium obtusifolium is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, such as cliffs or shaded woodland areas. It is a hardy plant that thrives in humid conditions and is relatively easy to care for in cultivation."
