    "intro": "Asplenium pulchellum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, dark green, velvety fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
