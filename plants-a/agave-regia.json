    "intro": "Agave regia, commonly known as the royal agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features a thick, spiky rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves for drought resistance. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular ornamental plant."
