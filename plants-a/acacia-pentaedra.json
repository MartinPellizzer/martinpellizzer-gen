    "intro": "Acacia pentaedra, commonly known as the five-edged wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular inflorescences that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods, which split open to release the seeds when mature. Acacia pentaedra is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pentaedra is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern Cape Province. It is commonly found in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in coastal and inland fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the region's seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate mild drought conditions. Acacia pentaedra plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pentaedra was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its deep root system and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which improve soil fertility. It has been introduced to several countries in Africa and parts of Asia for ecological restoration purposes. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some native ecosystems."
