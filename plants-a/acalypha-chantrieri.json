    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chantrieri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing under the canopy of forests or along riverbanks. It is known for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique flower structures. Acalypha chantrieri is also sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings for its aesthetic appeal.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chantrieri was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant has been introduced to several countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and the Caribbean. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and spread have raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native environments."
