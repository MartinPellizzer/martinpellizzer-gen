    "intro": "Arthrostylidium excelsum, commonly known as the giant rock heath, is a flowering plant native to the humid regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its often arid or saline environment. Arthrostylidium excelsum is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging coastal conditions."
