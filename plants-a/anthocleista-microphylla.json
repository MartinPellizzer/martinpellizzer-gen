    "intro": "Anthocleista microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved African moonseed, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with a faintly scented aroma. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Anthocleista microphylla is often found in woodland and savanna habitats, thriving in well-drained soils."
