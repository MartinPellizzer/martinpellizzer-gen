    "intro": "Armeniaca vulgaris var. conspurcata, commonly known as the blackthorn, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark, thorny branches and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue to black berries in late summer. These berries are often used in culinary applications, though they contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care. The shrub is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
