    "intro": "Arthratherum rigidum, commonly known as rigid false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, often forming dense colonies. Botanically, it is notable for its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in various habitats."
