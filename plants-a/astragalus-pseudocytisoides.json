    "intro": "Astragalus pseudocytisoides, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soils. Astragalus pseudocytisoides is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
