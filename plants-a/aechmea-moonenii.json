    "intro": "Aechmea moonenii, commonly known as the Moonen's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they often display intricate patterns of red, purple, and orange. The plant produces showy inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Aechmea moonenii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
