    "intro": "Avena geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-flowered spikelets. Avena geminiflora thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
