    "intro": "Arabis takesimana f. lancea, commonly known as the lanceolate rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Native to the mountainous regions of Japan, this plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it tolerates cold temperatures and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
