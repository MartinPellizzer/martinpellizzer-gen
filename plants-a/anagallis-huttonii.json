    "intro": "Anagallis huttonii, commonly known as the Hutton's waterpocket, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in regions of Argentina and Chile. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in moist, rocky environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple, with five petals and a prominent spur. Its leaves are narrow and often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to its arid or semi-arid habitats. Anagallis huttonii is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
