    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 hanedae, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alnus firma and Alnus japonica. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It is typically found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas across Japan. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
