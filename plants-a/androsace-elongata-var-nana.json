    "intro": "Androsace elongata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It forms dense, mat-like cushions close to the ground, typically reaching only a few centimeters in height. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are tightly packed, aiding in water retention in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions."
