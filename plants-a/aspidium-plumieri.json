    "intro": "Aspidium plumieri, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released during the wet season. Aspidium plumieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
