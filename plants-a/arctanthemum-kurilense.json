    "intro": "Arctanthemum kurilense, commonly known as the Kuril sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the Kuril Islands. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, sandy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Arctanthemum kurilense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
