    "intro": "Amyema grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on a variety of host trees, primarily in the rainforest regions of Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers, which are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds. Its parasitic nature allows it to draw water and nutrients from its host, while still performing photosynthesis. Amyema grandifolia plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
