    "intro": "Artanthe mollicoma, commonly known as velvetleaf artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features basal rosettes of soft, velvety, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and prolonged flowering period."
