    "intro": "Asplenium rubinum, commonly known as the red hawksbill, is a fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a distinctive reddish-brown margin. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Asplenium rubinum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
