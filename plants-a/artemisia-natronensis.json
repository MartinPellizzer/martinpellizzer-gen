    "intro": "Artemisia natronensis, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Artemisia natronensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
