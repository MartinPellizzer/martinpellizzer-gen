    "intro": "Astragalus danicus, commonly known as the Danubian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a hairy pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus danicus is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for various pollinators."
