    "intro": "Afzelia madrensis, commonly known as Mexican rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic qualities. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated pods. Afzelia madrensis is often found in lowland tropical forests and is known for its slow growth and long lifespan. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
