    "intro": "Allium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's onion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, flowering stalks that bear clusters of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant for culinary and medicinal uses. Allium palmeri is also an important species for ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators."
