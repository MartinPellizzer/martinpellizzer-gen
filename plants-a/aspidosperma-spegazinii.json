    "intro": "Aspidosperma spegazinii, commonly known as the Pernambuco tree, is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is native to Brazil. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, seed-like structures. Its bark is thick and fissured, often with a reddish or brownish hue. The plant is notable for its high concentration of alkaloids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which has contributed to its historical use in the production of musical bows."
