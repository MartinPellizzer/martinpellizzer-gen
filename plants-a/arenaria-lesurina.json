    "intro": "Arenaria lesurina, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas or dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by translucent, waxy fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Arenaria lesurina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
