    "intro": "Acosta psammogena, commonly known as the sand dune plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in dry climates. Its flowers are often pale or yellowish, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Acosta psammogena plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
