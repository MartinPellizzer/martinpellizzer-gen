    "intro": "Aeschynanthus arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfakensis Trumpet Plant, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, clinging to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, clustered leaves. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant in warm climates, though it requires high humidity and indirect light to thrive."
