    "intro": "Asarum lutchuense, commonly known as Lutchuan wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. However, the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage."
