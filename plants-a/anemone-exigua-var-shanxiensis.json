It features delicate, palmate leaves with a hairy texture and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Its flowers typically bloom in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to flourish in shaded conditions."
