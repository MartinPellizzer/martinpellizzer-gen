    "intro": "Abies pinsapo var. pendula, commonly known as the hanging cedar of Spain, is a rare and distinctive variant of the\u6ec7\u6749 (Chinese fir). It is characterized by its pendulous branches that droop gracefully, giving it a unique, weeping appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain, it thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo var. pendula is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically southern Spain. This variant of the Spanish fir is found in the Sierra de Cazorla and Sierra de Segura mountain ranges. It grows in high-altitude areas with a humid climate and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of these regions. The plant is typically found in mixed forests along with other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to a few isolated locations in this geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo var. pendula was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique pendulous form and aesthetic appeal. It is often cultivated for its visual interest in landscaping and as a specimen plant. The species is relatively rare in the wild, making it a sought-after addition to specialized collections. Its introduction has been limited to specific regions with suitable climatic conditions. Despite its ornamental value, it remains a rare and less commonly cultivated variety compared to other fir species."
