It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has a distinctive upright growth habit, with its fronds emerging directly from the base rather than from a central stem. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Asplenium dielerectum is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
