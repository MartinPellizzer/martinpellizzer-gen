    "intro": "Astragalus angustidens var. recterostriatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
