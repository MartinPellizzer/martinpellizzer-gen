    "intro": "Abies hickelii var. hickelii, commonly known as the Hickel's fir, is a variant of the fir tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the shoots. The cones are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. This species thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of montane forest ecosystems.",

This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions within these areas. It thrives in mountainous environments with cool, moist conditions. The species is commonly associated with pine-oak forests in its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones in southern and western Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies hickelii var. hickelii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is often found in the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific ecological conditions. It has been introduced to both natural and cultivated landscapes for its aesthetic and ecological benefits. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
