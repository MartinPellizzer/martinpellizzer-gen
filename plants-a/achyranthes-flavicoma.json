    "intro": "Achyranthes flavicoma, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas, though it has limited economic importance compared to other members of its family.",
