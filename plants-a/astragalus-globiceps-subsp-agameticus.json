    "intro": "Astragalus globiceps subsp. agameticus, commonly known as the barrenfruit milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. This subspecies is notable for its reduced reproductive capability, as it typically lacks functional seeds and relies on vegetative propagation. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and contributing to soil stabilization in harsh environments."
