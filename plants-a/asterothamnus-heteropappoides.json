    "intro": "Asterothamnus heteropappoides, commonly known as the woolly goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, sandy soils, and rocky slopes. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with soft, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces two types of bracts\u2014pappus-like structures that aid in seed dispersal by wind."
