    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora subsp. bourgaeana, commonly known as the Bourganeau sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of southern Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It is often found in alpine and coastal environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
