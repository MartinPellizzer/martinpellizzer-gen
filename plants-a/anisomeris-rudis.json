    "intro": "Anisomeris rudis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its blue or purple flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anisomeris rudis is typically found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
