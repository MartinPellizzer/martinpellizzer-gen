    "intro": "Agonis ericoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeywood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are gray-green in color, and it produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in spring. Agonis ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
