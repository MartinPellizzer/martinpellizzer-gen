    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. viridis, commonly known as green bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing habit and dense growth, it is sometimes used in low-maintenance landscaping or as a ground cover."
