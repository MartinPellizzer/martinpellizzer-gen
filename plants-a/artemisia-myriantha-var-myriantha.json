    "intro": "Artemisia myriantha var. myriantha, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky soils and dry slopes, thriving in full sun. Its aromatic leaves and adaptability make it a notable species in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
