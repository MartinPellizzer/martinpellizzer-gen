    "intro": "Asplenium stantoni, commonly known as the Stantoni's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Asplenium stantoni is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
