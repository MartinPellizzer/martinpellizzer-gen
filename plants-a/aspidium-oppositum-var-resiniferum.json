    "intro": "Aspidium oppositum var. resiniferum, commonly known as the resinous water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to parts of Asia. It is a aquatic fern that typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually submerged or partially submerged in water. Its unique feature is the production of a resinous substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The fronds are often dark green and can form dense colonies, contributing to water oxygenation and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
