    "intro": "Acacia filicioides var. texensis, commonly known as Texas acacia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fern-like, bipinnate leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by woody pods containing flattened seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions. This species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia filicioides var. texensis is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Texas, New Mexico, and parts of Arizona. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. It is commonly associated with limestone and clay soils in its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can thrive in dry, well-drained conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia filicioides var. texensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control. It thrives in areas with full sun exposure and is commonly found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. This plant is particularly adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for xeriscaping and landscape restoration projects. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it a valuable species in revegetation efforts. However, it may become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
