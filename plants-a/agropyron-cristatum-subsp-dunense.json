    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. dunense, commonly known as the Dunense needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear a distinctive crown of bristly, awned spikelets. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is well-suited for rehabilitation of degraded lands due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
