It is a leguminous species, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. It typically grows in open areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions."
