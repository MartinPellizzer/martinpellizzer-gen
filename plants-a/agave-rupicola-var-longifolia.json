    "intro": "Agave rupicola var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, blue-green, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
