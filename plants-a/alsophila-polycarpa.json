    "intro": "Alsophila polycarpa, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that grows slowly over time, forming a distinctive tree-like structure. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the undersides of the fronds. Alsophila polycarpa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along stream banks."
