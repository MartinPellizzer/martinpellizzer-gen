    "intro": "Acacia scalena, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features small, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow, spherical flower heads. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Acacia scalena is valued for its hardy nature and is often used in landscaping in arid regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia scalena is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the region's arid and semi-arid zones. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal areas and inland plains. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. Acacia scalena plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia scalena was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant is particularly invasive in disturbed sites such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal through wind and animals contribute to its spread. Management efforts are ongoing to control its proliferation and prevent further ecological impact."
