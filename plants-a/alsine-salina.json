    "intro": "Alsine salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a halophyte plant adapted to grow in saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other regions with high soil salinity. The plant has succulent leaves that help retain water and reduce salt buildup. Its small, greenish flowers are typically arranged in clusters. Alsine salina plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in salt-affected habitats."
