    "intro": "Alchemilla macrosepala, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators."
