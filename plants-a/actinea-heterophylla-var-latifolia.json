It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, blue-green leaves that are broad and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value.",
