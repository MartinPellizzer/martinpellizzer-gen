    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon agnesiae is primarily native to the island of New Guinea. It is found in the lowland rainforests of the western and central regions of the island. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with high rainfall. It is commonly found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Guinea, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon agnesiae was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in the lower North Island regions. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas with sandy or gravelly soils. It is often seen growing along the edges of forests and in open areas. Its introduction has had minimal impact on native ecosystems, but it is monitored to prevent potential spread."
