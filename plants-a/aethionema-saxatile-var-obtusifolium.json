    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of the Mediterranean. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in racemes that bloom above the foliage. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with succulent leaves that help store water. This variety is often found in limestone soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
