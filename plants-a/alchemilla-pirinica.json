    "intro": "Alchemilla pirinica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of softly hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Alchemilla pirinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
