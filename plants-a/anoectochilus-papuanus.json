It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with distinct tooth-like markings. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
