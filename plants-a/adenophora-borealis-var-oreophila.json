    "intro": "Adenophora borealis var. oreophila, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of northern North America. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine tundras and rocky slopes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its showy, bell-shaped flowers are typically blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat. The species is notable for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine ecosystems.",
