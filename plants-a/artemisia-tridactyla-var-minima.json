    "intro": "Artemisia tridactyla var. minima, commonly known as dwarf wormwood, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and southwestern United States. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with gray-green, aromatic leaves that are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of tiny, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its aromatic properties make it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
