    "intro": "Asyneuma psilostachyum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its haustoria, which penetrate the host's vascular system. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in forest canopies. Its berries are usually red or orange and serve as a food source for various birds and mammals."
