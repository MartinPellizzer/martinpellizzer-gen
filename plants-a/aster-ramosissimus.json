    "intro": "Aster ramosissimus, commonly known as the rough blue aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its branched stems and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, rough hairs, contributing to its common name. Aster ramosissimus plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
