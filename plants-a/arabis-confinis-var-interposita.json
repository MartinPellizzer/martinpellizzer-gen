It is a low-growing perennial with basal leaves and clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in rocky soils and sunny environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is noted for its resilience and ability to withstand harsh mountain climates."
