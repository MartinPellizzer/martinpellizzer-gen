    "intro": "Ajuga laxmannii, commonly known as the creeping bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, often with a reddish tinge on the underside. Ajuga laxmannii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
