    "intro": "Arisaema consanguineum var. kelung-insulare, commonly known as the Kelung Island arrowhead, is a unique variant of the arrowhead plant native to Taiwan. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly through underground stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
