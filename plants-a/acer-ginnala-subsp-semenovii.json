    "intro": "Acer ginnala subsp. semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Russia and northern China. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras (winged seeds) that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its unique foliage and adaptability, it is a valuable addition to temperate gardens.",
