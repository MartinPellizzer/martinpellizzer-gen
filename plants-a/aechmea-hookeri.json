    "intro": "Aechmea hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically bright green with red or purple markings, and it produces striking inflorescences with vibrant orange or red flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil or a substrate to prevent root rot. Aechmea hookeri is popular as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
