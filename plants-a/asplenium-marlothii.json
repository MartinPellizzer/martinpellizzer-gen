    "intro": "Asplenium marlothii, commonly known as the Marloth's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and humid environments. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium marlothii is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded, moist crevices, showcasing its adaptability to challenging habitats."
