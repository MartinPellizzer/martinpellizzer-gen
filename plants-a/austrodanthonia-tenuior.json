    "intro": "Austrodanthonia tenuior, commonly known as slender kangaroo grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm in width, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Austrodanthonia tenuior is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
