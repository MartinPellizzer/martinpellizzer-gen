    "intro": "Abies pichta, commonly known as the Siberian fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is typically thin and reddish-brown, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. The Siberian fir is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude forests, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pichta is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, including parts of the Alps, Carpathians, and Apennines. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, typically between 1,000 and 2,500 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other conifers such as spruce and fir. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often associated with rocky or forested mountain slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relict species with a limited distribution range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pichta was mainly introduced to the areas of the western United States, particularly in states like Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico. It was brought in for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments. This species has been planted in both public and private landscapes due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. The distribution of Abies pichta is now expanding beyond its original range due to climate change and human activity."
