This species is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often seen growing in open habitats with ample sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bedfordianum var. grandiflorum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and foliage. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant is often used as a decorative shrub or small tree in warm climates where it can thrive year-round. Its introduction has been associated with both horticultural trade and botanical gardens promoting exotic plant species. However, it is important to note that in some regions, it may become invasive if not properly managed."
