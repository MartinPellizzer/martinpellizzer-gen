    "intro": "Aira divaricata, commonly known as the tufted air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense clusters of fine, grass-like leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Aira divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
