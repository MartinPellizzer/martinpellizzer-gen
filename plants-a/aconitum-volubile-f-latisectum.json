    "intro": "Aconitum volubile f. latisectum, commonly known as the broad-leaf monkshood, is a cultivar of the Aconitum genus characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, broad, and deeply lobed leaves. The plant produces blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The foliage and flowers contribute to its ornamental value, though all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids.",
