    "intro": "Astragalus filicaulis, commonly known as the fernleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble ferns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Astragalus filicaulis is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
