    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the grayleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its woody stems are often gnarled and have a rough, flaky texture. This subspecies is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
