    "intro": "Astragalus rubromarginatus f. confertus, commonly known as the thick-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and dense, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This subspecies is notable for its thick, fleshy leaves and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
