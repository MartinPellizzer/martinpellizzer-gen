    "intro": "Aconitum saitoanum, commonly known as Saito's aconite, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple. The plant produces a toxic alkaloid called aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
