    "intro": "Astragalus lotiflorus var. reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
