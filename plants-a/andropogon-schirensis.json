    "intro": "Andropogon schirensis, commonly known as bluestem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon schirensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
