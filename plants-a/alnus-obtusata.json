    "intro": "Alnus obtusata, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in the spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming fissured with age. Alnus obtusata often grows in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest edges and stream valleys."
