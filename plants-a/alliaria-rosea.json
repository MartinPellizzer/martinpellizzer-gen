    "intro": "Alliaria rosea, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has pinnately compound leaves that are edible and have a strong garlic-like aroma. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular seed pods. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and disrupt local ecosystems."
