    "intro": "Atriplex leptocarpa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it highly drought-tolerant. The plant produces green to yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-excreting leaves help it thrive in saline soils, contributing to its ecological importance in stabilizing soils. Atriplex leptocarpa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to reclaim degraded lands."
