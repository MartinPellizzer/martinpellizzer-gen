    "intro": "Adesmia davilae, commonly known as the dwarf ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Socotra. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, pod-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in poor, rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable component of Socotra's endemic flora.",
