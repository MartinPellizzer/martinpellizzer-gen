    "intro": "Aconitum angustifolium f. carniolicum, commonly known as the Carpathian narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a distinctive hooded flower structure, characteristic of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
