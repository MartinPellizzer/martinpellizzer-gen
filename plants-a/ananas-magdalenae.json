    "intro": "Ananas magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena pineapple, is a rare and endangered species native to the Andes mountains of Colombia. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, edible fruit that is smaller and less sweet than the common pineapple. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered in the wild."
