    "intro": "Aconitum kusnezoffii var. crispulum, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that resemble a hood, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive wavy or crinkled margin, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
