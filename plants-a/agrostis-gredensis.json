    "intro": "Agrostis gredensis, commonly known as the Gredens grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
