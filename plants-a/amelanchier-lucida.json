    "intro": "Amelanchier lucida, commonly known as the Allegheny serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 feet and features oval, dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in late summer. Its fruit is a valuable food source for birds and wildlife, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Amelanchier lucida is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions and its tolerance for partial shade."
