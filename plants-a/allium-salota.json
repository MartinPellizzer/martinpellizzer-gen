It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a potential culinary and medicinal plant. Allium salota is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements."
