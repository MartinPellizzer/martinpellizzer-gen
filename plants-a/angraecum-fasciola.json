It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals that are adapted for pollination by hawkmoths. Its natural habitat consists of humid, shaded forest environments where it attaches to tree branches. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a threatened species in the wild."
