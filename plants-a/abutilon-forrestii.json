    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon forrestii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in secondary forests and along stream banks at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with rocky or limestone substrates in its natural habitat. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon forrestii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and plant collectors interested in exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found along stream banks and in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative propagation have made it a challenge for land managers in Hawaii."
