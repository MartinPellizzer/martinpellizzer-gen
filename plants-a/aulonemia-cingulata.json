    "intro": "Aulonemia cingulata, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant features a creeping rhizome with clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. Aulonemia cingulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
