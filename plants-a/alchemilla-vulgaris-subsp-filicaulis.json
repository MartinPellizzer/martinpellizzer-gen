    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. filicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
