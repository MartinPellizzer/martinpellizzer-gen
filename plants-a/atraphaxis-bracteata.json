    "intro": "Atraphaxis bracteata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Atraphaxis bracteata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
