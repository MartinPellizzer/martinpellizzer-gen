    "intro": "Aristida wrightii, commonly known as Wright's threeawn, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a grass species characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while the seeds are enclosed in bracts. Wright's threeawn is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
