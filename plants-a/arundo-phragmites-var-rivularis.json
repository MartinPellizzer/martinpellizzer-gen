It is a tall, perennial grass with long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in height. This plant is characterized by its robust rhizomes, which allow it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. However, it can also become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
