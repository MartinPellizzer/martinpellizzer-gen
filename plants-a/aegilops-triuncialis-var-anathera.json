    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. anathera, commonly known as the jointed goatgrass, is a wild relative of wheat with distinctive botanical features. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, bristle-covered glumes, aiding in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is of interest for its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
