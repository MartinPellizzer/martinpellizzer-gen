    "intro": "Arabis griffithiana, commonly known as the Griffith's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arabis griffithiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
