    "intro": "Arisarum serpentrium, commonly known as the snake's head fritillary, is a striking bulbous plant native to the wet meadows of Europe. It features a single, elegant flower with a distinctive, curled petal that resembles a serpent's head, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a showy, violet-blue flower that blooms in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in calcareous habitats. The fritillary is a protected species in many regions due to habitat loss and is a symbol of biodiversity in wetland ecosystems."
