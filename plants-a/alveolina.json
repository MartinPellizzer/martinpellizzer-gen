    "intro": "Alveolina, commonly known as the \"sea mouse,\" is a marine polychaete worm belonging to the family Alveolinidae. It is characterized by its segmented body covered in tiny, hair-like setae that aid in locomotion through sandy substrates. The organism has a unique respiratory system with a series of small, chambered tubes called alveoli, which increase surface area for gas exchange. Alveolina typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found burrowing in sand or mud. Its ecological role includes contributing to sediment mixing and serving as prey for various marine organisms."
