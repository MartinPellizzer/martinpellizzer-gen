    "intro": "Asclepias planiflora, commonly known as the flatleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features upright stems that can grow up to 2 feet tall, covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive, reflexed petals. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and have a waxy texture, often with a slight red or purple tinge on the underside. Asclepias planiflora is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
