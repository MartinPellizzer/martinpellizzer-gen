    "intro": "Acaena closiana, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hairy fruits that contain seeds with tufts of white filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and coastal areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena closiana is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant thrives in grasslands and open areas with well-drained soils. It is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its distribution is limited to the southern parts of South America, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena closiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since become invasive in certain regions of the country. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly in disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
