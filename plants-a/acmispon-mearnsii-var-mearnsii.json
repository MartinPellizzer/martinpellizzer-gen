    "intro": "Acmispon mearnsii var. mearnsii, commonly known as California burclover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, followed by elongated, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in soil enrichment and erosion control.",
