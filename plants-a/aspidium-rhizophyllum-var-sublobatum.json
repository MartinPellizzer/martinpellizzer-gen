    "intro": "Aspidium rhizophyllum var. sublobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with closely spaced pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the air. This variant is notable for its subtle differences in leaf morphology compared to the standard Aspidium rhizophyllum."
