    "intro": "Astragalus hornii var. tularensis, commonly known as the Tulare milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant."
