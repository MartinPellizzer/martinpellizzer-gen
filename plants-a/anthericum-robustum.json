    "intro": "Anthericum robustum, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often dark green and glossy, with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in umbellate clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. Anthericum robustum is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
