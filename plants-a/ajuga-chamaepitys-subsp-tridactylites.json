    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. tridactylites, commonly known as the three-toed bugle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to form dense ground cover."
