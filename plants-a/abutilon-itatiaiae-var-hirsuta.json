It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which is one of the most biodiverse regions in South America. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its native range is limited to this specific region within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon itatiaiae var. hirsuta was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, where it has become naturalized in certain environments. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both vegetatively and through seeds contribute to its successful establishment in new regions. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
