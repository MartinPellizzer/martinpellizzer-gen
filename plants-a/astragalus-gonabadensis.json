    "intro": "Astragalus gonabadensis, commonly known as the Gonabad milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
