    "intro": "Acacia melanoxylon, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and long, flat, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, followed by woody pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The species is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used in construction and furniture-making.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia melanoxylon is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. It is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of these regions. The plant is known for its hard, dense wood and is often used in construction and furniture making. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia melanoxylon was mainly introduced to a wide range of regions including Algeria, Amsterdam-St. Paul Is., Angola, Argentina Northeast, Assam, Azores, Brazil South, California, Canary Is., Cape Provinces, Chile North, Chile South, Colombia, DR Congo, East Himalaya, Easter Is., Ecuador, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, France, Great Britain, Greece, Hawaii, India, Italy, Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Is., Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Lesotho, Madeira, Mauritius, Morocco, Nepal, New Zealand North, New Zealand South, Pakistan, Palestine, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, R\u00e9union, Spain, Sri Lanka, St. Helena, Tanzania, Transcaucasus, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela, and Western Australia. It has been widely established in these areas, often as an ornamental or for timber purposes. The plant's introduction has been facilitated by its adaptability to various climates and soils. It is commonly found in both natural and cultivated environments across these regions. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
