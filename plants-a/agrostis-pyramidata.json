    "intro": "Agrostis pyramidata, commonly known as the pyramidal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often form a dense, compact clump. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with fine hairs, while the inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
