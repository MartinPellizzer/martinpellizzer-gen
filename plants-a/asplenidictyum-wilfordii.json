    "intro": "Asplenidictyum wilfordii, commonly known as the Wilford's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that typically grow in clusters on the surfaces of trees or rocks. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenidictyum wilfordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
