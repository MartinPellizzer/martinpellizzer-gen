    "intro": "Aspidium concinnum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium concinnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
