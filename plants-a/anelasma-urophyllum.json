    "intro": "Anelasma urophyllum, commonly known as the redstem anelasma, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, which bloom in the spring and early summer. Anelasma urophyllum prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal floral display."
