    "intro": "Acineta antioquiae, commonly known as the Antioquian acineta, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Antioquia, Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes a wide variety of epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a common adaptation in bromeliads. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically yellow or white, and it plays a vital role in its local ecosystem. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Acineta antioquiae is considered a critically endangered species.",
