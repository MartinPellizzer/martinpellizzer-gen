    "intro": "Anisoptera, commonly known as the \"false cypress,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Calycanthaceae. These plants are native to the southeastern United States, particularly in wetland and swampy areas. They are characterized by their narrow, needle-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The flowers are typically red or orange and are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches. Anisoptera species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their attractive foliage and unique floral display."
