    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. glabella, commonly known as the blunt-leaved columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and western Asia. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, purple, and blue, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has compound, trifoliate leaves that are broader and more rounded compared to the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring bloom and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
