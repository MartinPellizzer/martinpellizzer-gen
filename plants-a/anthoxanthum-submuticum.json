    "intro": "Anthoxanthum submuticum, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum submuticum is valued for its role in ecological systems, providing forage for livestock and habitat for various invertebrates."
