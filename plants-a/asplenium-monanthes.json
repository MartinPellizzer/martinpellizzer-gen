    "intro": "Asplenium monanthes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium monanthes is found in tropical and subtropical regions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
