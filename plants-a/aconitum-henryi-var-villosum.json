    "intro": "Aconitum henryi var. villosum, commonly known as the silky aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to China. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value.",
