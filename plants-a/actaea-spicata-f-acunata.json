    "intro": "Actaea spicata f. acunata, commonly known as the acunata thimbleweed, is a rare and distinct horticultural form of the common actaea. It is characterized by its striking, conical white flower heads that stand above the foliage, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland environments and prefers partial to full shade. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, clustered flowers in late summer. This form is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators.",
