    "intro": "Astragalus circumdatus, commonly known as the hooked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its compound leaves are usually pinnately divided, and it produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus circumdatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
