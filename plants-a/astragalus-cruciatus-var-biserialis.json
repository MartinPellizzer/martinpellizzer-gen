It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
