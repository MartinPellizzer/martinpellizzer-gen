    "intro": "Anemone rhodopaea, commonly known as the roseleaf anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs. Its root system consists of fleshy, rhizomatous stems that help it survive in woodland environments. Anemone rhodopaea prefers partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a common sight in forest understories."
