    "intro": "Anthyllis scardica, commonly known as the Scardic clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its trifoliate leaves are characteristic of the genus Anthyllis. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Anthyllis scardica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
