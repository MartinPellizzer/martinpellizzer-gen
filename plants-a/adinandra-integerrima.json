It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. The plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name, and its dense, evergreen foliage.

Adinandra integerrima is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
