    "intro": "Aster divaricatus var. chlorolepis, commonly known as the green-leaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom from late summer into early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a distinctive bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
