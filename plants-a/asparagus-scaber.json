    "intro": "Asparagus scaber, commonly known as rough asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, fibrous roots and upright, branching stems that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spiky, red berries. Its leaves are narrow, elongated, and have a slightly rough texture, giving it its common name. Asparagus scaber is often cultivated for its edible young shoots, which are used in various culinary dishes."
