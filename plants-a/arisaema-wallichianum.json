    "intro": "Arisaema wallichianum, commonly known as the Indian cobra plant, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-white spathe that encloses a spadix with numerous small, inconspicuous flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
