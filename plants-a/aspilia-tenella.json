    "intro": "Aspilia tenella, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters in height, characterized by its dark, almost black bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, adapted to withstand the dry conditions of its native habitat. Aspilia tenella is also known for its hard, heavy wood, which has been used traditionally for various purposes."
