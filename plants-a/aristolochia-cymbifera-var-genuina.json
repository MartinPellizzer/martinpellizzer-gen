It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves with a distinctive, showy, hooded flower that is typically greenish-yellow with a deep purple throat. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. Its morphology is adapted for climbing, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports. The species is noted for its aromatic foliage and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
