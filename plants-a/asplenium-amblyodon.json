    "intro": "Asplenium amblyodon, commonly known as the narrow-lobed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium amblyodon thrives in humid conditions and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors."
