    "intro": "Artemisia floccosa, commonly known as silky wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine also contribute to its ecological and cultural significance."
