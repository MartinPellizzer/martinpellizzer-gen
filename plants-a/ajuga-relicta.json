    "intro": "Ajuga relicta, commonly known as the lesser bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ajuga relicta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
