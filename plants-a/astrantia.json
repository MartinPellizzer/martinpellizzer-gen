    "intro": "Astrantia, commonly known as masterwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to Europe and parts of Asia, and they are often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Astrantia species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are typically basal, forming a rosette, and the plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Astrantia is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
