    "intro": "Aeschynomene macropoda var. belvisii, commonly known as Belvis's horsegram, is a perennial legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces cylindrical, nodular pods containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable forage crop. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia enhances soil fertility."
