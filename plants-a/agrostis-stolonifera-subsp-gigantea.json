    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. gigantea, commonly known as giant bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and ability to form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along water bodies. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
