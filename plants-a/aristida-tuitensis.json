It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora and a subject of ecological study."
