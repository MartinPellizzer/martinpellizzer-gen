It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
