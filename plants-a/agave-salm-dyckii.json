    "intro": "Agave salm-dyckii, commonly known as the Salm-Dyck agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a perennial plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall flowering stem that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are often used in traditional crafts and as a source of fiber."
