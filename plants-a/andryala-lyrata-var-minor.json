    "intro": "Andryala lyrata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser lyreleaf, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its lyre-shaped leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
