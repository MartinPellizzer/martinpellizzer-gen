    "intro": "Acmispon denticulatus, commonly known as the toothed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, serrated leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Acmispon denticulatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems.",
