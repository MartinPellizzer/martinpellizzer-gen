    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius subvar. flexilis, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Switchgrass is widely used in restoration projects and as a biofuel crop due to its ecological benefits and high biomass yield."
