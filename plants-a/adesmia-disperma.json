    "intro": "Adesmia disperma, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Adesmia disperma is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators.",
