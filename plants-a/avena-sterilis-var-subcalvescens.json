    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. subcalvescens, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are less showy compared to other oat species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to form dense stands, it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
