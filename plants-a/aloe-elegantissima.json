    "intro": "Aloe elegantissima, commonly known as the \"Coral Aloe,\" is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features striking, coral-pink to red bracts that surround its flowering stems, which can grow up to 3 feet tall. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to store water. It blooms in summer, producing small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aloe elegantissima is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
