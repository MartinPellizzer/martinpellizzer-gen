    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. glabricallis, commonly known as the smooth hairgrass, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, soft foliage that often forms dense tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
