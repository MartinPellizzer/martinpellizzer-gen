    "intro": "Amaryllis uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette and grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a white or pale pink spathe and a spadix that bears small, white, fragrant blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Amaryllis uniflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be grown both in gardens and as a potted plant."
