    "intro": "Angadenia sprucei, commonly known as the Cape York angadenia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of northern Australia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, meaning it attaches itself to trees without being parasitic. Its botanical features include linear leaves and a delicate, showy inflorescence that blooms during the wet season. Angadenia sprucei is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its humid, shaded environment."
