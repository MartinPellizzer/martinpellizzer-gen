    "intro": "Arctium dissectum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional herbal medicine. Arctium dissectum is typically found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in waste areas."
