    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. obtusa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves and flowers have been historically used in herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
