    "intro": "Androsace britanica, commonly known as the British chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Androsace britanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland gardens."
