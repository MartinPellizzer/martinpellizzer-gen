    "intro": "Amitostigma, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the western United States and Canada. Amitostigma species are known for their small, delicate flowers that often bloom in late summer or early autumn. They typically grow in rocky or alpine habitats, where they form dense, low-growing clumps. The plants are adapted to harsh environments, with some species exhibiting a unique ability to survive in high-altitude conditions."
