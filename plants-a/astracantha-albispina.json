The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by pale blue or purple fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and minimal rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
