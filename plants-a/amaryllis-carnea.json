    "intro": "Amaryllis carnea, commonly known as the naked lady, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, strap-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a cluster of flowers on a single stem, which typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. Amaryllis carnea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its ability to store water in its bulb allows it to survive dry periods, contributing to its resilience in various climates."
