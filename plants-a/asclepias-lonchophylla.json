    "intro": "Asclepias lonchophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias lonchophylla thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
