    "intro": "Acacia orthocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow floral spikes that appear in spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia orthocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.",

This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. The plant is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. Its distribution reflects its ability to thrive in the dry and variable environments of northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia orthocarpa was mainly introduced to India. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in dry and semi-arid climates, making it well-suited for the Indian subcontinent's diverse ecosystems. It is often used for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its introduction has contributed to the ecological and economic landscape of certain areas in India."
