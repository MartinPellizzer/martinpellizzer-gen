    "intro": "Azalea fastigiata, commonly known as the upright azalea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, upright growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Azalea fastigiata thrives in partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it a popular choice for garden borders and container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide year-round interest with its foliage and seasonal blooms."
