    "intro": "Aster calcareus, commonly known as the limestone aster, is a perennial herb native to dry, calcareous soils in North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, blue to violet flowers in the summer. Its flowering period usually occurs from July to September, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aster calcareus is valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
