    "intro": "Alnus japonica f. koreana, commonly known as Korean alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Korea and parts of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, such as nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria."
