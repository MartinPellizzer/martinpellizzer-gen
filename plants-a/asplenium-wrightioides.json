    "intro": "Asplenium wrightioides, commonly known as the Wright's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium wrightioides is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for moist, well-drained substrates."
