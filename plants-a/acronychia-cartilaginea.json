    "intro": "Acronychia cartilaginea, commonly known as the sandpaper fig, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, sandpaper-like bark, which gives it its common name. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.",
