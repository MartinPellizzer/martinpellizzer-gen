    "intro": "Auriculardisia pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's earleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
