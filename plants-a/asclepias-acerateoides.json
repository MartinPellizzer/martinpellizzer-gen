    "intro": "Asclepias acerateoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, hooded structures called corollas. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and is known for its milky sap, which contains cardiac glycosides. Asclepias acerateoides thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils."
