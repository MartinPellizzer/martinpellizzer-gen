    "intro": "Apatostelis crescentiicola, commonly known as the crescent-shaped leaf fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, crescent-shaped fronds that are often curled and compact. The plant has a delicate, wiry stem with small, clustered roots, and its leaves are typically a deep green color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
