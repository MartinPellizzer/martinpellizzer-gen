    "intro": "Acacia courtii, commonly known as the white acacia, is a small, deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often exuding a milky sap when wounded. Acacia courtii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with low rainfall.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia courtii is primarily native to New South Wales. It is commonly found in the dry grasslands and open woodlands of the state. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the semi-arid climate of the region. It is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Acacia courtii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia courtii was mainly introduced to regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low to moderate rainfall, making it suitable for dryland environments. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, which makes it valuable in reforestation projects. Its introduction has also been noted in parts of the Mediterranean and the Middle East due to its adaptability. However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native flora."
