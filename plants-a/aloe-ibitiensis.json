    "intro": "Aloe ibitiensis, commonly known as the Ibitiense Aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the rainy season. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine."
