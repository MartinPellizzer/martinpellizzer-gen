    "intro": "Acrostichum moritzianum var. erythrocomum, commonly known as the red-stemmed fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped, dark green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its unique red-tinged stems distinguish it from other varieties within the Acrostichum genus.",
