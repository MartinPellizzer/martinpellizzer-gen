It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikelets. It is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and small mammals. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions."
