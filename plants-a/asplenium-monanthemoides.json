    "intro": "Asplenium monanthemoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. This plant is native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors, where it can absorb moisture from the surrounding environment."
