    "intro": "Aloe pretoriensis, commonly known as the Pretoria aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with bright yellow flowers, often blooming in spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that has been used for its healing properties. Aloe pretoriensis is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy ornamental plant."
