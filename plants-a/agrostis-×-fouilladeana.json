    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 fouilladeana, commonly known as the hybrid meadowgrass, is a sterile, diploid hybrid species resulting from the cross between Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis stolonifera. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in temperate regions, particularly in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation for spread. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a model organism for studying hybridization and genetic diversity in grasses."
