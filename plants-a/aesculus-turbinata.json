The tree produces showy, white or pink flowers in upright clusters during the spring, followed by spiny, capsule-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grey, and it can grow up to 15 meters tall. Aesculus turbinata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
