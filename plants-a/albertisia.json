    "intro": "Albertisia, commonly known as the African daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plants typically have basal rosettes of narrow, linear leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Albertisia species are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. They are generally drought-tolerant and require well-drained soil to flourish."
