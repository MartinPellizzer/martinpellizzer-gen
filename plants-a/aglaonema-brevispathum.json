It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green veins contrasting against light green or white leaf blades. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves that are short and broad at the base. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires moderate humidity and well-draining soil. Aglaonema brevispathum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
