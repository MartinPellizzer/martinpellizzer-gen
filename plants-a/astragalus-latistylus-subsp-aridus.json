    "intro": "Astragalus latistylus subsp. aridus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in dry environments."
