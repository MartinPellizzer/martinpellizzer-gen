It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small yellow flower heads that appear in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. Canadian tarragon is often used in culinary applications, though it is less common than French tarragon."
