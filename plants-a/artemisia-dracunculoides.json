    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculoides, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
