    "intro": "Aporrhiza rugosa, commonly known as the rough seagrass, is a marine flowering plant found in tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It belongs to the family Zosteraceae and is characterized by its ribbon-like leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, horizontal stems that anchor it in sandy or muddy substrates. Its flowering structures are small and inconspicuous, typically occurring in clusters near the base of the leaves. Aporrhiza rugosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms."
