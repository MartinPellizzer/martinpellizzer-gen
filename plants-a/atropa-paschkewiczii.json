    "intro": "Atropa paschkewiczii, commonly known as the Paschkewicz's belladonna, is a rare and striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces toxic berries that contain tropane alkaloids, similar to other species in the Atropa genus. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its rarity and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
