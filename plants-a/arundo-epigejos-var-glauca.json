It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with a temperate climate."
