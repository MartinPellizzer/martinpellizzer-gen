    "intro": "Ampelocalamus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock reed, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Ampelocalamus saxatilis is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
