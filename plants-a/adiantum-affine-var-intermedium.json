    "intro": "Adiantum affine var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate maidenhair fern, is a delicate and graceful fern native to eastern North America. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
