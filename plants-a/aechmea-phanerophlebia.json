    "intro": "Aechmea phanerophlebia, commonly known as the showy pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for hydration. The plant produces vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences with showy, red or orange bracts. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and covered in fine trichomes, which help in water retention. Aechmea phanerophlebia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
