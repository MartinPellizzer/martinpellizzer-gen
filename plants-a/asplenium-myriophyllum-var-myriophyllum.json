    "intro": "Asplenium myriophyllum var. myriophyllum, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet forests. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are usually bright green and can be either evergreen or deciduous depending on the climate. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
