    "intro": "Acacia douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas acacia, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, feathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Acacia douglasii is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia douglasii is primarily native to the western United States, including parts of California, Oregon, and Washington. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, chaparral, and along streambanks. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often associated with disturbed sites and can be found in both coastal and inland regions. Acacia douglasii is an important component of the local flora in these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia douglasii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky soils. The plant is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It has also been introduced to other regions outside its native range, including parts of Australia and New Zealand. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
