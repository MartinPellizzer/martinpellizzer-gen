    "intro": "Anisodontea fruticosa, commonly known as the African candelabra, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring a branched structure with a distinctive candelabra-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming during the cooler months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a slightly rough texture, while its stems are woody and often covered in fine hairs. Anisodontea fruticosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
