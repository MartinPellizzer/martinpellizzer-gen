    "intro": "Aeranthes dentiens, commonly known as the toothed air plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are serrated or toothed, giving it its common name. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention. The flowers are typically pink or red and bloom from the center of the rosette, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds."
