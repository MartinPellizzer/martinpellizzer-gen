    "intro": "Agrostis setosa, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered with fine, hairy leaves. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis setosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes."
