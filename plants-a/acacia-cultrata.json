    "intro": "Acacia cultrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia cultrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cultrata is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the African continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cultrata was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its potential use in land rehabilitation. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, mine sites, and degraded soils. The plant is valued for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions. Its introduction has had both positive ecological and potential negative impacts depending on the environment."
