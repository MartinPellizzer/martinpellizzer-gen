    "intro": "Aspidium donianum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium donianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
