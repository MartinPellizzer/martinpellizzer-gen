It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that form a dense, sword-like shape. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
