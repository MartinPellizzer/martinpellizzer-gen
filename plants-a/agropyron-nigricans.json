    "intro": "Agropyron nigricans, commonly known as black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Agropyron nigricans is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage crop for livestock."
