    "intro": "Alsophila decrescens var. hirsutifolia, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a dense, hairy layer of remnants from its fronds. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The varietal name \"hirsutifolia\" refers to its distinctive hairy foliage, which sets it apart from other members of the Alsophila genus."
