It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, featuring deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
