    "intro": "Arnica rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, fleshy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant grows in rocky, alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and dry meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties."
