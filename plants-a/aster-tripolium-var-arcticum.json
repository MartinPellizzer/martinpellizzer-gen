It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to purple. The plant typically has narrow, hairy leaves and is adapted to survive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for pollinators in its ecosystem."
