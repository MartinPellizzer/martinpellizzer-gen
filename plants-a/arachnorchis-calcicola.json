    "intro": "Arachnorchis calcicola, commonly known as the limestone orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific calcareous habitats. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, often pale-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, adapting to nutrient-poor environments. Its structure includes a short rhizome with a few leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
