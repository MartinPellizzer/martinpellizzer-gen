    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum subsp. obtusum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as on rocks, walls, or in forest undergrowth. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of whitish spore-producing structures called sori. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
