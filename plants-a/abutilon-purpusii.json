    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon purpusii is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and the Greater Antilles. It is also found in parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern South America. This plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments, often near rivers or in coastal areas. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its native range is limited to these specific regions within the Neotropical region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon purpusii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant has become naturalized in several countries, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions contribute to its successful establishment. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its invasive tendencies."
