    "intro": "Athyrium spinosissimum, commonly known as the spiny wood fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are often covered in fine, spiny hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The spiny texture of its leaves is a distinguishing feature that helps in identifying the species."
