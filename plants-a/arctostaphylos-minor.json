    "intro": "Arctostaphylos minor, commonly known as the dwarf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Arctostaphylos minor is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
