    "intro": "Acosta zeybekii, commonly known as the Zeybekii lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires a cool, humid climate to thrive. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta zeybekii is considered a vulnerable species.",
