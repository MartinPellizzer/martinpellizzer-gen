    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. media, commonly known as intermediate oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201390 cm, with slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-rowed florets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
