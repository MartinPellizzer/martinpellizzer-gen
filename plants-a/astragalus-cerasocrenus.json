    "intro": "Astragalus cerasocrenus, commonly known as the redhead vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through mechanical means. This species is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
