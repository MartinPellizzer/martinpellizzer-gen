It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in rocky soils and dry environments, showcasing its adaptability to arid conditions. Its botanical features include hollow stems and a fibrous root system, which aid in water retention. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to cultivated wheat."
