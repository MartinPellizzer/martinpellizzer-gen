    "intro": "Astragalus schistosus, commonly known as the flaky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus schistosus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
