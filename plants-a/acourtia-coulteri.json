    "intro": "Acourtia coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by capsule fruits containing tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions.",
