    "intro": "Anthyllis polycephala var. gomarica, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces violet or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. This variety is often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
