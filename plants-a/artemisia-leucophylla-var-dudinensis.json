    "intro": "Artemisia leucophylla var. dudinensis, commonly known as the silverleaf artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming from late summer to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. Due to its aromatic properties and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in landscaping and traditional herbal practices."
