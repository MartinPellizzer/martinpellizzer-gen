    "intro": "Asplenium fragile, commonly known as the brittle spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often clustered in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium fragile is often found in temperate regions and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor environment."
