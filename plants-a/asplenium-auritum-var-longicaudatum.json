    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive elongated tail-like structure at the tip, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, silky-textured pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
