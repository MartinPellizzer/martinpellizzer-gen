    "intro": "Acacia porcata, commonly known as the porcupine acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, cylindrical stems that are covered in small, hooked thorns. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, which are often visited by birds and insects. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. Acacia porcata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia porcata is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the northern regions of the state, particularly in the wet tropical and subtropical areas. This plant thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is well adapted to the local climate and plays an important role in the ecosystem. Its distribution is largely restricted to Queensland, where it is a characteristic component of the native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia porcata was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has also been noted in some parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. However, it is important to monitor its spread due to potential impacts on native ecosystems."
