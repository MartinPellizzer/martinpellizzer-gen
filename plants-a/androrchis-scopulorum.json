It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, fragrant orchid flowers in shades of white, yellow, and green. Its flowers are characterized by a long, slender spur that extends from the base of the flower. Androrchis scopulorum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in areas with limited soil and high exposure to wind and sun."
