    "intro": "Apostasia platystylis, commonly known as the broad-styled marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces a single, erect stem with a few leaves and a cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in waterlogged environments. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in coastal regions."
