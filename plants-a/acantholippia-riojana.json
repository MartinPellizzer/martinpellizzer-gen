    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholippia riojana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru. It is commonly found in the high-altitude zones of the Andes, typically between 2,000 and 4,000 meters above sea level. This plant thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with alpine environments. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholippia riojana was mainly introduced to areas with suitable Mediterranean climates, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and foothills. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and other Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to other invasive species."
