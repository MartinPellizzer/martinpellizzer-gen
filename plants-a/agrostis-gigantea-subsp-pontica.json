    "intro": "Agrostis gigantea subsp. pontica, commonly known as Pontic quackgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands."
