    "intro": "Adelmeria pinetorum, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and deep green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by spherical, greenish-brown fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Adelmeria pinetorum plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species.",
