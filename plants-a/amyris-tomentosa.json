It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which is covered in a dense, woolly coating of fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exuding a resinous scent. Amyris tomentosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
