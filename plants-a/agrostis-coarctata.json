    "intro": "Agrostis coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often less than 10 millimeters wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, flowering structures typical of the grass family. Agrostis coarctata is often used in horticulture for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its dense growth habit."
