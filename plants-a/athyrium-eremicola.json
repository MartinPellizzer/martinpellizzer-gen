    "intro": "Athyrium eremicola, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a species native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the fern family. Athyrium eremicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
