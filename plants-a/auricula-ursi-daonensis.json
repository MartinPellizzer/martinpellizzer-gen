    "intro": "Auricula-ursi daonensis, commonly known as the Daonensis bear's ear, is a rare alpine plant native to specific regions in China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
