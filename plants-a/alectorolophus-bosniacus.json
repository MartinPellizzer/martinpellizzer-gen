    "intro": "Alectorolophus bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a composite organism formed by a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium. This lichen typically grows on bark, stone, or soil in temperate and boreal forest regions. It is characterized by its pale green to yellowish thallus and lacks distinct lobes or cracks. Alectorolophus bosniacus is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
