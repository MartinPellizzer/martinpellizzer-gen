    "intro": "Avena montana subvar. glaucophylla, commonly known as the blue-leafed oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its glaucous (bluish-gray) foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in dry regions."
