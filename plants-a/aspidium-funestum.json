    "intro": "Aspidium funestum, commonly known as the black spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or trees in humid environments. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with simple, linear leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores that are dispersed by wind. Aspidium funestum is often found in shaded, moist areas and is considered a characteristic species of certain forest ecosystems."
