    "intro": "Anthericum liliago var. subramosum, commonly known as the fragrant lily of the valley, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous root system, and its most distinctive characteristic is its clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. The plant produces showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in early spring, often preceding the emergence of leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and historical use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
