    "intro": "Agropyron teslinense, commonly known as Teslin bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with narrow, blue-green leaves that form dense, mat-like growth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Agropyron teslinense plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for local wildlife in its harsh native environment."
