    "intro": "Andropogon zizanioides var. nigritanus, commonly known as black bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, coarse leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to form dense stands, making it both a valuable forage plant and a potential weed."
