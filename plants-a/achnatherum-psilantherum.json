It is a perennial plant characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is closely related to other wild oat species.",
