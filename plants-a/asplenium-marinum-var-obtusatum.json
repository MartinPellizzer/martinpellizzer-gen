    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. obtusatum, commonly known as the coastal spleenwort, is a fern native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and is adapted to salt spray and tidal influences. The plant has lance-shaped, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming dense, low-growing rosettes. Its fronds are typically short and have a distinctive, narrow shape with a serrated edge. This variety is closely related to other asplenium species and is often found in association with other halophytic plants in coastal ecosystems."
