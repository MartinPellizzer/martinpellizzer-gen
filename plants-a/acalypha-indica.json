It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist environments such as forests, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its adaptability to various soil types and can thrive in both coastal and inland areas. It is widely distributed across South and Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Indian Ocean islands. Its native range reflects its ability to colonize diverse habitats across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha indica was mainly introduced to Caroline Is., Chagos Archipelago, Christmas I., Cocos (Keeling) Is., Comoros, Cuba, Leeward Is., Madagascar, Marianas, Mauritius, Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, Puerto Rico, R\u00e9union, Samoa, Seychelles, Tokelau-Manihiki, and Windward Is. It is commonly found in coastal and disturbed areas, often growing in sandy soils. The plant is known for its ornamental value and has been cultivated for its colorful foliage. It has become naturalized in many of these regions, sometimes forming dense stands. Its introduction is likely due to human activities such as horticulture and accidental seed dispersal."
