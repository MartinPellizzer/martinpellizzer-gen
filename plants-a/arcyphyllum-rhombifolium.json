    "intro": "Arcyphyllum rhombifolium, commonly known as mountain sage or desert sage, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green leaves that are rhombic in shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Arcyphyllum rhombifolium is well adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, desert-like climates."
