    "intro": "Abies vulgaris, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its dense, dark green foliage that is often covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that hang from the branches, containing seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is typically gray to brown, becoming furrowed with age, and its roots are deep and extensive, helping to stabilize soil in its native habitat. The white fir is valued for its timber and is also a popular ornamental plant in gardens and parks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies vulgaris is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is commonly found in the Carpathian Mountains, the Alps, and the Caucasus region. This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It is often associated with mixed forests and can be found at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Due to its hardy nature, it has adapted to a variety of environmental conditions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies vulgaris was mainly introduced to North America during the 19th century as part of ornamental horticulture. It was cultivated for its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its rapid growth rate. Conservation efforts are now underway to control its expansion and protect local ecosystems."
