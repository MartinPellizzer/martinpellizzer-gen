    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum f. pallidus, commonly known as the pale sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its pale green foliage and reduced flowering structures. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, elongated leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle, which is often less dense and more open compared to other sorghum varieties. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in marginal soils."
