It is commonly found in the southern regions, including the Marlborough and Otago areas. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena saccaticupula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is now considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit. Its distribution is primarily confined to the northern and central parts of New Zealand."
