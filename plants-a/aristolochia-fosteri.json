    "intro": "Aristolochia fosteri, commonly known as Foster's Dutchman's pipe, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and the Caribbean. Its flowers emit a strong, sometimes foul odor to attract specific pollinators like flies. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
