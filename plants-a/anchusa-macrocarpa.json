It features robust, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces showy, tubular blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Anchusa macrocarpa is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
