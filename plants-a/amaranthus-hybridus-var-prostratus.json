    "intro": "Amaranthus hybridus var. prostratus, commonly known as prostrate amaranth, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas. It features succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces dense clusters of small, green to red bracts that surround the flowering spikes. Its leaves are typically oval or lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Prostrate amaranth is often cultivated as a ornamental plant or used in erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
