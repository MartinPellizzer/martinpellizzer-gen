    "intro": "Argemone corymbosa var. arenicola, commonly known as the coastal argemone, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its seeds are encased in a thick, fleshy capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature. This species is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought and salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments."
