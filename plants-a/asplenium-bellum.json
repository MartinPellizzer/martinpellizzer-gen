    "intro": "Asplenium bellum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, bright green, velvety fronds that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium bellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
