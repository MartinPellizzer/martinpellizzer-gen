    "intro": "Acacia flexifolia, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its drooping branches and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. Acacia flexifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia flexifolia is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. This species is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in low-nutrient environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flexifolia was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it suitable for landscaping and afforestation efforts. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
