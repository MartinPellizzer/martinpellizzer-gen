    "intro": "Agave scolymus var. polymorpha, commonly known as the Variegated Century Plant, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow variegation. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny margins and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers, which appear after several years. This plant is well-suited for arid climates and requires minimal water once established."
