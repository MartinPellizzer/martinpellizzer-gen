    "intro": "Angraecum acutipetalum, commonly known as the sharp-petaled angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with intricate, spurred petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts in controlled greenhouse conditions."
