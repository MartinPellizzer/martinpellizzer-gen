It is characterized by its densely packed, scaly leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stems and release spores when mature. Araiostegia squamata plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitat for various invertebrates."
