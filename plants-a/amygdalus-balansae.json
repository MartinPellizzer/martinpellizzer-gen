    "intro": "Amygdalus balansae, commonly known as the Balansae almond, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a hairy husk, similar to other members of the Prunus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
