    "intro": "Axonopus compressus subsp. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed matgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth surface and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
