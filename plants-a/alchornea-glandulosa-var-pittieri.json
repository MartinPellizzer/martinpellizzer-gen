    "intro": "Alchornea glandulosa var. pittieri, commonly known as the Mexican red mangrove, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its reddish-brown bark and succulent, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in brackish or saltwater habitats, often forming dense thickets in mangrove ecosystems. Its adaptability to high salinity and periodic flooding makes it an important species for coastal stabilization and biodiversity."
