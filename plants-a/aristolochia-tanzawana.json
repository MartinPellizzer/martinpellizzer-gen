    "intro": "Aristolochia tanzawana, commonly known as Tanzanian birthwort, is a climbing vine native to East Africa. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and unique, hollow, pipe-like flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often covered in a dense, velvety hair. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in folk medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, like many members of its genus, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution."
