    "intro": "Auricula glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky auricula, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy, violet to blue flowers with a distinctive sticky secretion on the petals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The sticky substance on its petals is believed to aid in pollination by attracting specific insect species."
