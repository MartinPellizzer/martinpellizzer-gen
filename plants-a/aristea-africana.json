    "intro": "Aristea africana, commonly known as the African carpetweed, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
