    "intro": "Aspidium biolleyi, commonly known as the Boll\u00e9's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant exhibits a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium biolleyi is often found in slow-moving or still water bodies, where it contributes to aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
