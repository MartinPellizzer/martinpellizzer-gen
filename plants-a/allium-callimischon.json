    "intro": "Allium callimischon, commonly known as the Turk's turban, is a bulbous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features a large, spherical bulb and produces clusters of pale purple to lilac flowers with a distinctive, rounded shape. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. The flowers are also used in some traditional cuisines, though they are not as commonly consumed as other allium species."
