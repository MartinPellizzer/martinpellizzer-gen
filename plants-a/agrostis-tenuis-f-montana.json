It is a low-growing, perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like growth. This plant is characterized by its fine, narrow leaves and compact inflorescence, which consists of small spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
