    "intro": "Acosta peucedanifolia, commonly known as the Andean angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, black, oily seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling as it contains toxic compounds.",
