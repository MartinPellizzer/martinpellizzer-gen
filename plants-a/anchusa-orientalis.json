    "intro": "Anchusa orientalis, commonly known as the oriental bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in dry conditions once established."
