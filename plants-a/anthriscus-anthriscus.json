    "intro": "Anthriscus anthriscus, commonly known as hedge parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of parsley, and it produces small, white to greenish flowers in umbel-like clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 100 centimeters and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine and culinary applications."
