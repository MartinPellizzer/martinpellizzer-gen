    "intro": "Anatherum zizanioides, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass native to wetland environments in North America. It has slender, cylindrical stems that grow from rhizomes and often form dense mats in shallow water or moist soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 mm wide. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Anatherum zizanioides plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates and birds."
