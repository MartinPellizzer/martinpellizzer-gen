    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris, commonly known as mugwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Mugwort is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. It has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a component in herbal remedies."
