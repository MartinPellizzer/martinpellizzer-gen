    "intro": "Asplenium rutifolium var. prolongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf spleenwort, is a fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded areas, often found in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside. This variant is distinguished by its longer leaf blades compared to the typical form of Asplenium rutifolium."
