It is characterized by its unique, saddle-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its fruit is a distinctive bladder-like capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
