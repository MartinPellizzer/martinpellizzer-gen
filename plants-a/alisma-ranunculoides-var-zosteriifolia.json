    "intro": "Alisma ranunculoides var. zosteriifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette, with a distinctive narrow, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically emerging from the water's surface. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
