    "intro": "Actinidia longicauda, commonly known as the hairy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three to five lobes and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a bright red or orange color in the fall. These berries are often used in jams and wines due to their high acidity and unique flavor. Actinidia longicauda is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens.",
