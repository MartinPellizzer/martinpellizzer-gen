    "intro": "Asclepias mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, orange-tipped clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
