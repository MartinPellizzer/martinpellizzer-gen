    "intro": "Alsophila blechnoides var. polycarpa, commonly known as the polycarpic hakea, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature in ferns. This variety is noted for its unique reproductive traits, including the production of multiple sporangia on each sorus."
