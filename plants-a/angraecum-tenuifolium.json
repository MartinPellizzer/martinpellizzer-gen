    "intro": "Angraecum tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It features long, narrow leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale green flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots are specialized to absorb moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. Angraecum tenuifolium is prized in horticulture for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation under proper conditions."
