    "intro": "Aspalathus nervosa, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its most notable feature is its unique, fine, red-brown foliage, which is used to make the popular herbal tea known as rooibos. Aspalathus nervosa thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region."
