    "intro": "Angraecum laciniatum, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid or the lace orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and large, pendant flowers with intricate, lace-like patterns on the petals. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Angraecum laciniatum is known for its slow growth and requires specific care to thrive in cultivation."
