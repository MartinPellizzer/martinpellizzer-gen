    "intro": "Acaena trifida var. nanodes, commonly known as the small-flowered New Zealand burr, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant produces numerous spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its foliage consists of alternate, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. nanodes is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and forest margins. The variety is known for its small, spiny fruits and is part of the bramble family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. nanodes was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes or as a contaminant in agricultural products. It has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
