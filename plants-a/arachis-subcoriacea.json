    "intro": "Arachis subcoriacea, commonly known as rough peanutgrass, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible pods containing seeds that are similar to peanuts but less commonly cultivated. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
