    "intro": "Antirrhinum orontium subsp. microcarpum, commonly known as the narrowleaf toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
