    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa var. undulata, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a variant of the showy milkweed native to North America. It is characterized by its undulating, zigzag-shaped stems and vibrant orange flowers. The plant produces intricate, pod-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. This species is important for supporting monarch butterfly populations, as it serves as a host plant for their larvae."
