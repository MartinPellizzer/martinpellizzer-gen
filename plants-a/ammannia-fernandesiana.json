    "intro": "Ammannia fernandesiana, commonly known as the Cape Verde fern, is a rare and endemic fern species native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores dispersed by wind. Due to its limited habitat and threats from environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
