    "intro": "Asparagus madecassus var. montanus, commonly known as mountain asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features wiry, spiny stems and small, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
