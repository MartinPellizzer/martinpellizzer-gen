    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. leucantha, commonly known as white agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. White agrimony is known for its aromatic properties and has been used historically in herbal medicine. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
