    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. patula, commonly known as the cushion arabis, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
