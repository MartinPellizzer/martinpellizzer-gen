    "intro": "Alsophila holstii, commonly known as the Holst's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that can reach several meters in height, giving it a lush, tropical appearance. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of the fronds and contributing to its structural stability. Alsophila holstii is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
