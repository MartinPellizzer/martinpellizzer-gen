    "intro": "Asclepias insignis, commonly known as the Desert Milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, woolly leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Asclepias insignis is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
