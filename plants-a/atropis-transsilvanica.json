    "intro": "Atropis transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
