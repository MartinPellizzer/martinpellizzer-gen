    "intro": "Acacia lenticularis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging branches and bipinnate leaves that are narrow and feather-like. The plant produces yellow floral spikes during the spring and summer months, which are composed of numerous small, pea-like flowers. Acacia lenticularis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance and a deep root system. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lenticularis is primarily native to the arid regions of Australia, particularly in the states of Western Australia and South Australia. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in inland areas with low rainfall. This species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It is often seen in spinifex plains and open woodlands. Acacia lenticularis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lenticularis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and mountainous areas. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and has shown resilience in both sandy and rocky soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural habitats, sometimes competing with native vegetation. Despite its invasive potential in some areas, it is also valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
