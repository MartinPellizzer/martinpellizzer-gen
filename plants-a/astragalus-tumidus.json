    "intro": "Astragalus tumidus, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces inflated pods that contain seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal. Astragalus tumidus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
