    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. pseudarmeriastrum, commonly known as coastal sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds via wind."
