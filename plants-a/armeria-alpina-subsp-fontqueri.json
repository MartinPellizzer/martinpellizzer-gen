    "intro": "Armeria alpina subsp. fontqueri, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with basal leaves that are linear and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
