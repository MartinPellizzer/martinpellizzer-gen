    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum f. prostrata, commonly known as creeping alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness. Its botanical name reflects its origin and the prostrate form of its growth."
