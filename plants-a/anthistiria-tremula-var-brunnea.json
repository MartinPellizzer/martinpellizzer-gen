    "intro": "Anthistiria tremula var. brunnea, commonly known as the brown willow, is a variant of the trembling willow characterized by its dark brown bark and slender, drooping branches. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest edges. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy underside, and they turn yellow in the fall. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in the spring, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
