It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces a large, smooth-skinned fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The fruit is typically eaten fresh or used in culinary applications due to its sweet, juicy pulp. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist lowland forests."
