It is found in the eastern and western regions of the country, including the coastal areas and the interior grasslands. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and along the edges of forests. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The variety is known for its distinctive appearance and is often used in local landscapes for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mollissima var. stenoloba was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas of southern Australia. It is often used for erosion control and as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological and agricultural benefits in its new habitats."
