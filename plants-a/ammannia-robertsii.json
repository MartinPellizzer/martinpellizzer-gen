    "intro": "Ammannia robertsii, commonly known as the redroot ammannia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and bright red stems that contrast with its small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Ammannia robertsii thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its vivid coloration and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
