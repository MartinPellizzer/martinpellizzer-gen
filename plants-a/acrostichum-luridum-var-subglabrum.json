    "intro": "Acrostichum luridum var. subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth fronded brake fern, is a variant of the brake fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are smooth to the touch, lacking the hairy texture found in other varieties. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal.",
