    "intro": "Astragalus viciiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus viciiformis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve nitrogen content."
