    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides var. muricata, commonly known as the rough spike wheat, is a wild relative of cultivated wheat species. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough, and bristly awns that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is native to regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It has a diploid genome and is closely related to the genus Triticum. This species is of interest in plant breeding for its potential to contribute beneficial traits to wheat, such as disease resistance and stress tolerance."
