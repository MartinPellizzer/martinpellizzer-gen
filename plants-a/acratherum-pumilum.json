    "intro": "Acratherum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf acanthus, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, spathaceous inflorescences with showy, violet-blue bracts that resemble flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping.",
