It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Anisomeris ribesioides is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
