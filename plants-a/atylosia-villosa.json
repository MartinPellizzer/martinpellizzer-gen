    "intro": "Atylosia villosa, commonly known as the hairy lomatium, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the carrot family. Atylosia villosa is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments."
