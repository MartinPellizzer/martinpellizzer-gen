    "intro": "Acaena inermis, commonly known as New Zealand spinach, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, green, edible leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into spherical, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal areas and forest margins. Acaena inermis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary use in certain regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena inermis is primarily native to New Zealand North and New Zealand South. This plant is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, forest margins, and rocky areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is well adapted to the local environmental conditions. The species plays an important role in the ecological balance of these regions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the islands of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena inermis was mainly introduced to Great Britain as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, spiny foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought in during the 19th or early 20th century as part of the broader trend of introducing exotic plant species for garden and landscape use. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can spread rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water. Its introduction highlights the potential ecological risks associated with non-native plant species."
