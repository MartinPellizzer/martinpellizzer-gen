    "intro": "Andropogon australis var. timorensis, commonly known as Timor grass, is a perennial grass native to the island of Timor. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and smooth. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense spikelets, which are clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open grasslands or disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a potential resource for ecological restoration projects."
