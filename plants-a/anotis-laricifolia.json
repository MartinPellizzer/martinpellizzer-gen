    "intro": "Anotis laricifolia, commonly known as the mountain pepper or mountain thyme, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. Anotis laricifolia thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
