    "intro": "Astragalus plumosus subsp. nitens, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, yellowish to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
