    "intro": "Armeria bourgaei subsp. lanceobracteata, commonly known as the lance-bract edgeworthia, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, characterized by its succulent leaves and showy flowers. The plant features dense, compact growth with narrow, lance-shaped bracts that enclose its small, star-shaped flowers. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
