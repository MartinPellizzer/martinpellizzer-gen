    "intro": "Anemia caudata var. abscissa, commonly known as the cut-leaved anemia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive notched or cut appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
