    "intro": "Astragalus palenae var. palenae, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. Astragalus palenae var. palenae is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
