    "intro": "Andropogon plumbeus, commonly known as blue bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in prairie habitats and is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils. It plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting native wildlife. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in disturbed areas make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects."
