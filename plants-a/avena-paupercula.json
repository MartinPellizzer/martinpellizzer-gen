    "intro": "Avena paupercula, commonly known as the poor grass, is a small annual grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, erect stems and small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each containing several tiny flowers. Avena paupercula is adapted to arid environments and has a short growing season, making it a resilient but less conspicuous member of the grass family."
