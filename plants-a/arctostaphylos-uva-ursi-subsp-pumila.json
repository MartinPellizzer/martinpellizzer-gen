    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. pumila, commonly known as dwarf bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
