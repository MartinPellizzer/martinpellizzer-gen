    "intro": "Arthropogon scaber, commonly known as rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green blades that are typically rough to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Arthropogon scaber is valued for its erosion control capabilities and as a forage plant for livestock."
