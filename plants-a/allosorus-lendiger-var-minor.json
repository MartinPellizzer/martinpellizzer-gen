    "intro": "Allosorus lendiger var. minor, commonly known as the small alpine saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Saxifragaceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adaptations to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in alpine ecosystems."
