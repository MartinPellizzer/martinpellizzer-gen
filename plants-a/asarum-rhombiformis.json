It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, rhomboid leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a distinctive, tubular, greenish-yellow flower that resembles a horn, which is typical of the genus Asarum. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
