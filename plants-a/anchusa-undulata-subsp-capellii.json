    "intro": "Anchusa undulata subsp. capellii, commonly known as the Cape bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
