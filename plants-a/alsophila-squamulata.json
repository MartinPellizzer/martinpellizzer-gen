    "intro": "Alsophila squamulata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and fronds that are covered in a silvery, scaly appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Alsophila squamulata plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
