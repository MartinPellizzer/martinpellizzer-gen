    "intro": "Asplenium pinnatifidum var. kentuckiense, commonly known as the Kentucky spleenwort, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a finely divided appearance. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in crevices, thriving in humid, temperate environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The species is relatively small, with fronds reaching up to 20 centimeters in length, making it a subtle yet distinctive member of the fern flora."
