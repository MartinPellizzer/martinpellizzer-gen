    "intro": "Arcytophyllum bryoides, commonly known as the mossy sage, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Arcytophyllum bryoides is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in extreme desert conditions."
