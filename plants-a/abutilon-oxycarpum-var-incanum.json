This variety is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. Its native distribution is largely restricted to specific areas within South Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum var. incanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It has been found growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. The plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It was likely introduced through human activities, such as landscaping or accidental seed dispersal. Its distribution has expanded in recent years, raising concerns among local conservationists."
