    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Americas. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent and have been used in traditional medicine."
