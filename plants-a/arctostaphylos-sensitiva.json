    "intro": "Arctostaphylos sensitiva, commonly known as the sensitive manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, evergreen leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Arctostaphylos sensitiva is known for its sensitivity to environmental changes, which is reflected in its common name."
