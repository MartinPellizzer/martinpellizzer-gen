    "intro": "Arthrocereus mirabilis, commonly known as the star cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom at night. The plant has a nocturnal blooming habit, which is an adaptation to its arid environment and pollination by nocturnal insects. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. Arthrocereus mirabilis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and striking floral display."
