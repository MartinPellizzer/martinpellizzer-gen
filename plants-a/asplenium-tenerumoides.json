    "intro": "Asplenium tenerumoides, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, delicate fern characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its leaves are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Asplenium tenerumoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
