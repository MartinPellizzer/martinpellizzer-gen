    "intro": "Aspidopterys thorelii, commonly known as the Thorelli's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaceae. It attaches itself to the branches of its host trees, such as those in the genus *Ficus*, through a specialized root system called haustoria. The plant derives some of its nutrients from the host but also performs photosynthesis using its leaves. It produces small, white or yellowish berries that are dispersed by birds. Aspidopterys thorelii is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in humid, shaded environments."
