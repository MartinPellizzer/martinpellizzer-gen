    "intro": "Aloe depressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, narrow, and often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the warmer months. Aloe depressa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive drought conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
