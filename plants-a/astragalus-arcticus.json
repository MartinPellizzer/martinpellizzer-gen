    "intro": "Astragalus arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has slender stems and small, compound leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and rocky areas. Astragalus arcticus is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in full sun conditions."
