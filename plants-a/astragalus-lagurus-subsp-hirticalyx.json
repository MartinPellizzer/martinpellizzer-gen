    "intro": "Astragalus lagurus subsp. hirticalyx, commonly known as the hairyleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy leaves, which give it its common name and aid in reducing water loss in dry environments. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert steppe habitats. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and is also of interest for its potential medicinal properties."
