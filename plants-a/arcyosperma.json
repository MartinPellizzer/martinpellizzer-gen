    "intro": "Arcyosperma, commonly known as the flame tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange floral bracts that resemble flames, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Arcyosperma species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce fruits that are capsule-like in structure. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral display."
