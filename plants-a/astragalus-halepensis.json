    "intro": "Astragalus halepensis, commonly known as goat's horn, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its unique, horn-like seed pods. Astragalus halepensis is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration efforts."
