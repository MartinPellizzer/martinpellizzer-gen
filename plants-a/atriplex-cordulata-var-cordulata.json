    "intro": "Atriplex cordulata var. cordulata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and thrive in harsh conditions."
