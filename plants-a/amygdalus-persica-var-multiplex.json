    "intro": "Amygdalus persica var. multiplex, commonly known as the multi-flowered peach. This variant is a cultivar of the peach tree, characterized by its production of multiple flowers per cluster, which can enhance its ornamental value. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree with a spreading habit and smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin, while the flowers are pinkish-white with a subtle fragrance. The fruit, although less prominent than in standard peaches, can be edible and often has a sweeter flavor."
