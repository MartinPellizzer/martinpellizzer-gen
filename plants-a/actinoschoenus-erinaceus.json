    "intro": "Actinoschoenus erinaceus, commonly known as the hairy bladdergrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in arid environments. Actinoschoenus erinaceus is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",
