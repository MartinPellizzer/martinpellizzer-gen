    "intro": "Asperula tinctoria subsp. hungarorum, commonly known as Hungarian alpine azalea, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
