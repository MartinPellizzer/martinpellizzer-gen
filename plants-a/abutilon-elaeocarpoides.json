It is commonly found in the states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Paran\u00e1, and Santa Catarina. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forest understories. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays an important ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon elaeocarpoides was mainly introduced to coastal and disturbed areas in the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in wetlands, dunes, and roadsides. The plant is known for its distinctive fuzzy leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
