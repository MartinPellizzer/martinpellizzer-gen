It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and lanceolate, willow-like leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study.",
