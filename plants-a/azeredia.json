    "intro": "Azeredia, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive seed heads that disperse via the wind. Azeredia is often found in rocky soils and dry grasslands, thriving in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive plant for xeriscaping and native gardens."
