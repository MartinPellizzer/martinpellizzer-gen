    "intro": "Araucaria beccarii, commonly known as the Antarctic pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its slender, tall trunk and distinctive, drooping branches that give it a unique, pine-like appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically yellow or brown, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. Its needles are long, thin, and slightly curved, with a dark green color and a waxy coating. Araucaria beccarii is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates."
