    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. subrepens, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-hued leaves and produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. This variety is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
