    "intro": "Athyrium halleri, commonly known as the Haller's wood fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Athyrium halleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
