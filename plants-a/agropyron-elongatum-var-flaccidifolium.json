It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and have a soft, feathery texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens and restoration projects."
