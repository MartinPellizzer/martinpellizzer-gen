    "intro": "Agave quadrata, commonly known as the Quadrata Agave, is a species of agave native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers, which appear after the plant has matured. Agave quadrata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a favored plant in arid landscapes."
