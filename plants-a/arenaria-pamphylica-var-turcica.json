    "intro": "Arenaria pamphylica var. turcica, commonly known as Turkish sandpink, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of Turkey and the Balkans. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
