    "intro": "Aspidium medium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground, forming dense colonies. Aspidium medium plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
