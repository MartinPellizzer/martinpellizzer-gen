    "intro": "Artemisia alba subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, particularly camphor and thujone, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and ceremonial practices."
