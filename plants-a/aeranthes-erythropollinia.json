    "intro": "Aeranthes erythropollinia, commonly known as the red-pollinated orchid, is a species native to the wet tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that display a range of vibrant colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
