    "intro": "Acalypha communis var. hirtiformis, commonly known as the hairy ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. hirtiformis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This variant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. It is also known to occur in parts of the Philippines and some regions of southern China. The plant is well adapted to warm climates and is often part of the understory vegetation in tropical forests.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha communis var. hirtiformis was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in non-native regions. Due to its ornamental value, it has been widely cultivated, leading to its establishment in several regions outside its native range."
