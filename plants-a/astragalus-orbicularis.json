    "intro": "Astragalus orbicularis, commonly known as the roundleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its orbicular (rounded) leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in harsh environments. Astragalus orbicularis is also known for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
