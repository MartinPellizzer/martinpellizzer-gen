    "intro": "Asplenium striatum var. tripinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and ornamental fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a distinctive narrow, linear shape and a pale green to silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other ferns. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care in humid conditions."
