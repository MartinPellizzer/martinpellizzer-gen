    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions makes it a common weed in agricultural areas."
