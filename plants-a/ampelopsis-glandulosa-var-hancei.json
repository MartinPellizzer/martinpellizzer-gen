    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa var. hancei, commonly known as the Chinese bittersweet, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that give way to orange-red berries in the fall. Its stems are woody and can reach lengths of several meters, making it suitable for trellises or arbors. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover structures."
