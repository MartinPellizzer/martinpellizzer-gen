    "intro": "Atractocarpus pseudoterminalis, commonly known as the false terminalia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and cinnamon trees. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single seed, and it often grows in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
