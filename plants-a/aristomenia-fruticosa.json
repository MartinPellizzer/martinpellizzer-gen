    "intro": "Aristomenia fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a thick layer of bark. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. Aristomenia fruticosa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, arid environments."
