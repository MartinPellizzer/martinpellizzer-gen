    "intro": "Agrostis aequivalvis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
