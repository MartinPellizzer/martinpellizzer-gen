It features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in bogs and marshes. Arthrochilium palustre is a rare and specialized species, indicating the health of its unique wetland ecosystem."
