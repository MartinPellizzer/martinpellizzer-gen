    "intro": "Apostasia shenzhenica, commonly known as the Shenzhen ghost orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to southern China. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white flowers. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a short, fleshy rhizome and narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms in late winter to early spring, producing clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are highly sought after by botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
