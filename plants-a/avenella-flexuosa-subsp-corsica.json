It typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are slightly folded and may have a bluish-gray appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
