    "intro": "Astragalus tatsienensis f. elongatus, commonly known as the elongated milkvetch, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellowish to reddish flowers in early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
