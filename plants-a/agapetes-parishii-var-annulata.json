    "intro": "Agapetes parishii var. annulata, commonly known as the annulated silverleaf, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
