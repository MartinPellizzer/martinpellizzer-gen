    "intro": "Alnus arguta var. punctata, commonly known as the punctate alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and small, cone-like fruits that contain edible seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and moist forests. It has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. The bark is typically smooth and grayish-brown, with some varieties showing distinctive white spots or markings."
