    "intro": "Aponogeton elongatus subsp. elongatus, commonly known as the slender water arrowhead, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that float on the water's surface, with long, slender stems that often root in the substrate. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically borne on stalks above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in aquatic gardens and artificial water features."
