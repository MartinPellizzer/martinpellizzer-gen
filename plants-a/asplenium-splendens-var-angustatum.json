    "intro": "Asplenium splendens var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its slender, dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are typically shorter than those of the standard variety. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, humid areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
