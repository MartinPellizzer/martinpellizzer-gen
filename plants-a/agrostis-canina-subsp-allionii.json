    "intro": "Agrostis canina subsp. allionii, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 5 mm wide. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
