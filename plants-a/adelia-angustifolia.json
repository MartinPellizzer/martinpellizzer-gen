    "intro": "Adelia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved adelia, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects.",
