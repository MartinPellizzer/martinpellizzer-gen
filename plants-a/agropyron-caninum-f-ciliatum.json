    "intro": "Agropyron caninum f. ciliatum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with fine, silky hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
