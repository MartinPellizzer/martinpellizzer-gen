    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria var. euxina, commonly known as the crimson everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy, bright red or orange-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, composite flower heads that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The species is also noted for its historical use in dye production and as a source of essential oils."
