    "intro": "Artemisia basilica, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features silvery-gray, aromatic foliage with finely divided leaves that emit a distinctive, somewhat camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Despite its ornamental value, it has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a source of the active ingredient in certain medicinal preparations."
