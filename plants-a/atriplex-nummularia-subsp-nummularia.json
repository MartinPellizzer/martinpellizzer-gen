    "intro": "Atriplex nummularia subsp. nummularia, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which consists of small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity. Atriplex nummularia subsp. nummularia is often used in xeriscaping and for stabilizing sandy or disturbed soils."
