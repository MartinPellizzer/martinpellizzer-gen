    "intro": "Agropyron biflorum subsp. andinum, commonly known as the Andean needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces spikelets that are often clustered in pairs. The plant typically thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing mountainous terrains and its potential for use in restoration projects."
