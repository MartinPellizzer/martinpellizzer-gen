It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers with prominent, showy bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Albuca chlorantha is relatively low maintenance and drought tolerant once established."
