It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by oval, woody fruits that are distinctive in appearance. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This subspecies is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
