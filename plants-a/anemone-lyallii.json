    "intro": "Anemone lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's anemone, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, petal-like bracts and a central cluster of small, true flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Anemone lyallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
