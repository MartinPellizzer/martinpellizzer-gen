    "intro": "Acetosella natans, commonly known as floating sorrel, is a small, herbaceous plant that thrives in wet or aquatic environments. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate leaves that often remain buoyant on the surface of water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it a common sight in marshes and ponds. Acetosella natans is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.",
