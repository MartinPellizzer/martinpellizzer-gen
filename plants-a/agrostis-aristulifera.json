    "intro": "Agrostis aristulifera, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Agrostis aristulifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
