It is commonly found in regions such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is known for its hairy stems and showy flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its native range includes a variety of habitats, including forests, scrublands, and open fields.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon frutescens was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it thrives as an ornamental plant. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of the southern United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The plant is valued for its attractive foliage and showy flowers, which make it popular in gardens and landscapes. It has been introduced to various locations for horticultural purposes, often as a decorative shrub or for erosion control. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and requiring management to prevent its spread."
