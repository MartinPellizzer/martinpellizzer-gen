    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. gaudichaudii is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other parts of Oceania. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests, where it thrives in humid and tropical climates. It is often associated with sandy soils and is well adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its native range. The species is also known to grow in disturbed habitats such as along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific island groups, reflecting its adaptation to these isolated ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. gaudichaudii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The distribution of this variant is limited to specific regions within New Zealand. It is commonly found in the North Island, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. Despite its introduction, it has not become naturalized beyond these localized habitats."
