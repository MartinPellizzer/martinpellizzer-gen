    "intro": "Aspidosperma melanocalyx, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in some areas."
