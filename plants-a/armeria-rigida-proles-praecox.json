    "intro": "Armeria rigida proles praecox, commonly known as the early flowering sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom early in the growing season. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
