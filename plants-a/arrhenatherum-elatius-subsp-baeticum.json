It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant has slender, erect culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, two-lipped spikelets. This subspecies is notable for its ecological significance in supporting local biodiversity and its role in traditional pastoral systems."
