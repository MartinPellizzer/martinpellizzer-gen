It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to thrive in cool, rocky environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This plant is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
