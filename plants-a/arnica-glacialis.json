    "intro": "Arnica glacialis, commonly known as glacier arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor firmly in nutrient-poor soils. Arnica glacialis is valued for its medicinal properties, particularly for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic compounds."
