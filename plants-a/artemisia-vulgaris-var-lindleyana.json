    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. lindleyana, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-green foliage and a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its small yellowish-green flowers are borne in clusters and bloom in late summer. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
