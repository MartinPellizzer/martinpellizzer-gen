    "intro": "Astragalus troglodytus, commonly known as the cave milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in crevices and on slopes. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus troglodytus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitats."
