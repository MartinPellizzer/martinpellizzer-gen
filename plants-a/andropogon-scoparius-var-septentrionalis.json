    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius var. septentrionalis, commonly known as northern switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. This variety thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well-suited for prairie ecosystems and restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which help prevent soil erosion. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds, aiding in its natural dispersal."
