    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 rehmannii, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces spiky, brown burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. Botanically, it belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles."
