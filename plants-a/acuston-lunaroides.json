    "intro": "Acuston lunaroides, commonly known as the Moonshade Vine, is a unique flowering plant characterized by its bioluminescent leaves and night-blooming flowers. Native to the dense, humid forests of the Andes, it thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its leaves emit a faint blue glow under moonlight, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. The plant has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from poor soil conditions. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation priority in its native habitat.",
