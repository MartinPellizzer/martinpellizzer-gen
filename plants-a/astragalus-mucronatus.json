    "intro": "Astragalus mucronatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus mucronatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
