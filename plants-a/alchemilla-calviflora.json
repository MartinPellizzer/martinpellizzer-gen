    "intro": "Alchemilla calviflora, commonly known as the lesser lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of silky white hairs, giving them a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters atop slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks. Alchemilla calviflora is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators."
