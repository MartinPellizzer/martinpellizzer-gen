    "intro": "Anthurium undulifolium, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety coating of fine hairs. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the actual flowers. Its foliage is typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Anthurium undulifolium is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental leaves and ability to purify indoor air."
