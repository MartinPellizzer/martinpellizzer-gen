    "intro": "Alliaria macrantha, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces rounded, seed-containing pods that mature in the second year of its life cycle. Garlic mustard contains glucosinolates, which contribute to its pungent odor and potential allelopathic effects on other plants. It has been introduced to North America and is considered an invasive species in many regions."
