    "intro": "Asplenium thunbergii, commonly known as the Thunberg's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments. Native to East Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and produce a dense rosette of fronds, which are typically evergreen throughout the year. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
