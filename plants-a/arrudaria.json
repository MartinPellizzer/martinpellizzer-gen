    "intro": "Arrudaria, commonly known as the yellow dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and a hollow, hairless stem. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads. Arrudaria is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
