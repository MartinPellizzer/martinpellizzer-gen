    "intro": "Asplenium vallisclausae, commonly known as the valley wall fern, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
