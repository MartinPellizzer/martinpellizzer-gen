    "intro": "Axonopus centralis, commonly known as carpet grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense, mat-like growth that often covers the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a nuisance and a resilient plant in various ecosystems."
