    "intro": "Acer paxii var. integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a variant of the maple tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its smooth, entire leaves that are typically bright green during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds known as samaras. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable species in the study of alpine flora.",
