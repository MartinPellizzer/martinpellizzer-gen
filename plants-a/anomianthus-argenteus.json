It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its elegant, narrow leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It is a hardy succulent that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
