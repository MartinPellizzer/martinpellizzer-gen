    "intro": "Asclepias elegans, commonly known as the elegant milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a fuzzy texture. Asclepias elegans is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
