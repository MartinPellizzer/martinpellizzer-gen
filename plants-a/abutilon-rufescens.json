    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rufescens is primarily native to Central America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and parts of Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in dry to moist forests and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to warm climates and can tolerate a variety of soil types. Its natural range extends into the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rufescens was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often found in regions with moderate rainfall. This plant is commonly spread through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or human activity. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
