    "intro": "Agrostis tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. Its foliage is typically green, with a bluish tint, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Agrostis tandilensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat."
