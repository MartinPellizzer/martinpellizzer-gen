    "intro": "Alnus prunifolia, commonly known as the sweet birch, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, aromatic bark and alternate, serrated leaves. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Alnus prunifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
