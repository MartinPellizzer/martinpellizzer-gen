    "intro": "Asplenium urbani, commonly known as the urban spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in shaded, moist environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium urbani is often found in urban areas, thriving in the crevices of buildings and walls."
