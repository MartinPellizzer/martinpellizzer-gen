    "intro": "Acer obtusatum subsp. aetnense, commonly known as the Aetna maple, is a deciduous tree native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, rocky conditions of its native habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in Mediterranean ecosystems.",
