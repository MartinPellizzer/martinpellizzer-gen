    "intro": "Aizoon cryptocarpum, commonly known as the hidden fruit lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its dense, foliose thallus that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous fruiting bodies called apothecia, which are often hidden beneath the surface of the thallus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Aizoon cryptocarpum plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
