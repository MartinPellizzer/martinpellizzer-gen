    "intro": "Arabis perstellata, commonly known as the star-like wintercress, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features basal rosettes of pinnately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring. Its flowers are arranged in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. Arabis perstellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
