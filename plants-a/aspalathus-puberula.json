It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Aspalathus puberula is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some areas."
