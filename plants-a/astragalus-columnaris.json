    "intro": "Astragalus columnaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus columnaris is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
