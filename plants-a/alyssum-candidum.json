    "intro": "Alyssum candidum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and profuse clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often covering the plant in a dense display. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Alyssum candidum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
