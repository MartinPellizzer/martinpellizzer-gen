    "intro": "Astragalus oreades, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky, dry habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus oreades is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
