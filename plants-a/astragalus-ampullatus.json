    "intro": "Astragalus ampullatus, commonly known as the bladder milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its seed pods are inflated and resemble bladders, which is where it gets its common name. Astragalus ampullatus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
