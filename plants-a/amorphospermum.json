    "intro": "Amorphospermum, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa and are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers. Amorphospermum species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. The genus includes several species, such as *Amorphospermum africanum*, which is known for its ornamental value. Due to the presence of toxic compounds, these plants are generally not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
