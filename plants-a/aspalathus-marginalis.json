    "intro": "Aspalathus marginalis, commonly known as the sweet cycad, is a unique plant native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is a member of the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its stout, trunk-like stem and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are pollinated by insects. Aspalathus marginalis is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat, with a dormant period during the wet season. Its ornamental value and ecological significance make it an important species in local ecosystems."
