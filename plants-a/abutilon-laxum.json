    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon laxum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in northern regions like Venezuela and Ecuador. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its distribution extends into the Caribbean islands, where it adapts well to the warm and humid conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon laxum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped leaves and showy flowers. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to produce numerous seeds and thrive in disturbed soils. Despite its ornamental appeal, efforts are being made to control its spread to prevent ecological harm."
