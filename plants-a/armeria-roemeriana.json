    "intro": "Armeria roemeriana, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray. Armeria roemeriana is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
