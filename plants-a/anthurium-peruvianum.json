    "intro": "Anthurium peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian flame or Peruvian anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped bracts that range in color from red to orange, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium peruvianum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
