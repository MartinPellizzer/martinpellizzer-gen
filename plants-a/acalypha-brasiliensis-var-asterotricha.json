This variant is found in the states of Bahia, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its range. It plays an important role in the ecological dynamics of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. asterotricha was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. This species is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Brazil, Florida, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has been largely driven by its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
