    "intro": "Angraecum acutipetalum var. ankeranae, commonly known as the Ankerana orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically produces pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
