    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre subsp. tortuosum, commonly known as the Alpine Alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly curled or twisted appearance, giving it the subspecies name *tortuosum*. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
