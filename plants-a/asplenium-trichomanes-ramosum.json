    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes-ramosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock faces or in shaded forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium trichomanes-ramosum is a hardy species that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
