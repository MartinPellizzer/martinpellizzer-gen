    "intro": "Arnica pedunculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its medicinal properties. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive."
