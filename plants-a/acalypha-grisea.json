    "intro": "Acalypha grisea, commonly known as grayleaf spurflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its grayish-green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Acalypha grisea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grisea is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often seen in scrublands and desert habitats. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grisea was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and moist environments, often as a result of human activity. It is commonly found in urban and suburban settings where it thrives in compacted or nutrient-poor soils. The plant spreads through its prolific seed production and can establish itself quickly in new locations. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its competitive nature and ability to outgrow native vegetation. Its distribution is largely influenced by climate conditions and the availability of suitable habitats."
