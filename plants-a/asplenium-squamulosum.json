    "intro": "Asplenium squamulosum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are covered in small, scale-like structures that provide a silvery sheen, contributing to its common name. Asplenium squamulosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in indoor settings with proper care."
