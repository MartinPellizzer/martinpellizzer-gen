    "intro": "Altamiranoa fusca, commonly known as the dark-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude grasslands of South America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, compact stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
