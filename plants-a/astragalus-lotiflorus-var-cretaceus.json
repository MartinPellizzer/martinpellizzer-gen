    "intro": "Astragalus lotiflorus var. cretaceus, commonly known as the Cretaceous milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy seed pods that contain small, round seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
