    "intro": "Aster vallicola, commonly known as the valley aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and produces showy blue to purple flowers in the summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Aster vallicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
