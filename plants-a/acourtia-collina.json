    "intro": "Acourtia collina, commonly known as the slender acourtia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Acourtia collina is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to coastal climates.",
