    "intro": "Arctagrostis latifolia f. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves are narrow and have a fine texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in landscaping. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
