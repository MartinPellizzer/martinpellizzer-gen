    "intro": "Amsinckia kennedyi, commonly known as Kennedy's fiddleneck, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
