    "intro": "Aquilegia baltistanica, commonly known as the Baltistan columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Karakoram and Himalayan regions. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
