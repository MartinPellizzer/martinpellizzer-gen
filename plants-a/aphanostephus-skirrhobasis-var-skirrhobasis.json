    "intro": "Aphanostephus skirrhobasis var. skirrhobasis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, pale green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots help it survive in sandy, well-drained soils, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry grasslands."
