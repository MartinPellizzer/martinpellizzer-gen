    "intro": "Artemisia campestris var. subspicata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent is well documented."
