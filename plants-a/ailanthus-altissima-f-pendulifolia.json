    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima f. pendulifolia, commonly known as the weeping tree of China, is a variant of the tree of heaven. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is a deciduous tree with compound leaves that are pinnately arranged. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by woody, triangular seed pods. This cultivar is often used in ornamental horticulture for its visual appeal, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
