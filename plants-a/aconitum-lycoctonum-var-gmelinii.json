    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, preferring cooler climates. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
