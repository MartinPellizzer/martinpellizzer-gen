It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pink or white flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant has a compact growth habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to extreme climates and contribute to its ecological importance in its native range."
