    "intro": "Asplenium crinulosum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on the bases of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines along the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium crinulosum is a relatively uncommon species, often found in temperate regions with high humidity and cool temperatures."
