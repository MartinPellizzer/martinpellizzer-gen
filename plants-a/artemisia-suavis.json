    "intro": "Artemisia suavis, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, including monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which contribute to its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in open woodlands or rocky areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of the antimalarial compound artemisinin."
