    "intro": "Androsace pomeiensis, commonly known as the Pomei Androsace, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
