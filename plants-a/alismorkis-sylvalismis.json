    "intro": "Alismorkis sylvalismis, commonly known as the forest marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of temperate regions. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are alternate and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its root system consists of fibrous rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy or waterlogged soils. Alismorkis sylvalismis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
