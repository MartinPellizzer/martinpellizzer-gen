    "intro": "Allium acre, commonly known as field garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbous stem is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Botanically, it is closely related to other Allium species such as garlic and onions."
