    "intro": "Aeschynomene villosa var. villosa, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy glands, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a velvety texture. Aeschynomene villosa var. villosa is adapted to poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
