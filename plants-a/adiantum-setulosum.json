    "intro": "Adiantum setulosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum setulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
