    "intro": "Athyrium flabellulatum, commonly known as the Japanese male fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to eastern Asia. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Athyrium flabellulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shady garden settings."
