    "intro": "Astragalus caespitosus, commonly known as the tufted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils, often in sagebrush steppe or desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are pinnately compound with small, rounded leaflets. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules, which can benefit soil fertility. Astragalus caespitosus is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological value."
