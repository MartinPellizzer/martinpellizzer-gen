    "intro": "Airopsis aurea, commonly known as the golden tunicate, is a unique marine alga that belongs to the class Rhodophyceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish to orange coloration, which comes from the presence of carotenoids. The plant forms a gelatinous, tubular structure that is often found attached to rocky substrates in shallow coastal waters. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a thallus that is composed of filaments. Airopsis aurea plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
