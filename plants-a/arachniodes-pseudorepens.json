    "intro": "Arachniodes pseudorepens, commonly known as the creeping spider fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often trail along the ground, giving it a creeping growth habit. The plant features a network of rhizomes that help it spread and colonize shaded, moist environments. Its leaves are typically divided into small, finger-like segments, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Arachniodes pseudorepens thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect light."
