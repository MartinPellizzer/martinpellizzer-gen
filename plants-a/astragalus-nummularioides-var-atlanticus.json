    "intro": "Astragalus nummularioides var. atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal areas of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
