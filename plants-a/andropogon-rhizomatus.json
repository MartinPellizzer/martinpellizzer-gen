    "intro": "Andropogon rhizomatus, commonly known as flat grass or flat bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense clumps and spread vegetatively. The plant has narrow, flat leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Andropogon rhizomatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
