    "intro": "Astilbe intermedia, commonly known as the Chinese astilbe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of delicate, plume-like inflorescences in shades of pink, white, or red. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, with the showy bracts serving as the primary attraction. Its leaves are lance-shaped and form a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Astilbe intermedia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
