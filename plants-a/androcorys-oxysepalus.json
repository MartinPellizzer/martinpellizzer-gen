    "intro": "Androcorys oxysepalus, commonly known as the sharp-sepal orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated sepals that are often brightly colored, typically in shades of red or orange. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that bloom during the cooler months, usually from late winter to early spring. Its roots are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils, and it requires a humid, cool climate to flourish. The orchid is notable for its unique floral structure and is often found in high-altitude cloud forests."
