    "intro": "Angraecum odoratissimum, commonly known as the sweet scent orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence and large, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as the giant hawkmoth. Its unique floral structure and nocturnal blooming habit are adaptations to its specialized pollination system. Angraecum odoratissimum is a prime example of co-evolution between plants and their pollinators."
