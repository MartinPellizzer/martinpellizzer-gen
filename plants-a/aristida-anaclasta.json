It is a perennial grass that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
