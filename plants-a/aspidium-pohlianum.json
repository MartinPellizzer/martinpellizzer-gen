    "intro": "Aspidium pohlianum, commonly known as the Pohlian's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to rocky surfaces or soil. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
