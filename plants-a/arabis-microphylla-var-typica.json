    "intro": "Arabis microphylla var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has alternate, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
