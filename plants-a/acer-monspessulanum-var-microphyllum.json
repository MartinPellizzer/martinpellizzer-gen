    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The tree produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age. This variety is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streamside habitats.",
