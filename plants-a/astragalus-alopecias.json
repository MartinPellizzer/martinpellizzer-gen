    "intro": "Astragalus alopecias, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical, yellowish pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Astragalus alopecias plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
