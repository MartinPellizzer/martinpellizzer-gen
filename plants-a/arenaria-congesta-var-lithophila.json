    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. lithophila, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well-suited for alpine and rocky habitats. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
