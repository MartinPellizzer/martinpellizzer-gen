    "intro": "Astracantha rumelica subsp. taygetica, commonly known as the Taygetic Astracantha, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern Greece. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
