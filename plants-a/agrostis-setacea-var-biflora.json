    "intro": "Agrostis setacea var. biflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences, with two to three flower clusters per stem, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and typically have a bluish-green hue. This variety is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and fine texture."
