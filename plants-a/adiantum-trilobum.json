It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds in specialized structures called sori.
