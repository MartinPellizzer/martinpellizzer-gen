    "intro": "Acanthophyllum glandulosum var. roseum, commonly known as the pink spiny broom. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plant features pale green to grayish foliage with dense, spiny stems that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink to rose-colored, adding visual interest to its otherwise desolate habitat. It is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum glandulosum var. roseum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and parts of western China. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert steppes and dunes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures and limited water availability. It plays a significant role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered an important component of the local ecosystem in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum glandulosum var. roseum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in regions such as the southwestern United States, parts of Mexico, and some areas of the Middle East. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low precipitation. Its presence in these regions has been documented in ecological studies focusing on native and invasive plant species."
