It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, followed by small, red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has a fibrous root system and exhibits some degree of drought tolerance once established."
