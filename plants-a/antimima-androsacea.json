    "intro": "Antimima androsacea, commonly known as the Androsace bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, basal leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens. Antimima androsacea is also known for its ability to tolerate cold climates and is relatively drought-resistant once established."
