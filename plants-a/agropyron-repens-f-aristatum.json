    "intro": "Agropyron repens f. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive tufted growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces spikelets that are elongated and bear awns, giving it a unique appearance. It is well adapted to dry and disturbed soils, making it a common species in grasslands and along roadsides. This form is often used in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
