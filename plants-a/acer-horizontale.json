    "intro": "Acer horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its spreading, horizontal branches that create a distinctive, umbrella-like shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. Its leaves are palmately lobed and turn vibrant yellow in autumn, adding ornamental value. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping for its unique form and seasonal color changes.",
