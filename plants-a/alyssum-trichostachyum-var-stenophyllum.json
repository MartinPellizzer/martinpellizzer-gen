    "intro": "Alyssum trichostachyum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with compact clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
