    "intro": "Aleuritopteris wuyishanensis, commonly known as the Wuyi Mountain water fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
