    "intro": "Aconitum rubellum, commonly known as the red monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple and red flowers that bloom in late summer, forming a helmet-like shape. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
