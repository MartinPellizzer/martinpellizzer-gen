This species is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in areas with tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in humid environments and is often found in forested areas or near water sources. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. Its native range is limited to specific regions within China, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wui was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in countries such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
