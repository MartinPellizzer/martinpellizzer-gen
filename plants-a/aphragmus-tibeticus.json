    "intro": "Aphragmus tibeticus, commonly known as the Tibetan bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of its habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Aphragmus tibeticus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental requirements."
