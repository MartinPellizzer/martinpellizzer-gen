    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha colombiana is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It is commonly found in lowland areas with humid climates, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often associated with riverbanks and forest edges. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in parts of northern Peru and western Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha colombiana was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been found in several states, including Florida, Texas, and California, where it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has shown potential to establish itself in the wild, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to discussions about its invasiveness and the need for monitoring in non-native regions. However, current data suggest it is not yet classified as a major invasive species in these areas."
