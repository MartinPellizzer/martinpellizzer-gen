    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. gnaphalodes, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Its strong, camphor-like scent is due to the presence of volatile essential oils, particularly thujone and camphor."
