    "intro": "Asplenium brausei, commonly known as the Brause's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly found in areas with high humidity and shade. The plant has finely divided, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as on tree trunks or rocks. Asplenium brausei is noted for its delicate appearance and is often used in horticultural collections due to its ornamental value."
