It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late summer. Ammannia longifolia thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
