    "intro": "Alyssum discolor, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum discolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
