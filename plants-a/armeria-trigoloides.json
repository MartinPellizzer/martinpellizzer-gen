    "intro": "Armeria trigoloides, commonly known as the three-toothed thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the shorelines. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Armeria trigoloides is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in coastal gardens."
