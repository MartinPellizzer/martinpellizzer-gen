    "intro": "Astragalus chloridae, commonly known as the green milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils."
