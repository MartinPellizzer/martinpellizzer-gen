    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually hairy or pubescent, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Alnus hirsuta is often found in moist, nitrogen-poor soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Its ecological importance makes it a valuable species in reforestation and wetland restoration projects."
