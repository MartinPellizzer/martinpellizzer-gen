    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha jerzedowskii is primarily native to Mexico Central. This plant is found in the central regions of Mexico, including states such as Hidalgo, Puebla, and Tlaxcala. It typically grows in dry to semi-arid environments, often in rocky or disturbed soils. The species is adapted to the warm and sunny climate of this region. It is a relatively rare plant with a limited geographic range within Mexico Central.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha jerzedowskii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. This species is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, making it a potential invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its competitive nature and potential impact on native flora. Despite its ornamental value, careful management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
