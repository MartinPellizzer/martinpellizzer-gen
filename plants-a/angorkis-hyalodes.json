    "intro": "Angorkis hyalodes, commonly known as the glassy angorkis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, translucent coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and stems are known for their high water content, which helps the plant thrive in arid environments. Angorkis hyalodes is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations."
