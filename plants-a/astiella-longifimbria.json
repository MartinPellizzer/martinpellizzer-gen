    "intro": "Astiella longifimbria, commonly known as the long-fringed astiella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of its family. Astiella longifimbria thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
