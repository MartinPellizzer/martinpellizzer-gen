    "intro": "Abarema subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-stemmed acacia, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its woody stems covered with a rough, coriaceous texture, which gives it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and it is often found in dry, open habitats. Abarema subcoriacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema subcoriacea is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. This plant grows in the cerrado biome, which is characterized by seasonal tropical grasslands and shrublands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry season conditions of the region. Abarema subcoriacea is commonly found in open areas and along roadsides within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema subcoriacea was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value and ease of care. Although it is not considered invasive in its native range, it has been reported in some areas where it may compete with native species. Its distribution has expanded through horticultural trade and garden plantings. Due to its non-invasive nature, it is generally regarded as a safe and beneficial addition to local flora in appropriate environments."
