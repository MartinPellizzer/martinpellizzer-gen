    "intro": "Androcymbium volutum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant features striking, brightly colored flowers that bloom in a helical pattern along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a tight spiral. Androcymbium volutum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unusual floral structure."
