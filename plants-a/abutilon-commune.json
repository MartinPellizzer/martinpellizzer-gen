    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon commune is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in humid environments and is commonly found in coastal areas. It is also present in parts of Central America and the Caribbean. Its natural range includes various types of forests and open habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon commune was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and along coastal regions, making it difficult to control. Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
