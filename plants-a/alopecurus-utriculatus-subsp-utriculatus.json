    "intro": "Alopecurus utriculatus subsp. utriculatus, commonly known as the bulblet bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomes and bulb-like structures, called bulbils, allow for vegetative propagation and contribute to its persistence in disturbed soils. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks."
