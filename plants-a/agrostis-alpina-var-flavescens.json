    "intro": "Agrostis alpina var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow alpine bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to golden flowers, which are adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, tundra, and mountainous areas. Due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal, it is occasionally used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
