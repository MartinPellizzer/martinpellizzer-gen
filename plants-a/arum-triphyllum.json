It features a distinctive arrow-shaped leaf that is usually light green with a yellowish midrib. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
