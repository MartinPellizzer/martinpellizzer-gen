    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus var. rudis, commonly known as the red pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves that form a rosette shape, and its flowering stem produces a cluster of red, fleshy fruits. The plant is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its fruit is edible, though less commonly consumed than the common pineapple. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
