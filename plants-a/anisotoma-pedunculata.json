    "intro": "Anisotoma pedunculata, commonly known as the mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and aromatic, small, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Anisotoma pedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
