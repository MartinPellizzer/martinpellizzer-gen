    "intro": "Alternanthera celosioides, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or pink foliage, which becomes more intense under strong light conditions. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, nutrient-rich water and is popular in freshwater aquariums for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
