    "intro": "Aspidogyne rosea, commonly known as the rose spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidogyne rosea is often found in forests and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
