It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, fibrous trunk, which is often used in traditional crafts. The Tussac fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and habitat for various organisms."
