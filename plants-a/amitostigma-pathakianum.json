    "intro": "Amitostigma pathakianum, commonly known as the Pathak's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western Nepal. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are compound and divided into small, lance-shaped lobes, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of alkaloids in its tissues."
