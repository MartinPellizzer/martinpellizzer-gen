    "intro": "Aquilegia fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, yellow, and orange, arranged in a distinctive crown-like pattern. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are palmately compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets that are deeply lobed."
