    "intro": "Arenaria uralensis, commonly known as the Ural sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of tiny white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where temperatures are low and the growing season is short. Arenaria uralensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
