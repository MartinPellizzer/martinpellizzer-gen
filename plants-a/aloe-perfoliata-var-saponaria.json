    "intro": "Aloe perfoliata var. saponaria, commonly known as the soap aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in summer. Its leaves contain a gel that has mild soap-like properties, hence its common name. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with ample sunlight."
