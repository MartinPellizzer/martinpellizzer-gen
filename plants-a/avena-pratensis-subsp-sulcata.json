    "intro": "Avena pratensis subsp. sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct sulcate (grooved) surface. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature and nutritional value, it is sometimes cultivated as forage for livestock."
