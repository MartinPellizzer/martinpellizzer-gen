    "intro": "Anisophyllum lineare, commonly known as the linear leaf fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically 10 to 30 centimeters long. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered into sori covered by a protective indusium. Anisophyllum lineare thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique morphology makes it a distinctive and often sought-after species in horticulture."
