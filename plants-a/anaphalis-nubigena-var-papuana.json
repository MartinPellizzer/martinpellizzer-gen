It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant is distinguished by its dense, white to grayish-white foliage, which gives it a woolly appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
