    "intro": "Arenaria moritziana, commonly known as Moritz's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in tundra and alpine habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a characteristic component of polar and high-altitude ecosystems."
