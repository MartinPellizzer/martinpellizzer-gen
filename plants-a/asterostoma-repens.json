    "intro": "Asterostoma repens, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in wetlands. Its leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense inflorescences. Asterostoma repens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
