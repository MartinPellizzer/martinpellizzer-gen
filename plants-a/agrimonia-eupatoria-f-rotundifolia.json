    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria f. rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf agrimony, is a botanical variant of the common agrimony. It is characterized by its rounded, broad leaves that differ from the typical lance-shaped foliage of the species. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This form is valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
