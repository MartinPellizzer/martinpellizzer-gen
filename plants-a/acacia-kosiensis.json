    "intro": "Acacia kosiensis, commonly known as the Kosi acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellowish-green globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Acacia kosiensis is adapted to dry environments and is often found in savannas and woodland areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kosiensis is primarily native to parts of eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Sudan. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. It is often seen along riverbanks and in open grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Acacia kosiensis is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kosiensis was mainly introduced to areas with a tropical and subtropical climate, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced for purposes such as soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its distribution is also expanding due to human activities and climate change."
