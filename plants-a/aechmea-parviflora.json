    "intro": "Aechmea parviflora, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual impact. Its foliage is often variegated with silver or white markings, enhancing its ornamental value. Aechmea parviflora thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
