    "intro": "Asplenium septentrionale var. sasakii, commonly known as the Sasakii rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and unique frond structure, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on cliff faces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
