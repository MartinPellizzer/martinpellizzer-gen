    "intro": "Astragalus sessiliceps, commonly known as the sessilehead milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus sessiliceps plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
