It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with dense, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Azorella triscuspidata is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in cold, rocky environments with poor soil. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
