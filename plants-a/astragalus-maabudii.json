    "intro": "Astragalus maabudii, commonly known as the Maabudii milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
