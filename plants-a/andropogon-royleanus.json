    "intro": "Andropogon royleanus, commonly known as red grass, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish coloration, particularly in its inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous texture, and it produces dense, spike-like clusters of small, reddish flowers. Andropogon royleanus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in soil stabilization."
