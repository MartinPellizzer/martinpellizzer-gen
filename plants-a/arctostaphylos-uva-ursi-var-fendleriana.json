It features dense, leathery foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a waxy surface. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in early spring. Its fruits are small, red berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and drought tolerance."
