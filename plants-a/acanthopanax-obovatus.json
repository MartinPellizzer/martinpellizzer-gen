    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax obovatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with dense forests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth forests and disturbed habitats. It is known for its climbing habit and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax obovatus was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It is often cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas for its aesthetic value. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates contributes to its spread. Proper management is necessary to prevent it from outcompeting native species in non-native habitats."
