    "intro": "Astragalus subinduratus var. pseudoindurascens, commonly known as the smooth milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, leathery texture and is often found in dry steppe and desert habitats."
