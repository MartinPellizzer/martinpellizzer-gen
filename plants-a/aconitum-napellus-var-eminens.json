    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. eminens, commonly known as the giant monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the Alps. It is characterized by its tall, spires of blue-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
