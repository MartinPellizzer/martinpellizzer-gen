    "intro": "Annamocarya indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
