    "intro": "Acacia sorophylla, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened, leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in arid conditions. Acacia sorophylla is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is also an important species for local wildlife, providing nectar for birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sorophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Avon-Heathcote Estuaries. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and near-coastal environments. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Acacia sorophylla is well adapted to the dry and sometimes saline conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sorophylla was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its introduction has been primarily for soil stabilization and as an ornamental species. However, it can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
