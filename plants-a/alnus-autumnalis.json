    "intro": "Alnus autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn alder, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus autumnalis plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
