    "intro": "Aspidium pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its unique morphology and ornamental qualities make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and indoor cultivation."
