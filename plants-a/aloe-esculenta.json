    "intro": "Aloe esculenta, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright leaves that are typically narrow and covered in a white powdery substance called farina. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Aloe esculenta is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its gel is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is less commonly cultivated for commercial purposes compared to other aloe species."
