    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved dwarf almond, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, oval leaves that are broader than those of the typical almond species, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, sweet pods containing almond-like seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and culinary potential. Due to its hardy nature, it can thrive in a variety of soil types and is relatively drought-tolerant."
