    "intro": "Anthoxanthum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grass or green oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum brevifolium is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
