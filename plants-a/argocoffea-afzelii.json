The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves and produces small, white flowers that develop into red, fleshy fruits. The fruits contain seeds that are used to make a type of coffee, though it is not as widely cultivated as other coffee species. Its botanical features make it an important plant in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
