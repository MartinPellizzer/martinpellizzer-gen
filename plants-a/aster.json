    "intro": "Aster, commonly known as the aster flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that typically feature a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Aster species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils. They are perennial herbs with erect stems and alternate leaves, and many species produce seeds in the form of small, dry fruits called cypselae. The genus includes over 150 species, many of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
