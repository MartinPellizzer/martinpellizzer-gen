    "intro": "Amethystanthus manabeanus, commonly known as the Manabe's amethyst flower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
