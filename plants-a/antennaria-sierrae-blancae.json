    "intro": "Antennaria sierrae-blancae, commonly known as the Sierra white-rayed pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada range in California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cold, short growing season of high-altitude environments. Antennaria sierrae-blancae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystem."
