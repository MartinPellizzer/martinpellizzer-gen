    "intro": "Armoracia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
