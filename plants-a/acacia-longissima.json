    "intro": "Acacia longissima, commonly known as the longleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Acacia longissima is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and a slow growth rate. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia longissima is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. This species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these areas. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Its presence is a testament to the plant's resilience in native Australian landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia longissima was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region, North Africa, and parts of California. It has been widely planted for its ornamental value and as a source of timber. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several areas outside its native range. However, it can sometimes become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain ecosystems."
