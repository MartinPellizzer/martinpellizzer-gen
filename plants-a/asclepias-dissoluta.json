    "intro": "Asclepias dissoluta, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, hairy seeds with a silky appendage, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias dissoluta is also known for its milky sap, which contains latex and is toxic to some animals. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch butterfly."
