    "intro": "Acetosella polyantha, commonly known as the purple sorrel, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded woodland areas. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is noted for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor. Acetosella polyantha is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens.",
