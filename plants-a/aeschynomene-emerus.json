    "intro": "Aeschynomene emerus, commonly known as the African needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and savannas. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Aeschynomene emerus is also valued for its use in livestock forage and as a component in soil stabilization efforts."
