It thrives in rocky soils and open habitats. It is commonly seen in desert environments and along dry stream beds. Its native range is limited to specific regions within Mexico's southwestern states.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha confertiflora was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique flower clusters. It is commonly found in landscapes, gardens, and as a hedging plant in areas with warm climates. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Its rapid growth rate makes it suitable for erosion control and as a living fence. However, it has also become an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
