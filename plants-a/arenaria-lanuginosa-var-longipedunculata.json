    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long-stemmed moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features silvery-gray foliage due to the presence of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of long, slender peduncles. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in alpine gardens."
