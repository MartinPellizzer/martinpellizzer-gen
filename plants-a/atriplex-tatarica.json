    "intro": "Atriplex tatarica, commonly known as Russian thornweed, is a perennial shrub native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and along roadsides. Atriplex tatarica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
