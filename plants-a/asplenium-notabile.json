    "intro": "Asplenium notabile, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically broad and deeply lobed. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. Asplenium notabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
