    "intro": "Artemisia sericophylla, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its aromatic leaves and resilience to drought make it a valuable plant in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
