    "intro": "Acacia blakei subsp. diphylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna. Due to its ecological importance, it is often included in conservation and revegetation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia blakei subsp. diphylla is primarily native to New South Wales. It is found in the southeastern part of the state, particularly in the coastal and tableland regions. This subspecies thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the local climate and plays an important role in the native vegetation of the area. The plant is also sometimes seen in disturbed areas due to its resilience and ability to regenerate quickly.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia blakei subsp. diphylla was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and floral displays. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range, including parts of California and the Mediterranean Basin. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
