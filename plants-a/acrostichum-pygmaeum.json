It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Acrostichum pygmaeum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
