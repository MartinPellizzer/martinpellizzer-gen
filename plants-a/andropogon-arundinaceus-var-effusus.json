    "intro": "Andropogon arundinaceus var. effusus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that release lightweight seeds for wind dispersal. Switchgrass is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low maintenance requirements."
