    "intro": "Aspidium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium angustifolium plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native range."
