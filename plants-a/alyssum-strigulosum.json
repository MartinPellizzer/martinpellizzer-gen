    "intro": "Alyssum strigulosum, commonly known as sand alyssum, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, narrow leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies adds ecological value to its habitat."
