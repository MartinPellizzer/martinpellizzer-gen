    "intro": "Agave newberyi, commonly known as the Newbery\u2019s agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Agave newberyi is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
