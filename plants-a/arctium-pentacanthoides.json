    "intro": "Arctium pentacanthoides, commonly known as the five-lobed burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, hairy foliage. The plant produces large, spiny, brownish-purple burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Its leaves are palmately lobed with five to seven lobes, and the flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbels. Arctium pentacanthoides is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
