    "intro": "Arenga plicata, commonly known as the sago palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that eventually develop into red, fleshy fruits. Arenga plicata is widely cultivated for its starch-rich pith, which is used in the production of sago. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions makes it a popular ornamental and agricultural plant."
