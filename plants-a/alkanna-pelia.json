    "intro": "Alkanna pelia, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody, branching structure and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its bark and roots contain a reddish pigment called alkannin, which has been historically used in dyes and traditional medicine. Alkanna pelia is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
