    "intro": "Aubrieta vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic aubrieta, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine or rock garden settings. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including extreme temperatures and poor soil quality. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and its ability to bloom reliably year after year."
