    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaste pulchra is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist woodlands. This plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or loamy soils near the coast. Acaste pulchra is known for its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaste pulchra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, which contributes to its spread. Management efforts are ongoing to control its population and prevent further ecological damage."
