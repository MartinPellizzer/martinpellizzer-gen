    "intro": "Agave cantula, commonly known as the white agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences. Agave cantula is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
