    "intro": "Aspidostemon occultus, commonly known as the hidden starflower, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Loganiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring, often in shades of white and pale purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Aspidostemon occultus is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a botanically significant species due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
