It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green or white flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and prefers shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the spring.
