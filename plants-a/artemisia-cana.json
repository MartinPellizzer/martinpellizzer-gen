    "intro": "Artemisia cana, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in compact, spherical clusters called capitula. Artemisia cana is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
