This plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native habitat. Its natural distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia integrifolia was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in shaded to partially shaded environments. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value, including its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage. It has been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, leading to concerns about its invasive potential. However, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited impact in its introduced range."
