    "intro": "Allophylus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by small, round berries that are often red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Allophylus coriaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
