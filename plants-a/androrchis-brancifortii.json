    "intro": "Androrchis brancifortii, commonly known as the Branciforte orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant produces a single, large, violet or purple flower with a distinctive lip that is often marked with contrasting patterns. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in horticultural collections."
