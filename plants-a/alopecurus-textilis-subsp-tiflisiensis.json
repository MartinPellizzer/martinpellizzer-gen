    "intro": "Alopecurus textilis subsp. tiflisiensis, commonly known as the Tiflis hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight hairy texture, contributing to its common name. This subspecies is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
