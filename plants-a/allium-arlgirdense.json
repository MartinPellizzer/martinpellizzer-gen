    "intro": "Allium arlgirdense, commonly known as the Algarve garlic, is a rare bulbous plant native to the Algarve region of Portugal. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round bulbs that are often used in local cuisine for their mild garlic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, typically growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
