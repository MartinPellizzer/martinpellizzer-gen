It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
