    "intro": "Aperiphracta martiana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, dark green leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Aperiphracta martiana is valued for its hardiness and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
