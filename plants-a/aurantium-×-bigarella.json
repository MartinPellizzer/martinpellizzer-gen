    "intro": "Aurantium \u00d7 bigarella, commonly known as the citron orange, is a hybrid citrus plant resulting from the cross between the pomelo (Citrus maxima) and the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata). It is characterized by its large, thick-skinned fruit that is typically yellow to orange in color when mature. The plant is evergreen, with glossy, dark green leaves and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fruit is often used for its high vitamin C content and is also valued in traditional medicine."
