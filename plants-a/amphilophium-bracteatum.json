    "intro": "Amphilophium bracteatum, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
