    "intro": "Aulomyrcia dealbata, commonly known as the white-flowered cypress, is a species of coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae and is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its cones are woody and contain seeds. Aulomyrcia dealbata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant form and seasonal color changes. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and faces threats from habitat loss and climate change."
