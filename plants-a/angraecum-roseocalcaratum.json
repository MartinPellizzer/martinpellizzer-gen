    "intro": "Angraecum roseocalcaratum, commonly known as the rose-flowered spider orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers with intricate, spidery petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
