    "intro": "Arabis horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
