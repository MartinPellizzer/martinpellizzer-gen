    "intro": "Acaena niederleinii, commonly known as the New Zealand brakebush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces small, hard, bead-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Acaena niederleinii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena niederleinii is primarily native to the South Island of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the eastern and southern regions, particularly in areas with moist, temperate climates. This plant thrives in forest margins, shrublands, and open habitats, often growing in association with other native flora. It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of New Zealand, including its soil types and climate patterns. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena niederleinii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant is now considered an invasive species in certain regions of the country. It spreads rapidly in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites, posing ecological challenges."
