    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 ramosum, commonly known as the red maple hybrid, is a deciduous tree that exhibits a range of botanical characteristics. It is a natural hybrid between *Acer rubrum* (red maple) and *Acer saccharum* (sugar maple), resulting in a species with variable morphology. The tree typically has smooth, gray bark and palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red in autumn. It produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its propagation. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in eastern North America.",
