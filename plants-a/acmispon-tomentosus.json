It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its hairy stems and leaves are notable features that help reduce water loss in its native habitat.",
