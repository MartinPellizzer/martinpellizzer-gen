    "intro": "Aster verticillatus, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a native North American plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a hairy texture. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
