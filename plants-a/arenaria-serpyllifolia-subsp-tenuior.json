    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. tenuior, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small white or pink flowers in late spring. The subspecies is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other members of the species. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
