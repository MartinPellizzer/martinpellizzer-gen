    "intro": "Allocarya tenuifolia var. longipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf alpine grass, is a perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
