    "intro": "Azorella nitens, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of leaves that form a compact cushion-like structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Azorella nitens is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with strong sunlight. Its unique morphology allows it to survive in harsh mountainous climates where few other plants can grow."
