    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ceraceopunctata is primarily native to Benin, Burkina, Cameroon, Chad, Ghana, and Nigeria. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ceraceopunctata was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in coastal and lowland areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a significant ecological concern. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
