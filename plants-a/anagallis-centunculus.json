    "intro": "Anagallis centunculus, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive, spurred appearance. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate, herbaceous appearance. Anagallis centunculus is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer."
