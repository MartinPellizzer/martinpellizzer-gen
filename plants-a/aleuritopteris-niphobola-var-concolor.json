    "intro": "Aleuritopteris niphobola var. concolor, commonly known as the dark fronded water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aleuritopteris. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
