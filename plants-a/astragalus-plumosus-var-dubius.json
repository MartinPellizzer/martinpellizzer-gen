    "intro": "Astragalus plumosus var. dubius, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is fibrous and can reach considerable depth, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is often found in disturbed sites and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
