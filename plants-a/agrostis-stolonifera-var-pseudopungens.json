    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. pseudopungens, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive appearance and ability to form dense, low-growing turf."
