    "intro": "Arachis stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf groundnut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, round pods containing one or two seeds, which are used as a food source in some regions. Arachis stenophylla is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
