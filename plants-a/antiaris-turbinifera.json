    "intro": "Antiaris turbinifera, commonly known as the arrow leaf or the tree of heaven, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are typically lobed and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by orange to red berries containing seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas and can grow as a tree or shrub. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
