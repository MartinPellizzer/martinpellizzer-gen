    "intro": "Anabasis lachnantha, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Anabasis lachnantha plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
