    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. littorea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage and spiny, cylindrical flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
