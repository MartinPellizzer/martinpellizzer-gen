    "intro": "Andrachne hypoglauca, commonly known as the pale sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Andrachne hypoglauca is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
