    "intro": "Acalypha uleana, commonly known as the red-twig dogwood, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red stems that stand out against its green foliage, especially during the winter months. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that give it a showy appearance. Its leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy surface. Acalypha uleana is often used in ornamental gardening for its seasonal color and adaptability to various soil types.",

It is commonly found in the southern regions of Brazil, including the states of Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is also occasionally found in cultivated environments and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely tied to the unique ecological conditions of southern Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha uleana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been distributed across various countries in the Pacific, including Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines. It is often used in landscaping and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in shaded environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
