    "intro": "Avena bromoides subsp. requienii, commonly known as the Mexican oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Botanically, it is noted for its morphological similarity to other Avena species, though it is distinguished by specific genetic and floral characteristics."
