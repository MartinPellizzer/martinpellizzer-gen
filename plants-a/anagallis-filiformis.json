    "intro": "Anagallis filiformis, commonly known as the slender pink or slender waterpink, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils. The plant features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its flowers are small, pinkish-white, and borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Anagallis filiformis is often found in wet meadows, streambanks, and other damp habitats."
