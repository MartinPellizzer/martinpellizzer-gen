    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern native to temperate regions. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and resilient nature."
