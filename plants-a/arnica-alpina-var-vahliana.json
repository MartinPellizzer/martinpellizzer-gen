    "intro": "Arnica alpina var. vahliana, commonly known as the alpine tawny hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive central disk. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This variety is often mistaken for other arnica species due to its similar floral structure and coloration."
