    "intro": "Alchemilla paupercula, commonly known as the poor man's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla paupercula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
