    "intro": "Asclepias intermedia, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and pairs of opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of orange to yellow flowers with distinctive spurred petals, which are essential for attracting pollinators like monarch butterflies. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to some animals but vital for the survival of monarch caterpillars. Asclepias intermedia thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
