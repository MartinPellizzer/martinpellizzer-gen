    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 minakuchii, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium nipponicum. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a subtle metallic sheen. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. Athyrium \u00d7 minakuchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in both outdoor gardens and indoor settings."
