    "intro": "Ardisia densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Following flowering, it produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia densiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
