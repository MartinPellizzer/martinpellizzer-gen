    "intro": "Angophora costata subsp. euryphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved angophora, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often glaucous underneath. The plant produces small, red or pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
