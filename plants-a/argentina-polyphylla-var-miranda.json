    "intro": "Argentina polyphylla var. miranda, commonly known as the Miranda's polyphylla, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of Argentina. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are white or pale yellow and are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
