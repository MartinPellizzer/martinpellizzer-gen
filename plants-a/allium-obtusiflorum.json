    "intro": "Allium obtusiflorum, commonly known as the broadflower garlic or Chinese leek, is a bulbous plant native to China. It features a tall, leafy stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with broad, flat leaves that are often used in culinary applications. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in the summer. Its bulbs are similar to garlic in appearance but have a milder flavor and are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes grown in gardens for its visual appeal."
