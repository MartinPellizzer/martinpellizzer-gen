    "intro": "Astragalus sempervirens subsp. catalaunicus, commonly known as the Catalaunic horseshoe vetch, is a perennial legume native to southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and forest-steppe habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
