    "intro": "Asarum costatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive, spicy aroma. The plant produces small, reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies."
