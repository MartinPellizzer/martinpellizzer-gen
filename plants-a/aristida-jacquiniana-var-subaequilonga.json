    "intro": "Aristida jacquiniana var. subaequilonga, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-awned spikelets, which are characteristic of the Aristida genus. This species is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
