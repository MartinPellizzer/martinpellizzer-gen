    "intro": "Arundinaria dimorpha, commonly known as the bamboo bamboo, is a species of grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 12 feet. The plant has two distinct forms: the flowering form, which is more robust, and the sterile form, which is more commonly cultivated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a grassy aroma. Arundinaria dimorpha is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
