It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in narrow, cylindrical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
