    "intro": "Acacia arabica var. kraussiana, commonly known as the Arabian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and compound leaves that are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular inflorescences, which are followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptability to hot, dry climates. This species is valued for its ecological role and has been used traditionally for its wood and gum.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. kraussiana is primarily native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in regions of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Oman. It is commonly found in coastal and inland desert areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This variant is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often associated with coastal dunes and can be found in association with other xerophytic vegetation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. kraussiana was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and rocky slopes. This variety is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced to parts of California, Oregon, and southern Australia. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
