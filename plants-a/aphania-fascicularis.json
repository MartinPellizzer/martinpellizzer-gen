    "intro": "Aphania fascicularis, commonly known as the clustered dwarf daphne, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
