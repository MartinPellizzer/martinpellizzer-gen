    "intro": "Ananassa porteana, commonly known as the Brazilian pineapple or Portuguese pineapple, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, waxy leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with bright red flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Ananassa porteana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a tropical or subtropical garden."
