It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or clumps. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and have a bluish-green hue with a slightly hairy surface. It produces small, clustered pink or red flowers in summer, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. This plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
