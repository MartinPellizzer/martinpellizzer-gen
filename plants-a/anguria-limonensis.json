    "intro": "Anguria limonensis, commonly known as the lemon cucumber, is a climbing vine native to South America. It produces small, yellow, lemon-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they are still green. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates. It is often grown in home gardens for its edible fruits, which have a mild, slightly tart flavor. The botanical features of Anguria limonensis make it a unique and interesting addition to both ornamental and culinary plant collections."
