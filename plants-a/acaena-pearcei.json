    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pearcei is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. It is commonly associated with coastal and mountainous areas where the climate is cool and temperate. Acaena pearcei plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pearcei was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and bushy growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand."
