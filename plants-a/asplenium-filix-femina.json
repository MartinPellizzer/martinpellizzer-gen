    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina, commonly known as the lady's bedstraw, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a pale green to reddish-brown coloration, often adorned with tiny, clustered spores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium filix-femina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
