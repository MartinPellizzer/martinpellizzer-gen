    "intro": "Amphistelma ferrigineum, commonly known as the red-stained lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dark reddish to brownish thallus, which often has a granular texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provide nutrients through photosynthesis. It is typically found on tree trunks and branches in temperate forests. Its coloration is due to the presence of secondary metabolites produced by the fungal component."
