    "intro": "Arenaria globuliflora, commonly known as the globular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in the western United States. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. The plant has compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or gravelly soils. Arenaria globuliflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
