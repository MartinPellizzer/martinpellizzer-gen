    "intro": "Asclepias pubiseta, commonly known as the pubescent milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by various insects, including bees and butterflies. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias pubiseta plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a source of nectar and a host plant for their larvae."
