    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. plena, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are often densely packed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens and used in turfgrass mixtures."
