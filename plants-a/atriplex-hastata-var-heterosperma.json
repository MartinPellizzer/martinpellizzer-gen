    "intro": "Atriplex hastata var. heterosperma, commonly known as saltbush or shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh, saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in small, triangular capsules, and the variety heterosperma is distinguished by its variation in seed shape and size. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in desert ecosystems."
