    "intro": "Amesiella philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), while its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
