    "intro": "Apuleja rigida, commonly known as the rigid apuleja, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Apuleja rigida is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
