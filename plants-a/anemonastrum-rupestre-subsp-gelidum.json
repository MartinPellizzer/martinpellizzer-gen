    "intro": "Anemonastrum rupestre subsp. gelidum, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. It is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid and semi-arid regions."
