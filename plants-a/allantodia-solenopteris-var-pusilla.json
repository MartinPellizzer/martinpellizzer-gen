    "intro": "Allantodia solenopteris var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky substrates or in forest understories. The plant features delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and thick, helping it anchor to rocky surfaces. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
