    "intro": "Aequatorium pascoense, commonly known as the Pasco's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aequatorium pascoense is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
