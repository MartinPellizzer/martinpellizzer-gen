It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha benguelensis var. trichogyne was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant is often used as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and ability to grow quickly. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is largely limited by environmental conditions and human activity."
