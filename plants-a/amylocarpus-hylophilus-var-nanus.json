It features a rhizomatous root system that produces starchy tubers, which are its primary botanical feature. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with heart-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spikes, and it is primarily valued for its edible underground storage organs. The tubers are rich in starch and have been traditionally used in local cuisines."
