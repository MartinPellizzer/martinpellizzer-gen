It features heart-shaped, glossy green leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous sheath, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic rhizomes and leaves have been historically used in traditional medicine."
