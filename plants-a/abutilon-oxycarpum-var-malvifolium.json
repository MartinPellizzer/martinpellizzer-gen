It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. It is also present in some regions of Africa, such as Kenya and Tanzania. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains largely within Southeast Asia and eastern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum var. malvifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral characteristics. This variety is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses, where it thrives in mild, moist climates. It has also been reported in some naturalized areas, particularly near water sources. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a non-native species in these regions."
