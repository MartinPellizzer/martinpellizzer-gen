    "intro": "Aechmea biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces showy, short-lived inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are typically broad and have a waxy surface, which helps in water retention. Aechmea biflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
