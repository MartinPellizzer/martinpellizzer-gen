    "intro": "Ambrosia dentata, commonly known as the toothed ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of small, yellow-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. It is an annual herb that plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. However, it is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
