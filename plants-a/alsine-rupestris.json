    "intro": "Alsine rupestris, commonly known as the rock alsike, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in crevices and on dry slopes, adapting to harsh, low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are usually small, succulent, and arranged in a rosette pattern to minimize water loss. The flowers are often pale purple or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
