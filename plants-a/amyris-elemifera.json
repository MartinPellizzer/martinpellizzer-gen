    "intro": "Amyris elemifera, commonly known as the white sand pine, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant has slender, branching stems with long, needle-like leaves that are dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the tree produces fragrant, orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. Amyris elemifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments."
