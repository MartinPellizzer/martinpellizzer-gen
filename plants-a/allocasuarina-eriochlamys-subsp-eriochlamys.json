    "intro": "Allocasuarina eriochlamys subsp. eriochlamys, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, spine-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
