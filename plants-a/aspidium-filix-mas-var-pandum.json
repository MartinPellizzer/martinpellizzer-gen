    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. pandum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night. This unique trait makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
