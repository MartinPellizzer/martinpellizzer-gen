    "intro": "Adromischus alveolatus, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact, rounded shape with dense clusters of small, fleshy, spineless stems. The plant produces bright red to orange flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are often mistaken for flowers due to their similar color and shape. Adromischus alveolatus is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements.",
