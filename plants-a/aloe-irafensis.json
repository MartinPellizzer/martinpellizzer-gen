    "intro": "Aloe irafensis, commonly known as the Ira Forest Aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Tanzania. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow or orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Aloe irafensis is valued for its resilience to drought and its potential medicinal properties, though it remains a less-studied species in botanical research."
