It features upright stems that bear clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Astrantia alpina is often used in rock gardens and as a hardy ornamental plant in gardens with full sun."
