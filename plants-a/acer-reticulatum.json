    "intro": "Acer reticulatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The tree has a slender, upright growth habit with a branching pattern that creates a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. Acer reticulatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",
