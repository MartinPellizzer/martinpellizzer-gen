    "intro": "Anagallis dekindtiana, commonly known as the De Kindt's mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and delicate, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is often found in alpine or subalpine regions, where it blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
