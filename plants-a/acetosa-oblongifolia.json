    "intro": "Acetosa oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its roots are rich in oxalic acid, which contributes to its tart flavor. Acetosa oblongifolia is often found in moist, nutrient-rich soils along streambanks and woodland edges.",
