    "intro": "Acacia ligulata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and have a distinctive, narrow, linear shape. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. This variety is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ligulata var. angustifolia is primarily native to southern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands. This variety is known for its slender, narrow leaves and yellow flowers, which appear in winter or early spring. It is commonly found in coastal areas and inland regions with low rainfall. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ligulata var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in revegetation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has been particularly beneficial in areas prone to desertification. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target environments."
