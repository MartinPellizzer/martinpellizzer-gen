    "intro": "Alnus arguta var. benthamii, commonly known as the bentham's alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks."
