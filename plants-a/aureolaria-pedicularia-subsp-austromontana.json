    "intro": "Aureolaria pedicularia subsp. austromontana, commonly known as the Australian stickyweed, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its sticky leaves and seeds help it retain moisture and disperse seeds effectively in its arid habitat."
