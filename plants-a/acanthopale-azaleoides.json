    "intro": "Acanthopale azaleoides, commonly known as the pink azale, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is adapted to acidic, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in shaded environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopale azaleoides is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland and hill forests, often growing in shaded, moist environments. This plant is typically associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites within its native range. It is known for its attractive, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many parts of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopale azaleoides was mainly introduced to areas with moist, acidic soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in forested or disturbed habitats. It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and high humidity, making it suitable for temperate climates. This plant is often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests, where it competes with other shade-tolerant species. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes, contributing to its spread in new environments."
