    "intro": "Asclepias praemorsa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth plant, is a species of milkweed native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, bean-like seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias praemorsa is a vital host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its ecological importance is further enhanced by its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
