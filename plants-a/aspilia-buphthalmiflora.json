    "intro": "Aspilia buphthalmiflora, commonly known as the giant African dandelion, is a striking herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in dense, spherical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
