    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. cylindrostachya, commonly known as the sticky alder or cylinder-stamened alder, is a variant of the common alder native to parts of Asia. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its sticky, resinous bark and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces cylindrical stamens, which are unique to this variety and contribute to its botanical distinction. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often oval in shape, with a serrated margin. This species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges."
