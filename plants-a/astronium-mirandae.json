    "intro": "Astronium mirandae, commonly known as the Mirand\u00e1 palm, is a rare and striking plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that eventually develop into edible, coconut-like fruits. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Astronium mirandae is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
