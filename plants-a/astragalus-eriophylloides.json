It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has compound leaves with small, thread-like leaflets and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus eriophylloides is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
