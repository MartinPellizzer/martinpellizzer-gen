    "intro": "Allosorus viscidus, commonly known as the sticky allosorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that produce a sticky secretion, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Allosorus viscidus is often found in wetlands and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
