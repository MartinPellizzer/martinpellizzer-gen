    "intro": "Allium desertorum, commonly known as the desert onion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its deep root system and waxy leaf surface that reduces water loss. Allium desertorum is often found in rocky soils and is a component of desert ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
