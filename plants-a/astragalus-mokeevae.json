    "intro": "Astragalus mokeevae, commonly known as Mokeev's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant produces distinctive pod fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
