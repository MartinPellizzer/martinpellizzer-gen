    "intro": "Ancistrocladus extensus, commonly known as the African bitterleaf, is a small shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Celastraceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is occasionally used in traditional medicine."
