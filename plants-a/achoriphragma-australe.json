    "intro": "Achoriphragma australe, commonly known as the Australian sandbur, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common trait in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Achoriphragma australe thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia.",
