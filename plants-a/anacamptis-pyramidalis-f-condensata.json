    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis f. condensata, commonly known as the compact pyramidal orchid, is a botanical variant of the pyramidal orchid. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and shorter, more clustered inflorescences compared to the typical form. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, violet-blue flowers in late spring. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
