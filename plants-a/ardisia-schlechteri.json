    "intro": "Ardisia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's evergreen boxwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the island of Madagascar and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
