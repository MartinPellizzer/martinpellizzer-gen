    "intro": "Asclepias nummularioides, commonly known as the silverleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and contains latex sap that is toxic to some animals. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
