    "intro": "Angiopteris crassiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris crassiuscula plays a vital role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
