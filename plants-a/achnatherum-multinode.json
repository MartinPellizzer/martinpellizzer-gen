    "intro": "Achnatherum multinode, commonly known as the multinode needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of numerous small spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Achnatherum multinode is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil.",
