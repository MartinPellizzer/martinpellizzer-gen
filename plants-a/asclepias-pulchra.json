    "intro": "Asclepias pulchra, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-orange flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Asclepias pulchra plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens."
