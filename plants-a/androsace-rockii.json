    "intro": "Androsace rockii, commonly known as the rock androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically white or pink, with five petals, and bloom in early spring. Androsace rockii thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
