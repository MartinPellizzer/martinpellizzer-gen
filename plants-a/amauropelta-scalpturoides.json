    "intro": "Amauropelta scalpturoides, commonly known as the scalpturoides shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-like fronds that are tightly clasped around the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in high humidity. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Amauropelta scalpturoides is considered a rare and often overlooked species in botanical studies."
