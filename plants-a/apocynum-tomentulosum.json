    "intro": "Apocynum tomentulosum, commonly known as the wooly dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to herbivores. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides and in wetlands."
