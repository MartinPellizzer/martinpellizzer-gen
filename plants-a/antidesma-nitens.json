    "intro": "Antidesma nitens, commonly known as the red antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical gardens. Antidesma nitens is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
