It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus ecbatanus is often found in steppe and mountainous regions, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local biodiversity."
