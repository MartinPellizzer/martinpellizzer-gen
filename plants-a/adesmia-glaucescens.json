    "intro": "Adesmia glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green legume, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a bluish-gray hue, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces elongated, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Adesmia glaucescens is adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry woodlands and rocky soils.",
