    "intro": "Agrostis gigantea subsp. gigantea, commonly known as giant bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Its growth habit makes it a valuable component of native plant communities and a potential indicator of wetland health."
