    "intro": "Anacheilium pamplonense, commonly known as the Pamplona orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of northern Spain. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, thriving in cool, humid microclimates. Its botanical features include hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it adapt to its specific ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
