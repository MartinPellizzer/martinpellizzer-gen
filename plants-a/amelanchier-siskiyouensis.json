    "intro": "Amelanchier siskiyouensis, commonly known as the Siskiyou serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas, often in the Pacific Northwest. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it has a compact, rounded form. The Siskiyou serviceberry is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
