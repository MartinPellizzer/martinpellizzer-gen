    "intro": "Ajuga campylanthoides, commonly known as narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common ornamental and ecological plant in suitable habitats."
