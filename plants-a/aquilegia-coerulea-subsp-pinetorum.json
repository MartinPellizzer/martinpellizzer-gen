    "intro": "Aquilegia coerulea subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces showy, clustered flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to other Aquilegia species."
