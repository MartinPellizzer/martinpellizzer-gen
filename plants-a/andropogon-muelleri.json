    "intro": "Andropogon muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and prairies, where it thrives in moist to wet soils. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Mueller's bluestem is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to support local wildlife."
