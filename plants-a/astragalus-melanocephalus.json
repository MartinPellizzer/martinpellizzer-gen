    "intro": "Astragalus melanocephalus, commonly known as black-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus melanocephalus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in degraded habitats."
