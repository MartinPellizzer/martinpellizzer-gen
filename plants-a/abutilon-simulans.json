    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon simulans is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, and Mexico Southwest. This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It typically grows in open forests, disturbed sites, and along stream banks. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of its native range. Its natural distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon simulans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and spreads rapidly through seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
