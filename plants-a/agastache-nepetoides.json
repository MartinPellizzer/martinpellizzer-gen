    "intro": "Agastache nepetoides, commonly known as wild mint or blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, tubular blue to purple flowers in whorls along the upper stems, which bloom from midsummer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Agastache nepetoides is also a valuable nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
