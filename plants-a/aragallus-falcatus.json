    "intro": "Aragallus falcatus, commonly known as the sickleleaf spurge, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, falcate (sickle-shaped) leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Aragallus falcatus is typically found in alpine meadows and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
