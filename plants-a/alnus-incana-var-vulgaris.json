    "intro": "Alnus incana var. vulgaris, commonly known as gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish bark, which becomes fissured with age, and its opposite, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Gray alder is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
