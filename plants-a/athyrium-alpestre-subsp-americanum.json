    "intro": "Athyrium alpestre subsp. americanum, commonly known as the Appalachian lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, or sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
