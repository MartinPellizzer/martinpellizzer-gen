    "intro": "Adlumia cirrhosa, commonly known as the climbing bladderpod, is a perennial vine native to the eastern United States. It features slender, twisting stems that climb using small tendrils, often reaching lengths of up to 10 feet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, followed by inflated, bladder-like seed pods that turn brown as they mature. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Adlumia cirrhosa thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, rich soils.",
