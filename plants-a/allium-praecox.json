    "intro": "Allium praecox, commonly known as early leek, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and broad, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbel-like clusters, which appear in early spring. Its bulbs, which are edible, are often used in culinary applications similar to leeks or onions. Allium praecox thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
