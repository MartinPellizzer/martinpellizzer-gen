It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
