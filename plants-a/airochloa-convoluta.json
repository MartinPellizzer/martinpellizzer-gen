    "intro": "Airochloa convoluta, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, wiry, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit with a dense clump of foliage, and its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves. Airochloa convoluta is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
