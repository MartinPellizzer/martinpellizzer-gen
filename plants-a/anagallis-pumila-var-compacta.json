    "intro": "Anagallis pumila var. compacta, commonly known as the dwarf pink willow or miniature blue-eyed Mary, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, with a distinctive blue eye at the center. The plant has slender, wiry stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
