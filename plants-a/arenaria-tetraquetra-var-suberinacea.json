    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. suberinacea, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, forming small, mat-like cushions that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate floral display to its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss in dry conditions. This variety is particularly adapted to rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
