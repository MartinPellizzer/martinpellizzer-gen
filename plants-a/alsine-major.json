It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Alsine major is often found in disturbed areas and is used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
