    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. serrata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and branched, often spiky inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and wastelands. The leaves and flowers contain volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal uses."
