    "intro": "Atropis distans var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal marsh willow, is a variant of the marsh willow native to coastal regions. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, a feature common in many willow species. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife."
