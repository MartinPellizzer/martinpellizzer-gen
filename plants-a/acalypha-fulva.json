    "intro": "Acalypha fulva, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers, creating a vivid visual display. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture with a reddish tinge. Acalypha fulva thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha fulva is primarily native to Peru. It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in areas with moist, tropical climates. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often seen growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is known for its striking red bracts that attract pollinators. Its native distribution is largely confined to the western part of Peru, where it plays an important ecological role.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fulva was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a concern for native ecosystems. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local biodiversity."
