    "intro": "Astragalus pisidicus var. longidens, commonly known as the long-seeded milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods that give it its specific epithet \"longidens.\" It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. The plant is often found in steppe and desert scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
