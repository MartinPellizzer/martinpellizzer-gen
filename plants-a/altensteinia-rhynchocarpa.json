It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like fruits that develop from its showy, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit, which is a capsule, contains several seeds and is adapted for dispersal by wind or animals."
