    "intro": "Anthyllis collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow, pea-like flowers in early spring. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, leathery leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. Anthyllis collina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
