    "intro": "Aira speciosa, commonly known as the showy air plant, is a species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a flowering plant in the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of showy, panicle-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aira speciosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
