    "intro": "Allium plurifoliatum var. zhegushanense, commonly known as the Zhegushan garlic chive, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are similar to onions but have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
