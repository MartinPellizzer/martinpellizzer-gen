    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha digynostachya is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Brazil South, Brazil Southeast, and Paraguay. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha digynostachya was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activities such as horticulture or accidental transport. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. It is now found in various habitats across the islands, including coastal and lowland regions. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems."
