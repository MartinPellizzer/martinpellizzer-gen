    "intro": "Astragalus scariosus, commonly known as the scaly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range. Astragalus scariosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its habitat."
