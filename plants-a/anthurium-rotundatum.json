    "intro": "Anthurium rotundatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble a spatula-shaped structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium rotundatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
