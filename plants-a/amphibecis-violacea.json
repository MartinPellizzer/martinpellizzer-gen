It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking violet-blue petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Amphibecis violacea is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
