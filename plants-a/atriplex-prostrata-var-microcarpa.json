    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata var. microcarpa, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to coastal and saline soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
