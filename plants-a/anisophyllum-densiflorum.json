    "intro": "Anisophyllum densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower anisophyllum, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers throughout the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
