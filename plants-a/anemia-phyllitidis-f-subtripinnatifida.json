    "intro": "Anemia phyllitidis f. subtripinnatifida, commonly known as the subtripinnate bladderwrack, is a variant of the bladderwrack species found in coastal regions. It is a brown alga characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like fronds that are often branched in a subtripinnate pattern. The plant exhibits a complex thallus structure with a central axis and multiple lateral branches. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it attaches to rocky substrates using a holdfast. Its botanical features make it an important component of marine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and coastal habitat complexity."
