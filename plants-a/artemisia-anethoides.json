It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Artemisia anethoides has been used historically for its medicinal and pesticidal properties."
