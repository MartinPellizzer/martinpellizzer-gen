    "intro": "Agropyron smithii, commonly known as the wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and bluish-green leaves, which are often used in livestock feed and human nutrition. The plant is highly drought-resistant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its seeds are small and produce a dense, fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Agropyron smithii is also valued for its ability to regenerate quickly after grazing or fire."
