    "intro": "Astragalus arbuscula var. mixotricha, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with hairy surfaces and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its morphology and adaptability make it an important species in ecological and restoration contexts."
