    "intro": "Agapetes prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate silverleaf, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically silver-gray in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters during the spring. Agapetes prostrata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in cooler climates."
