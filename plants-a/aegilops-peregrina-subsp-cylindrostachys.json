    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina subsp. cylindrostachys, commonly known as the cylindrical-stalked wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its genetic makeup is of interest to researchers studying wild relatives of cultivated barley due to its potential for improving crop resilience. This subspecies plays a role in both ecological systems and agricultural genetics."
