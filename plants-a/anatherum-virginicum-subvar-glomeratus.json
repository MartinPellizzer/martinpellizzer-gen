    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. glomeratus, commonly known as Virginia grass or clustered false brome, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often borne in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its rhizomatous growth and its ability to form dense stands in wetland environments."
