    "intro": "Arcytophyllum vareschii, commonly known as the Armenian sandthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange to red fruits that are edible but have a bitter taste. It is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
