    "intro": "Austrostipa scabra, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are rough to the touch, giving it its common name, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Austrostipa scabra plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small fauna."
