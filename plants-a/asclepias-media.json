    "intro": "Asclepias media, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to reddish-purple flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators. The plant produces distinctive seed pods called follicles, which split open to release silky-haired seeds. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy coating and have a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Asclepias media plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
