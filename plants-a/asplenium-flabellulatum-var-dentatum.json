    "intro": "Asplenium flabellulatum var. dentatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf spleenwort, is a fern species characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often as an epiphyte. Its leaves are densely arranged, with a delicate, lace-like appearance, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variety is distinguished by its serrated leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet \"dentatum.\""
