    "intro": "Astragalus andrasovszkyi, commonly known as the Hungarian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Carpathian Basin. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are typically arranged along the upper part of the stem. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus andrasovszkyi is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential medicinal properties."
