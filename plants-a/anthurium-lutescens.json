    "intro": "Anthurium lutescens, commonly known as the golden anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow spathes that enclose the spadix, which is often a vibrant red or orange. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium lutescens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
