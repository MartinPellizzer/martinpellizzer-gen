    "intro": "Aequatorium albiflorum, commonly known as the whiteflower aequatorium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the late spring and early summer. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aequatorium albiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
