    "intro": "Apodynomene aemula, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has no leaves, relying solely on its roots for nutrient absorption from the air and rain. Due to its habitat requirements and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern."
