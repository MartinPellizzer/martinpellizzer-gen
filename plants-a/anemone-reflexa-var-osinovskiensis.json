    "intro": "Anemone reflexa var. osinovskiensis, commonly known as the Osinovskii anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive reflexed (bent backward) petal shape, which gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
