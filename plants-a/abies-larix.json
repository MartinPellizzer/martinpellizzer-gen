    "intro": "Abies larix, commonly known as the larch, is a species of coniferous tree belonging to the genus Abies in the family Pinaceae. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which turn yellow and fall off in autumn, making it one of the few deciduous conifers. The tree typically grows in cool, moist climates and is found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in temperate and subarctic regions. Its cones are small and woody, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. The bark of Abies larix is usually gray or reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies larix is primarily native to northern Europe, western Siberia, and parts of northern Asia. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. This species is commonly found in mountainous regions and boreal forests. It is particularly adapted to high-altitude environments where temperatures are low. Its natural range extends across several countries including Russia, Norway, and Sweden.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies larix was mainly introduced to regions where its cold-hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it suitable for reforestation and ornamental purposes. It has been planted in various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, as a decorative tree and for ecological restoration. However, its introduction has sometimes led to competition with native species and potential ecological imbalances. Despite its ornamental value, its spread can be invasive in certain environments. Proper management is necessary to mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
