    "intro": "Aylostera fiebrigii var. azurduyensis, commonly known as the Azurduy's aylostera, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus and other aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
