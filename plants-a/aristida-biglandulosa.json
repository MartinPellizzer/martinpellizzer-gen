    "intro": "Aristida biglandulosa, commonly known as the broad-ribbed dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in restoration projects. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with erect, slender stems that produce delicate, wind-pollinated flowers."
