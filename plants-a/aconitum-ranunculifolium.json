    "intro": "Aconitum ranunculifolium, commonly known as the leopard's bane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the buttercup, giving it its common name. Aconitum ranunculifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
