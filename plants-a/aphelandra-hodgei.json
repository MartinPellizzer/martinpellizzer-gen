    "intro": "Aphelandra hodgei, commonly known as the Hodge's flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red bract-like flowers that resemble flames, which bloom in clusters during the dry season. The plant has large, elliptical leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra hodgei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display."
