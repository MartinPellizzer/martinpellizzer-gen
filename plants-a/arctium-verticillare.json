    "intro": "Arctium verticillare, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a biennial plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust, hairy stem and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are surrounded by bracts that form the characteristic bur-like structures. These burs are equipped with hooked seeds that adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
