    "intro": "Allomaieta grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered allomaieta, is a striking plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that features showy, bright yellow flowers with prominent dark veins, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
