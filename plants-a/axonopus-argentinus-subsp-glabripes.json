    "intro": "Axonopus argentinus subsp. glabripes, commonly known as the Argentine flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit makes it a suitable ornamental plant in water gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
