    "intro": "Antennaria appendiculata, commonly known as the creeping mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
