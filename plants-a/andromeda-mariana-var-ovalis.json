    "intro": "Andromeda mariana var. ovalis, commonly known as the ovalleaf wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the northeastern United States. It features elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring, which are typically pink or red. Its berries, which appear in the summer, are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in acidic, well-drained soils."
