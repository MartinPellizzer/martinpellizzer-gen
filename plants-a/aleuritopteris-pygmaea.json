    "intro": "Aleuritopteris pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of water bodies. Aleuritopteris pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
