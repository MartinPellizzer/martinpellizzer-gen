It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and long, slender, silky-hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
