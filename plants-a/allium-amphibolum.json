    "intro": "Allium amphibolum, commonly known as the water garlic, is a perennial plant native to the wetlands of southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a useful addition to gardens. Botanically, it is closely related to other allium species, including onions and leeks."
