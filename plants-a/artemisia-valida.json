It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in arid, rocky soils. Artemisia valida has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for its medicinal properties."
