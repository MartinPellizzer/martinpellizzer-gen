    "intro": "Avena aspera var. roylei, commonly known as rough oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture availability. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native habitat."
