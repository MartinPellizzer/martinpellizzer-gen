It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant features lanceolate to ovate leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base on the lower leaves. Its rhizomes are creeping and often covered in fine roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
