    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. minor, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of dark green, hairy, and slightly succulent leaves that are arranged in a compact, shield-like pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in open, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional herbal remedies and are also popular in ornamental gardening for their attractive foliage."
