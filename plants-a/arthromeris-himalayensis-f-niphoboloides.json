    "intro": "Arthromeris himalayensis f. niphoboloides, commonly known as the Himalayan starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
