    "intro": "Anil maritima, commonly known as sea anemone, is a marine invertebrate belonging to the phylum Cnidaria. It is characterized by its radial symmetry and a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. The organism possesses a unique structure called a gastrovascular cavity, which functions in both digestion and circulation. Anil maritima typically inhabits shallow coastal waters and is often found attached to rocks or other substrates. Its life cycle includes both a polyp stage and a medusa stage, which are essential for its reproductive process."
