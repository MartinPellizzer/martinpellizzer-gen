    "intro": "Agrimonia sessiliflora, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, branched stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are dry, achene-like structures that are dispersed by wind. Agrimony has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
