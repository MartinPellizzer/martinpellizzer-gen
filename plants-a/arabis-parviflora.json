    "intro": "Arabis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This perennial herb typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or coastal areas. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, and its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
