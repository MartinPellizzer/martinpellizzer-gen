    "intro": "Amauropelta laevigata, commonly known as the smooth frilled fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, frilled fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
