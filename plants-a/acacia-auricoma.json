    "intro": "Acacia auricoma, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Acacia auricoma is a symbol of Australia and plays an important role in the country's ecological and cultural landscape.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia auricoma is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region. Acacia auricoma is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of water and suitable soil types in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia auricoma was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed sites. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in different soil types have contributed to its establishment in the wild. While it is not considered highly invasive, it has the potential to outcompete native species in certain environments. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on local ecosystems."
