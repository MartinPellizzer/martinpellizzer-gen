    "intro": "Andropogon tectorum var. acutatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
