    "intro": "Apocynum oblongum, commonly known as the Indian apple or dogbane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a herbaceous perennial that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, featuring opposite, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, elliptical seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
