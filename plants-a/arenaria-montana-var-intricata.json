    "intro": "Arenaria montana var. intricata, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with dense clusters of tiny, rounded leaves that help it thrive in rocky or gravelly soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its intricate leaf patterns and delicate flowers make it a distinctive and ornamental species in its native habitat."
