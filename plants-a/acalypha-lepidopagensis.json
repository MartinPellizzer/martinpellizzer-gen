It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of Madagascar, which are distinct from other regions. The plant plays a role in the local flora and may contribute to the ecological balance of its habitat. Its native distribution highlights the biodiversity of Madagascar's plant life.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lepidopagensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds. Conservation efforts are underway to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
