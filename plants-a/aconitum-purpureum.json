    "intro": "Aconitum purpureum, commonly known as the purple aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking purple to blue flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spiny clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aconitum purpureum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it highly dangerous to both humans and animals.",
