    "intro": "Acer colchicum, commonly known as the Turkish maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens or as a decorative element in landscapes. Acer colchicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its vibrant autumn foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer colchicum is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains region. It is commonly found in moist, woodlands and along streams in the southeastern states. This species thrives in areas with well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and can be found in states such as Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia. The plant is known for its striking red or orange autumn foliage, making it a notable species in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer colchicum was mainly introduced to North America through horticultural trade in the 19th century. It was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking red autumn foliage. The plant has since naturalized in several regions, particularly in the eastern United States. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
