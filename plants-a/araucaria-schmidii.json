    "intro": "Araucaria schmidii, commonly known as the Schmid's Araucaria, is a coniferous tree native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
