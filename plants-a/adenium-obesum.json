    "intro": "Adenium obesum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a succulent plant native to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, fleshy leaves. The plant has a striking red or pink flower that blooms at the top of the stem. Its unique morphology allows it to store water efficiently, making it well adapted to arid environments. Adenium obesum is also known for its toxic sap and has been used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.",
