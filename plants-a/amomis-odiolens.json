    "intro": "Amomis odiolens, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, erect stems above the water. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its seeds are dispersed by water currents. The sacred lotus is also noted for its cultural and medicinal significance in many traditional practices."
