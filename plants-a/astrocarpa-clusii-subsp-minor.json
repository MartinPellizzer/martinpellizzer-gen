It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with three stamens and a three-lobed pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family.
