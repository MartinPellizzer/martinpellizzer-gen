It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that are often red or purple in color, which serve to attract pollinators.

The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in spikes, which are borne on the ends of the branches.",

It is commonly found in wetland areas, along riverbanks, and in moist woodlands. This variant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. It is a shrub or small tree that plays an important role in local ecosystems. Its distribution is largely restricted to the lower Mississippi River basin and adjacent regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lindheimeri var. major was mainly introduced to Texas, where it has established itself in various habitats. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along creek banks. This plant is known for its vibrant red bracts that attract pollinators and add visual interest to the landscape. It has been reported in several counties across the state, particularly in the central and southern regions. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both natural and human-altered environments."
