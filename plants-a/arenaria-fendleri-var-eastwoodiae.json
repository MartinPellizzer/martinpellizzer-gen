It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
