    "intro": "Acorus angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in temperate regions. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically sword-shaped, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose its spores, which are dispersed by wind. Acorus angustatus is often found in still or slow-moving water, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments.",
