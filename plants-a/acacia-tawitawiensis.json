This species is found in the northern part of the island of Basilan, specifically within the Tawitawi Islands group. It thrives in coastal areas and lowland rainforests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. The plant is adapted to the humid tropical climate and is often found in secondary growth forests. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tawitawiensis was mainly introduced to the Philippines, specifically to the island of Tawi-Tawi, where it is native. It is a small to medium-sized tree that thrives in tropical climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and secondary forests. The plant is known for its distinctive bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers, which make it a popular ornamental species. It has been cultivated in some parts of the country for its ecological and potential economic value. However, its introduction outside its native range is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
