    "intro": "Astragalus schmalhausenii, commonly known as Schmalhausen's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and support local biodiversity."
