    "intro": "Asparagus aphyllus subsp. stipularis, commonly known as the stipular asparagus, is a unique variant of the asparagus genus characterized by its reduced foliage. This subspecies is notable for its leafless stems, which are often covered in small, scale-like structures called stipules. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating a high degree of drought tolerance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in xerophytic plant adaptations."
