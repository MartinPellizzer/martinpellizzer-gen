    "intro": "Agropyron scabriglume, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Agropyron scabriglume is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
