    "intro": "Arisaema triphyllum, commonly known as the Indian turnip, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded spathe that encloses a spadix, which bears small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a short, thick rhizome and produces a single, leafy stem with three large, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies and beetles, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is also known for its edible tuberous root, though it contains calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation."
