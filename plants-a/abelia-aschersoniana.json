    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia aschersoniana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern and southeastern China, including areas in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. This plant is also native to parts of Korea and has been introduced to other regions for ornamental purposes. It is commonly found in elevations ranging from 600 to 1,500 meters above sea level. Its natural range includes both temperate and subtropical climates within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia aschersoniana was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowering and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across the eastern United States, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soil. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and is known for its clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can sometimes become invasive. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent it from spreading beyond cultivated areas."
