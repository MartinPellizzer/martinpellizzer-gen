    "intro": "Arnica subplumosa var. silvatica, commonly known as the forest arnica, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, where it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, though it is often avoided in cultivation due to its toxicity."
