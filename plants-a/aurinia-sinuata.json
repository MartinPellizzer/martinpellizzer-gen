    "intro": "Aurinia sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous aurinia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely domesticated."
