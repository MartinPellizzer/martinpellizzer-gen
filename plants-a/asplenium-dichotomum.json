    "intro": "Asplenium dichotomum, commonly known as the dichotomous spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, forest floors, and stream banks. The plant has a distinctive appearance, with fronds that are divided into two equal parts, giving it a unique, dichotomous branching pattern. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. Asplenium dichotomum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in both indoor and outdoor settings with proper care."
