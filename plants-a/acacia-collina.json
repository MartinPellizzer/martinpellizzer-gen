    "intro": "Acacia collina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and yellow-green in color. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Acacia collina is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is also valued for its use in landscaping and as a source of timber and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia collina is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in grasslands, savannas, and rocky outcrops in these regions. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia collina is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in the areas where it is found.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia collina was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, including California and Texas. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
