    "intro": "Andropogon rufus, commonly known as red switchgrass, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tall, erect growth and reddish tint in the inflorescence. It is a perennial plant that thrives in a variety of soil types, particularly in wet or disturbed areas. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Red switchgrass is also cultivated for its ornamental value and as a potential bioenergy crop."
