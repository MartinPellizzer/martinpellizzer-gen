    "intro": "Aloe distans var. depressa, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or low-growing aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers on tall, branching inflorescences during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in dry climates."
