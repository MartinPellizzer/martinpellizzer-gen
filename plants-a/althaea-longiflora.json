    "intro": "Althaea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are rich in mucilage, which has been used traditionally for its soothing properties. Althaea longiflora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and marshy areas."
