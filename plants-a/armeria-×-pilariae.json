    "intro": "Armeria \u00d7 pilariae, commonly known as the hybrid sea thrift, is a flowering plant that belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Armeria maritima and Armeria pusilla, two species native to coastal areas. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
