It typically forms dense mats of succulent, hairy leaves that are adapted to harsh, alpine environments. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in alpine ecosystems."
