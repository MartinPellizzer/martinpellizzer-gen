    "intro": "Asparagus vulgaris var. maritimus, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a coastal plant adapted to salty, sandy soils. It has slender, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in loose panicles. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is well-suited to maritime climates and is often found along shorelines and dunes."
