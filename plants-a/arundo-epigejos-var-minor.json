    "intro": "Arundo epigejos var. minor, commonly known as the lesser giant reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential invasive species. The flowering spikes, which appear in late summer, produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated."
