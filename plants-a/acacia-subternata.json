    "intro": "Acacia subternata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Acacia subternata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in dry climates. Its flowers are an important nectar source for various pollinators, including bees and birds.",

The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia subternata is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the Northern Territory.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia subternata was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in poor soils and withstand high temperatures. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments. However, it also plays a role in soil stabilization and habitat provision for native wildlife."
