    "intro": "Armoracia brassicoides, commonly known as the wild wasabi or Japanese wasabi, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizome, which is the primary edible part, is similar in appearance to the cultivated wasabi but has a milder flavor. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky areas."
