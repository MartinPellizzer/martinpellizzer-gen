    "intro": "Austroblechnum melanocaulon subsp. pallens, commonly known as the silver frond fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically grayish-white in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate rainforests. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
