    "intro": "Arethusa glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky false lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features showy, pale violet to white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, sticky seeds that aid in its dispersal. Arethusa glutinosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
