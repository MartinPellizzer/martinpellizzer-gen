It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and striking appearance make it a desirable ornamental plant."
