    "intro": "Arenaria uninervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It has small, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers, typically in late spring or early summer. It is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, sunny climates. Its simple, unbranched leaf structure is a key identifying feature."
