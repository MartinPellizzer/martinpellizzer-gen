    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis subsp. tanayensis, commonly known as the Tanay pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear whorled leaves. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers arranged in a pyramidal inflorescence, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and is often found in rocky or humus-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
