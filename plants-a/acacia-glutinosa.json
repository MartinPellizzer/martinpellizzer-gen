    "intro": "Acacia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, dark green leaves that are alternate and pinnate. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers arranged in globular clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and often has a sticky resinous coating, which gives it its common name. Acacia glutinosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant in dry climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia glutinosa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen growing along roadsides, in open woodlands, and on rocky outcrops. Acacia glutinosa is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia glutinosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, the Mediterranean, and parts of the United States. The plant thrives in full sun and can tolerate poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in some areas. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems."
