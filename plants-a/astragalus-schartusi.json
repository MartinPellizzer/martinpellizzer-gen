    "intro": "Astragalus schartusi, commonly known as the Schartus milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
