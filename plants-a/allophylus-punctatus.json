    "intro": "Allophylus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish spot near the base. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. Allophylus punctatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate waterlogged conditions."
