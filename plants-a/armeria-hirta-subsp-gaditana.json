It features compact, evergreen foliage with densely packed, silver-white to gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in tight, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in Mediterranean climates."
