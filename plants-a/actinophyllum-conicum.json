    "intro": "Actinophyllum conicum, commonly known as the conical actinophyllum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive conical shape and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Actinophyllum conicum is typically found in heathlands and open forests, thriving in well-drained soils.",
