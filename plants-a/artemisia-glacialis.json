    "intro": "Artemisia glacialis, commonly known as the glacier wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in narrow, spike-like clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia glacialis thrives in rocky soils and high-altitude meadows, often found in mountainous areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. Its aromatic properties and resilience to harsh climates make it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
