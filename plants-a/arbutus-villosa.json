    "intro": "Arbutus villosa, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, and its lobed, evergreen leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and chaparral habitats. Arbutus villosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
