    "intro": "Aira scoparia, commonly known as false oat or goat's beard, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are typically greenish or pale blue, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Aira scoparia is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and birds."
