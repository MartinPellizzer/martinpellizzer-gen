    "intro": "Asclepias lisianthoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive grayish-green color. Asclepias lisianthoides plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
