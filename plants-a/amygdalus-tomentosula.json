    "intro": "Amygdalus tomentosula, commonly known as the woolly almond, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray pubescent foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain hard-shelled seeds, similar to those of the common almond. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and dryland landscapes."
