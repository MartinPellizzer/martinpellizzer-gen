It is characterized by its alternate, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common ornamental and sometimes invasive species in wetland environments."
