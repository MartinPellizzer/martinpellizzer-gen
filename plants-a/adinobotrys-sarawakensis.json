    "intro": "Adinobotrys sarawakensis, commonly known as the Sarawak starvine, is a climbing shrub native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
