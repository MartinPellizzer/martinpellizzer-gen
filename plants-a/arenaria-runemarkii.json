    "intro": "Arenaria runemarkii, commonly known as the Runemark sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats to conserve heat and moisture. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically white or pink, appearing in early summer. It is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme cold and wind. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
