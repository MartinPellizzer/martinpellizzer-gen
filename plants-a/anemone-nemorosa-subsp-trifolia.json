It features a basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with three leaflets. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, often appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland habitats and is often found in forest understories. The species is characterized by its early blooming period and its role in supporting early pollinators."
