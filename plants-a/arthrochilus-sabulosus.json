    "intro": "Arthrochilus sabulosus, commonly known as the sandy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
