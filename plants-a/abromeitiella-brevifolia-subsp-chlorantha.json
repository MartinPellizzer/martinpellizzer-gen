    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abromeitiella brevifolia subsp. chlorantha is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies thrives in open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and disturbed areas. It is particularly associated with the Pacific Coast and the Cascade Range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abromeitiella brevifolia subsp. chlorantha was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. It thrives in areas with full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas of California. This subspecies is known for its small, blue to purple flowers and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several states in the western United States, where it has established populations in both natural and cultivated settings. However, its spread is generally limited by its specific habitat requirements and climate preferences."
