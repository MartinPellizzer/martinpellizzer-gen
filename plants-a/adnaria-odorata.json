    "intro": "Adnaria odorata, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, hibiscus-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often fragrant. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy coastal soils and is adapted to saltwater environments. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are succulent and can store water. Adnaria odorata plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for marine life.",
