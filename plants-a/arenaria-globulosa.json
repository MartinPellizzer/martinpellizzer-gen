    "intro": "Arenaria globulosa, commonly known as the globular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Arenaria globulosa is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common species in tundra and mountainous habitats."
