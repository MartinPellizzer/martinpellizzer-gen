    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. merinoi, commonly known as Merino's sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, typically reaching heights of 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in tightly packed inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens."
