    "intro": "Alyssum doerfleri, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Alyssum doerfleri is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
