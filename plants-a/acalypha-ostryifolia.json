    "intro": "Acalypha ostryifolia, commonly known as the white-leaf ironwood, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered inflorescences that often display a striking white or pinkish hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by three-winged fruits, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is cultivated in some tropical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha ostryifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is typically associated with lowland and hill forest ecosystems. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha ostryifolia was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its striking foliage making it a popular choice in landscaping. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its distribution is primarily in regions with tropical and subtropical climates where it can establish and spread effectively."
