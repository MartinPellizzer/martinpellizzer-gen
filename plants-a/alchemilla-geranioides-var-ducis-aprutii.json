It features dense clusters of small, bright green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it suitable for water gardens or boggy areas."
