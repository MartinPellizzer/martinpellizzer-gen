    "intro": "Atelophragma arthuri, commonly known as the Arthur's shield-leaf, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are thick and leathery. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
