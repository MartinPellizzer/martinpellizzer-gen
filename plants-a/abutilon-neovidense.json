    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon neovidense is primarily native to Central and South America, including countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in the understory of forests or along riverbanks. It is known for its hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Due to its adaptability, it can also be found in some parts of the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon neovidense was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in some regions. The distribution of Abutilon neovidense has expanded due to human activity and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
