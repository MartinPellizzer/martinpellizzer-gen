    "intro": "Androsace sarmentosa var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has a compact growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
