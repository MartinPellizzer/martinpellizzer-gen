    "intro": "Allophylus occidentalis, commonly known as the western pittosporum, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. The plant has opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green, with a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often not consumed by humans. Allophylus occidentalis thrives in coastal areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
