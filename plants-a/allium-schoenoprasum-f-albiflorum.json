    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum f. albiflorum, commonly known as whiteflower chives, is a botanical variant of the common chive. It is characterized by its white or pale pink flowers, which contrast with the typical purple blooms of the standard species. This form is typically shorter and more compact than the common chive, with narrower leaves. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild garlic-like flavor. The plant is hardy and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for gardens and culinary use."
