    "intro": "Arundinaria rigidula, commonly known as the rigid bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can spread aggressively, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. The plant is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
