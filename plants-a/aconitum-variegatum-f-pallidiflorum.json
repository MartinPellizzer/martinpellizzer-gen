    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum f. pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered variety of the variegated aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, palmate leaves with a variegated pattern of green and white, and its flowers are typically pale blue to white, distinguishing it from the more common blue-flowered forms. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that supports its showy blooms. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
