    "intro": "Aristolochia erecta, commonly known as the Indian Pipe, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often green or purple in color. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture. Despite its striking appearance, Aristolochia erecta is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acids."
