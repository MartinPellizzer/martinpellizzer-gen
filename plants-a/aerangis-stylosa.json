    "intro": "Aerangis stylosa, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky outcrops. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat."
