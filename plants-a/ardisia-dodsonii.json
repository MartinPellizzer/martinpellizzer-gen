    "intro": "Ardisia dodsonii, commonly known as the Dodson's ardisia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Guam in the Mariana Islands. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Ardisia dodsonii is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its restricted range and potential threats from invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species."
