    "intro": "Allium convallarioides, commonly known as the clustered garlic, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true bulbs, though they are actually modified stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium convallarioides is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
