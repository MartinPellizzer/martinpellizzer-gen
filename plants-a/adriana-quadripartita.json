    "intro": "Adriana quadripartita, commonly known as the four-parted adriana, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its quadrifoliate leaves, which are divided into four distinct lobes, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
