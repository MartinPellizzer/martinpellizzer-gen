    "intro": "Aphanes pumila, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Aphanes pumila thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local insect populations."
