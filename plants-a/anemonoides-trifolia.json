    "intro": "Anemonoides trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three deeply lobed leaflets, and its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. It has a short rhizome and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Anemonoides trifolia is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
