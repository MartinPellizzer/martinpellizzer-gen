    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum subf. deminutum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette, helping it to retain moisture in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
