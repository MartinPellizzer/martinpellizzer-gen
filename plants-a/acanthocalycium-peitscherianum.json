It is found in the states of Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Michoac\u00e1n, and San Luis Potos\u00ed. This cactus thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. It is commonly found in limestone hills and mountainous areas. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium peitscherianum was mainly introduced to the United States and parts of Europe through the horticultural trade. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections due to its unique appearance and ease of cultivation. The plant is often grown as a decorative cactus, appreciated for its spiny stems and occasional flowers. It has been reported in several states in the U.S., particularly in regions with arid or semi-arid climates. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems if it were to escape cultivation."
