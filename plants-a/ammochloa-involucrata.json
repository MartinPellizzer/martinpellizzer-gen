    "intro": "Ammochloa involucrata, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Ammochloa involucrata plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dune environments."
