    "intro": "Atriplex californica, commonly known as coast saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It is adapted to salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or coastal scrub habitats. Atriplex californica is an important plant for stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
