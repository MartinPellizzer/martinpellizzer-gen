    "intro": "Atriplex sabulosa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Atriplex sabulosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh, coastal or desert conditions."
