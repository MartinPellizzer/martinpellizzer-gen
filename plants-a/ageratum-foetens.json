    "intro": "Ageratum foetens, commonly known as stinking ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a distinguishing feature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Ageratum foetens is often used in ornamental gardening, though its scent may deter some pollinators."
