    "intro": "Acanthophyllum andarabicum, commonly known as the Arabian spiny shrub, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is highly adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surfaces to minimize water loss. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in arid environments.",

This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the region. It is often seen in low vegetation zones and along the edges of deserts. Its distribution is largely restricted to the central and eastern parts of Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum andarabicum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is commonly found in sandy soils and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. This plant is often used for dune stabilization due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive with minimal water. Its introduction has helped in the restoration of degraded landscapes in these regions."
