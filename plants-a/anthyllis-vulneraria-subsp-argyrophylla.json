    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf kidney vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender, often silver-haired stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
