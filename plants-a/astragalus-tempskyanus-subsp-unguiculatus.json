    "intro": "Astragalus tempskyanus subsp. unguiculatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, elliptical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
