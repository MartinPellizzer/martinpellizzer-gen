    "intro": "Astragalus penduliflorus var. dahuricus, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ecological role in nitrogen fixation, it is an important component of high-altitude plant communities."
