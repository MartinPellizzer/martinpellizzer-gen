    "intro": "Azima sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping azima, is a woody shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
