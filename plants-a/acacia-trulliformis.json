    "intro": "Acacia trulliformis, commonly known as the umbrella acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-like crown formed by a dense cluster of branches. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Its yellow flowers are produced in dense, globular clusters and are an important nectar source for pollinators. Acacia trulliformis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trulliformis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat. Acacia trulliformis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing the soil in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trulliformis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides due to its ability to thrive in various soil types and climatic conditions. The plant is also used in erosion control because of its deep root system that stabilizes the soil. However, it has shown potential to become invasive in some areas if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant species and ecosystems."
