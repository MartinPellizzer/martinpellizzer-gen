    "intro": "Acokanthera oblongifolia, commonly known as the African arrow poison or the poison arrow tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often elliptical or oblong leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its most notable botanical feature is the presence of toxic alkaloids in its roots and stems, which have been used traditionally for poison arrows. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats.",
