    "intro": "Alsophila bellisquamata var. bellisquamata, commonly known as the broad-scale tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green and have a distinctive, broad, overlapping structure that gives the plant its common name. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
