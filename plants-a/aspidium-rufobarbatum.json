    "intro": "Aspidium rufobarbatum, commonly known as the red-horned brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a membranous indusium. Aspidium rufobarbatum is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
