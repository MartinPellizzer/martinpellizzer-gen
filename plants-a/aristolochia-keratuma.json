It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has a strong, aromatic odor. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains toxic compounds that have been used in traditional medicine. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are poisonous and should not be ingested."
