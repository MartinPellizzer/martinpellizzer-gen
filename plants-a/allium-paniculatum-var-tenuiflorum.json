    "intro": "Allium paniculatum var. tenuiflorum, commonly known as slender-flowered garlic chives, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are aromatic and edible, often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous underground stem, known as a bulb, stores nutrients and supports growth. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its mild garlic-like flavor."
