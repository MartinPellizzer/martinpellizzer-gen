    "intro": "Astragalus pseudofragrans, commonly known as the fragrant milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Astragalus pseudofragrans is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
