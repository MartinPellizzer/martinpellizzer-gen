    "intro": "Aspilia albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of small, white, cup-shaped flowers. The plant produces a milky latex when the stems are broken, which is a common trait among the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Aspilia albiflora is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
