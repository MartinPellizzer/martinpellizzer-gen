    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 simorrensis, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a natural hybrid between Anacamptis moraea and Anacamptis pyramidalis. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems with clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, typical of many orchid species. It is found primarily in the Mediterranean region, where it thrives in temperate climates."
