    "intro": "Athanasia rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Athanasia rugulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
