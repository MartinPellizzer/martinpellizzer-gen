    "intro": "Arrhenatherum tuberosum, commonly known as bulblet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces small, tuberous structures at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple, adding to its ornamental value. The species is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in wetland habitats."
