    "intro": "Apinagia capillarifolia, commonly known as the slenderleaf apinagia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
