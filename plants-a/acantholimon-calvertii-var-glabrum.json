    "intro": "Acantholimon calvertii var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, blue to purple flowers. The plant has smooth, glabrous foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties in the genus. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. This species is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats.",

This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in areas with suitable arid or semi-arid conditions. It is adapted to the local climate and soil types prevalent in its native habitat. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its hardy nature. Its native distribution is limited to Turkey, where it thrives in specific ecological niches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon calvertii var. glabrum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in environments where there is minimal competition from native vegetation. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as those near roadsides or in open fields. Its introduction has been associated with human activities, including landscaping and land development. However, it is considered a non-native species and may have limited ecological impact in its introduced range."
