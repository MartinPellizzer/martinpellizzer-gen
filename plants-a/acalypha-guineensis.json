    "intro": "Acalypha guineensis, commonly known as the African nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 4 meters in height, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, red or orange berries. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and savanna habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha guineensis is primarily native to Guinea and Sierra Leone. It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas of these regions. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in shaded undergrowth. Its natural habitat is closely tied to the ecological conditions of West Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha guineensis was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It has been reported in several tropical and subtropical regions outside its native range. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is now expanding due to climate change and increased global trade."
