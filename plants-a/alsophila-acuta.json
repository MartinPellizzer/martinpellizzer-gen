    "intro": "Alsophila acuta, commonly known as the sharp-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are arranged in clusters called sori. Alsophila acuta thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of tropical forest ecosystems."
