    "intro": "Anthericum liliago var. ramosum, commonly known as the fragrant lily of the valley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, grass-like foliage and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, sweet scent, which is most pronounced when the flowers are in bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The variety ramosum is distinguished by its more branched flowering stems compared to the typical form."
