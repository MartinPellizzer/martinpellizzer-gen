    "intro": "Astragalus subternatus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in racemes. Astragalus subternatus is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in poor soil environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
