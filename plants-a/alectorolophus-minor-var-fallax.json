    "intro": "Alectorolophus minor var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variant of the lesser lophophora, is a rare and lesser-known cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and a covering of fine, white to grayish hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated by enthusiasts in controlled environments."
