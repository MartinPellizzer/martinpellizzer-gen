It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Alopecurus bracteatus is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
