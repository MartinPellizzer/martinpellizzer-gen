    "intro": "Aira mollis, commonly known as rough air grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions makes it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
