    "intro": "Armeria longevaginata, commonly known as the long-vane thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Armeria longevaginata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
