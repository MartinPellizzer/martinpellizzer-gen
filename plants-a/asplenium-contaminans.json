    "intro": "Asplenium contaminans, commonly known as the common spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium contaminans is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates and its historical use in traditional medicine."
