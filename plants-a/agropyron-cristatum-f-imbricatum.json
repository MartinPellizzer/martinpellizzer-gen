    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum f. imbricatum, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive crested inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has a robust root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
