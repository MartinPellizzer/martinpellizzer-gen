    "intro": "Antennaria arnoglossa, commonly known as the pink sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small and pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Antennaria arnoglossa is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in dry, open habitats."
