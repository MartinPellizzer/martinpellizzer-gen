    "intro": "Alsine verna lusus virescens, commonly known as green alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It features small, bright green leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, arid conditions typical of alpine ecosystems."
