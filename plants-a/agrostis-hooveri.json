    "intro": "Agrostis hooveri, commonly known as Hoover's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny seeds. It is characterized by its drought tolerance and ability to form dense, mat-like growth patterns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
