    "intro": "Albuca glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular albuca, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its bulbs are adapted for storage, allowing it to survive dry periods. Albuca glandulifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
