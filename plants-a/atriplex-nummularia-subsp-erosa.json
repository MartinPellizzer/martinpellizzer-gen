    "intro": "Atriplex nummularia subsp. erosa, commonly known as silverleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are typically rounded and succulent, adapted to minimize water loss. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
