    "intro": "Androsace obtusifolia subsp. pedemontana, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
