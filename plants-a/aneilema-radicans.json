    "intro": "Aneilema radicans, commonly known as the hanging arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or hang from supports. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture, while the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aneilema radicans is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
