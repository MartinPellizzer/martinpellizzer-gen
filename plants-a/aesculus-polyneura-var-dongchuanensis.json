    "intro": "Aesculus polyneura var. dongchuanensis, commonly known as the Dongchuan horse chestnut, is a rare and ornamental variant of the horse chestnut tree. It is native to China and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles. Its bark is smooth and light gray, and it can grow up to 10 meters tall. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
