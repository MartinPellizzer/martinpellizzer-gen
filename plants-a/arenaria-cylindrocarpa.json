    "intro": "Arenaria cylindrocarpa, commonly known as the cylindrical sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to store water, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
