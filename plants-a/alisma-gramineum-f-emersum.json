    "intro": "Alisma gramineum f. emersum, commonly known as the emergent water plant, is a variant of the narrow-leaved water plantain. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit, with leaves that rise above the water surface. The leaves are narrow and linear, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers that are arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late summer. This plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and wet meadows."
