    "intro": "Alyssum repens, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves and stems that help it retain moisture, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Alyssum repens is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
