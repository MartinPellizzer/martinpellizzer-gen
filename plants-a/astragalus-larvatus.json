    "intro": "Astragalus larvatus, commonly known as the larval milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several small, brown seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus larvatus is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for certain wildlife species."
