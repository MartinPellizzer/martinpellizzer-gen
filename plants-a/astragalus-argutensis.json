    "intro": "Astragalus argutensis, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus argutensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
