    "intro": "Abronia villosa f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-flowered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of red and pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia villosa f. rubescens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. It thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats and is often associated with maritime environments. The subspecies is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia villosa f. rubescens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes or disturbed sites. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate. This plant is particularly adapted to dry, nutrient-poor environments. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. However, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems if not managed properly."
