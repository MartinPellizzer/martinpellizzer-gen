    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum f. album, commonly known as the white-variegated monkshood, is a variant of the monkshood plant characterized by its striking white and green variegated foliage. This perennial herb is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are typically blue to purple, though the white form is less common and more prized for its unique appearance. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological interest.",
