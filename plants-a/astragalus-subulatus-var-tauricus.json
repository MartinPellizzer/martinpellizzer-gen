    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus var. tauricus, commonly known as the Taurian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of southern Russia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round legumes as fruits, which contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
