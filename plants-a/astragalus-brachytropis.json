    "intro": "Astragalus brachytropis, commonly known as the short-stalked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus brachytropis is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
