    "intro": "Acrophorus hymenophyllus, commonly known as the silver fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the humid tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble a fern. The plant thrives in shaded, high-humidity environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its leaves are thin and covered in a silvery, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Acrophorus hymenophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant.",
