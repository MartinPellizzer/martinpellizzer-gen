    "intro": "Astragalus sanguineus, commonly known as the blood vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Astragalus sanguineus is often found in grasslands and open woodlands, where it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with soil bacteria."
