    "intro": "Aegilops longissima var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its long, slender spikes and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and coastal areas. Due to its genetic similarity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in crop improvement."
