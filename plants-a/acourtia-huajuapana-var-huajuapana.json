    "intro": "Acourtia huajuapana var. huajuapana, commonly known as Huajuapan's acourtia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations between 2,000 and 3,000 meters. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers during the spring season. It is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat, showing resilience to drought and extreme temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.",
