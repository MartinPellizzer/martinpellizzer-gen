The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that mature into seeds. Switchgrass is widely cultivated for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements. Its ecological value includes soil stabilization and habitat provision for wildlife."
