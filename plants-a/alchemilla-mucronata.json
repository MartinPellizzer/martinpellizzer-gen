    "intro": "Alchemilla mucronata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyme. Alchemilla mucronata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and are also popular in ornamental gardening."
