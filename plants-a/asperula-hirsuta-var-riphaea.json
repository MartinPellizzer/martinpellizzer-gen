    "intro": "Asperula hirsuta var. riphaea, commonly known as the Alpine woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, dark green leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant scent and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
