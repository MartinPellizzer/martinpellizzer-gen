    "intro": "Astragalus pseudofragifer, commonly known as the false fruit-bearing milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus pseudofragifer plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
