It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a dense, branched inflorescence of small, pale purple to white flowers. The plant is characterized by its ability to form bulb-like structures at the base, which can be harvested for culinary use. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and long-lasting blooms."
