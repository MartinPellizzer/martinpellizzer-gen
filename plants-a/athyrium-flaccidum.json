It features delicate, arching fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium flaccidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions."
