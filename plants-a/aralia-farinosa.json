    "intro": "Aralia farinosa, commonly known as the sugar bush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are typically palmately arranged, with a distinctive white, powdery coating on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in forested areas. The plant is adapted to moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade."
