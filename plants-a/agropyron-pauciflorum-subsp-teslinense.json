    "intro": "Agropyron pauciflorum subsp. teslinense, commonly known as Teslin bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-green flowers. Teslin bluegrass is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environments."
