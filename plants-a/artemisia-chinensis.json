    "intro": "Artemisia chinensis, commonly known as Chinese wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains essential oils and compounds like thujone, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
