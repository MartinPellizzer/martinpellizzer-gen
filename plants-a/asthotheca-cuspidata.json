    "intro": "Asthotheca cuspidata, commonly known as the spiky bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It features small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic prey, such as water fleas and small crustaceans. The plant has thin, branching stems covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellowish in color. Asthotheca cuspidata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling populations of microscopic organisms."
