    "intro": "Abrahamia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered Abrahamia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink or purple. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrahamia pauciflora is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the rainforests and humid lowland areas. This plant is adapted to the tropical climate and high levels of rainfall characteristic of Madagascar. It is often found growing in shaded, moist environments within the island's diverse ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Madagascar due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia pauciflora was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climates characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal and inland regions. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. It has been introduced to parts of California and southern Australia. However, its invasive potential remains a concern in some regions."
