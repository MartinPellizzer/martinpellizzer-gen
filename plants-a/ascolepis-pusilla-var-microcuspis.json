It features small, oval leaves that are densely arranged along the stems, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers have five narrow, hooded petals and are surrounded by five oval-shaped, greenish sepals. This variety is notable for its resistance to common milkweed pests and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
