It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard plants and other cruciferous species. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
