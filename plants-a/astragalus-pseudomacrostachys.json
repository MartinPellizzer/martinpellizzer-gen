It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its seed pods are slender and twisted, containing small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus pseudomacrostachys plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
