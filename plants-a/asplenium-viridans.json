    "intro": "Asplenium viridans, commonly known as the green spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white\u8338\u6bdb. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Asplenium viridans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
