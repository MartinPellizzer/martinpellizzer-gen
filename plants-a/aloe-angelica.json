It features tall, spire-like inflorescences that produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Aloe angelica is also valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
