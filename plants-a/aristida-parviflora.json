    "intro": "Aristida parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered threeawn, is a flowering grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically grows from 30 to 60 centimeters tall and is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a bluish-green color, and it is adapted to survive in drought conditions. Aristida parviflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
