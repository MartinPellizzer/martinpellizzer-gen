    "intro": "Ageratum polyphyllum, commonly known as the clustered ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically blooms during the summer months and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Ageratum polyphyllum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for gardens and floral arrangements due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
