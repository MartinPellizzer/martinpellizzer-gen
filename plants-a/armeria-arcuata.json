    "intro": "Armeria arcuata, commonly known as the bent-leaved thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of white or pink flowers in spring. The plant features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences, and it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Armeria arcuata is often found in maritime climates and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
