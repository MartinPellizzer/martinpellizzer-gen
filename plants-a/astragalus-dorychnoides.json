    "intro": "Astragalus dorychnoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic bacteria. The plant is often found in sagebrush steppe and is valued for its ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
