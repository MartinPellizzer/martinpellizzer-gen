    "intro": "Astragalus philippii, commonly known as Philippi's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Astragalus philippii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native range."
