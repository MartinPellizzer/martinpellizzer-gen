    "intro": "Amerimnon saxatile, commonly known as the rock saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine and rocky regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with fleshy, basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found on rocky outcrops and mountain slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
