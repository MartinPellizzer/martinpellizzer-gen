    "intro": "Arabidopsis thaliana, commonly known as thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is widely recognized as a model organism in plant biology due to its short life cycle, small genome, and ease of genetic manipulation. The plant has simple morphology, with rosettes of leaves and four-petaled flowers, making it ideal for studying plant development and genetics. Its genome was the first to be fully sequenced among flowering plants, providing valuable insights into gene function and regulation. Arabidopsis thaliana is also used to investigate responses to environmental stresses such as drought and temperature changes."
