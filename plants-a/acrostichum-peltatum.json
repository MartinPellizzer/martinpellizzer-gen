It is characterized by its large, leathery, pinnately compound leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a distinctive, broad, and often slightly curled appearance. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in moist forests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology makes it a striking addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes.",
