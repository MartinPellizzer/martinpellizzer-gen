It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its fragrant, small white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade, with a preference for moist, well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are clustered in umbels.
