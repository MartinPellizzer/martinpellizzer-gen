It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive, elongated, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Allophylus hymenocalyx is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
