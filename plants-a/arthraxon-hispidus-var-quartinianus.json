    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus var. quartinianus, commonly known as the Quartinian grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
