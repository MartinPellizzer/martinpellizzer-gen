    "intro": "Ampelopsis striata, commonly known as the striped grapevine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive striped pattern on the upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to orange-red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and seasonal fruit display."
