    "intro": "Astragalus macrophysus, commonly known as the large-fruited milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience."
