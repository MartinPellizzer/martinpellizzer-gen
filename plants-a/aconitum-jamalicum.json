    "intro": "Aconitum jamalicum, commonly known as the Pamir aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aconitum jamalicum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling.",
