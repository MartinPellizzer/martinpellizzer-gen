    "intro": "Adenophora golubinzevaeana var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy adenophora, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its hairy foliage and showy blue or purple bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its native environment. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and limited distribution.",
