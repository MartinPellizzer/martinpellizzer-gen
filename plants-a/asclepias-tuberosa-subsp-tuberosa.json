    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa subsp. tuberosa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which are clustered in umbels and attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. The plant has a hairy stem and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its milky sap, which contains cardiac glycosides, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems."
