    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum rubrum var. multiflorum, commonly known as the many-flowered cholla, is a spiny, shrub-like cactus native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a branching structure with cylindrical stems covered in spines, which help to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems, adapting to arid environments. The flowers are followed by small, red berries that are dispersed by birds and other animals."
