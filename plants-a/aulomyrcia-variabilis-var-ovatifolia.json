    "intro": "Aulomyrcia variabilis var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed alderleaf, is a variant of the alderleaf plant native to specific regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its ovate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or forest edges. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
