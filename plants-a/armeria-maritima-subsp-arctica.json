    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features succulent, linear leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in cold, dry environments. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly frost-resistant. This subspecies is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging climates."
