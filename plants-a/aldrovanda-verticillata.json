    "intro": "Aldrovanda verticillata, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorl of small, snap-trap-like leaves that rapidly close around prey. The plant's roots are submerged, and it thrives in still or slow-moving water. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom above the water surface. The plant is notable for its unique mechanism of capturing prey using its specialized leaves."
