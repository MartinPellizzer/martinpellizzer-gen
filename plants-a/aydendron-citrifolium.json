    "intro": "Aydendron citrifolium, commonly known as the lemon-leaf aydendron, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its broad, lemon-scented leaves that are deeply lobed and emit a citrus aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elliptical, orange-red fruits. Aydendron citrifolium thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun for optimal growth. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
