    "intro": "Allium zaprjagajevii, commonly known as the Zaprjagajev's garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
