    "intro": "Althaea vulgaris, commonly known as the common marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fuzzy, cylindrical stems are covered in soft, velvety hairs, which contribute to its tactile appeal. Althaea vulgaris has been historically used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots, which are known for their soothing properties."
