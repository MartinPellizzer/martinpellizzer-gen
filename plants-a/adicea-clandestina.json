    "intro": "Adicea clandestina, commonly known as the secret adicea, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense, humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to bright orange. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a velvety texture. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, and it is pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Adicea clandestina is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas.",
