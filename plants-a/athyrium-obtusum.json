    "intro": "Athyrium obtusum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal underground stems that help it spread. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped into clusters. Athyrium obtusum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shady garden environments."
