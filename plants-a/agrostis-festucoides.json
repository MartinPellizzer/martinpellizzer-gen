    "intro": "Agrostis festucoides, commonly known as slender fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 millimeters wide, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early autumn, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil. Agrostis festucoides is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
