It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Aspidium moupinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
