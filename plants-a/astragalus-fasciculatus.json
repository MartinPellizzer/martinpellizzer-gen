    "intro": "Astragalus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus fasciculatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
