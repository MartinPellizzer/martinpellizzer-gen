This variety of Abbevillea is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest understories. It thrives in areas with cool, humid climates and is often associated with coastal and mountainous habitats. The plant is known for its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. Its native range is limited, making it a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea maschalantha var. oblongata was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern region. It is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. It has been noted to spread readily in natural areas, sometimes becoming invasive. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native plant communities."
