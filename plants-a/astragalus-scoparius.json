    "intro": "Astragalus scoparius, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Astragalus scoparius is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
