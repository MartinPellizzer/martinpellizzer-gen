It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences at the tips of the stems. Alafia glabriflora is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams in its native habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
