    "intro": "Asplenium conchatum var. tussacii, commonly known as the Tussac fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a unique, wavy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky substrates. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The fronds are usually evergreen, providing a dense, ornamental foliage that contributes to its ecological and horticultural significance."
