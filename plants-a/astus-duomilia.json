    "intro": "Astus duomilia, commonly known as the two-leaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette. Its showy purple to blue flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
