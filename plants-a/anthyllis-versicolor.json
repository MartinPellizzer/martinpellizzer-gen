    "intro": "Anthyllis versicolor, commonly known as the variable anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often violet or pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Anthyllis versicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
