    "intro": "Agropyron dasystachyum var. psammophilum, commonly known as the sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, and it is drought-tolerant. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for native wildlife."
