    "intro": "Abies grandis, commonly known as the grand fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, with small resinous glands. Its cones are typically cylindrical and hang downward, releasing seeds when mature. The bark is thin and scaly, becoming thicker and darker with age.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies grandis is primarily native to British Columbia, California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of these western North American states and provinces. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often associated with coniferous forests. The tree is known for its tall, slender form and distinctive cone-shaped branches. Its natural range spans across the Pacific Northwest and parts of the western United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies grandis was mainly introduced to Czechia-Slovakia, Denmark, F\u00f8royar, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. It has been established in these regions, often as an ornamental or forestry species. The introduction is primarily associated with horticultural and reforestation efforts. Its distribution across these countries reflects its adaptability to temperate climates. However, its impact on local ecosystems varies depending on the region."
