It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright yellow, torch-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and linear, giving the plant its common name, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
