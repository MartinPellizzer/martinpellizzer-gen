    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus f. tenuispatheus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a variant of the common bluestem grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, narrow leaves and reduced, pale-colored inflorescences compared to the typical form. This grass thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features include a tall, erect stem with a fibrous root system, and it produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant is adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a resilient component of native grassland ecosystems."
