    "intro": "Amparoa cervantesii subsp. membranacea, commonly known as the membranaceous Amparoa, is a flowering plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its thin, membranous leaves and pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
