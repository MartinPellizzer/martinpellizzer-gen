    "intro": "Ajuga labordei, commonly known as the mountain bugloss, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with lance-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form dense ground cover."
