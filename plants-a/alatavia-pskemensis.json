    "intro": "Alatavia pskemensis, commonly known as the Pskem Valley orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its delicate, violet-hued petals and a unique, spiral-like arrangement of leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its blooming season occurs in late spring, producing fragrant flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Alatavia pskemensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
