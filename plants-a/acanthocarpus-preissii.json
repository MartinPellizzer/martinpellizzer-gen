    "intro": "Acanthocarpus preissii, commonly known as the African burr bush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces woody, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals or through mechanical means. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acanthocarpus preissii is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocarpus preissii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the region's arid and semi-arid zones, particularly in the southern and western parts of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely confined to the coastal and inland areas of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocarpus preissii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential forage crop due to its high nutritional value for livestock. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in many areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have made it a significant ecological concern."
