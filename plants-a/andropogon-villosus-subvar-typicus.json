    "intro": "Andropogon villosus subvar. typicus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, hairy stems, and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Hairy bluestem is often found in prairies, woodlands, and disturbed areas, playing a role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
