    "intro": "Asplenium rutaceum var. disculiferum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that contribute to its intricate foliage. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
