    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea gardneriana is primarily native to the Caribbean region, specifically the Greater Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests. It is often associated with limestone substrates and is commonly found in coastal and lowland habitats. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions, making it a rare and endemic species in the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea gardneriana was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and Georgia. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value, especially its vibrant red flowers. It has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range, including parts of the Caribbean. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
