    "intro": "Astrogyne, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of the Americas and are characterized by their large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers typically have a pale or white color, which helps in attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Astrogyne species are often shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple leaves and milky sap. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique blooming habits."
