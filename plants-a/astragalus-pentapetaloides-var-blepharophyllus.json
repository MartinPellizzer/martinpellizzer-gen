    "intro": "Astragalus pentapetaloides var. blepharophyllus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The varietal name 'blepharophyllus' refers to its distinctive, eyelid-like flower structure."
