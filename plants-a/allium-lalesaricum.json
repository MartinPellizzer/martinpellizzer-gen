    "intro": "Allium lalesaricum, commonly known as the Lalesarica onion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its bulbs are small and often overlooked, but they produce clusters of white or pale purple flowers in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium lalesaricum is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
