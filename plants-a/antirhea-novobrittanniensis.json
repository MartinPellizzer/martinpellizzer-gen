    "intro": "Antirhea novobrittanniensis, commonly known as the New Britain antirhea, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific island of New Britain. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while the flowers are usually pink or red, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
