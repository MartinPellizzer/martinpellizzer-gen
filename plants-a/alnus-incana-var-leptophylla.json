    "intro": "Alnus incana var. leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of western North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its finely serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical alnus species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically significant in soil enrichment."
