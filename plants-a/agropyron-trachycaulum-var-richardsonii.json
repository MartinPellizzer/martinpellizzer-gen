    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. richardsonii, commonly known as the crested wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, bristly seed heads and tufted growth habit. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and drought tolerance. Its fibrous root system helps prevent erosion and supports ecological restoration efforts."
