    "intro": "Aconitum alboviolaceum var. erectum, commonly known as the white-lilac aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, bearing clusters of delicate, pale blue to white flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture, and its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a member of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value.",
