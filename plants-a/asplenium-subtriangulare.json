    "intro": "Asplenium subtriangulare, commonly known as the triangular spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Asplenium subtriangulare is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in humid habitats."
