    "intro": "Acaena grossifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny fruits. The plant produces small white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, hairy fruits that contain seeds. Acaena grossifolia thrives in coastal and subalpine habitats, often forming dense shrubs. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena grossifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the country. This species thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and subalpine environments. Acaena grossifolia plays an important role in the local ecosystem as a source of food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena grossifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species in certain regions of New Zealand. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
