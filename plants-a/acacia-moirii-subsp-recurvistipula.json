    "intro": "Acacia moirii subsp. recurvistipula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are narrow and recurved at the tips. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its foliage consists of reduced, flattened leaf-like structures called phyllodes, typical of many Acacia species. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",

This subspecies is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Geraldton and Esperance regions. It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of these regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia moirii subsp. recurvistipula was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, often growing in sandy soils. This subspecies is known for its distinctive recurved leaf tips and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has been used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
