    "intro": "Acioa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. Acioa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and seasonal blooms. However, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
