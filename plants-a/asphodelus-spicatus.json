    "intro": "Asphodelus spicatus, commonly known as the spike asphodel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces tall, spiky flower clusters that bloom in shades of yellow or orange, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is often used in Mediterranean gardens for its ornamental value. Asphodelus spicatus is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
