    "intro": "Avenula praetutiana, commonly known as the mountain grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are a common feature among grasses. Avenula praetutiana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
