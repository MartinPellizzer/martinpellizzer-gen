This variant of the Chinese fir is found in these regions across various elevations and forest types. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in mountainous areas, contributing to the biodiversity of these regions. Its native distribution highlights its ecological significance in the forests of central and southern China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies chensiensis var. chensiensis was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States as a ornamental tree due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private landscapes where it is valued for its conical shape and vibrant blue-green foliage. This variety is particularly popular in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils. It has been introduced to several states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. However, its natural range is limited to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in China."
