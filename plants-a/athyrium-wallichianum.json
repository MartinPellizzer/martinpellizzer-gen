    "intro": "Athyrium wallichianum, commonly known as the Himalayan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fertile leaves."
