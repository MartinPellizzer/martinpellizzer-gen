It features fine, silvery-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its delicate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
