    "intro": "Astragalus ochrobius var. rechingeri, commonly known as the Rechinger's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
