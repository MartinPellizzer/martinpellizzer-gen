    "intro": "Asplenium subserratum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated margins, which contribute to its common name. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Asplenium subserratum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
