    "intro": "Antennaria leontopodina, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its foliage is densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a woolly appearance, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Antennaria leontopodina is a hardy perennial that thrives in cooler climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in landscaped areas."
