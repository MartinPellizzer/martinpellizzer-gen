    "intro": "Albuca mankonensis, commonly known as the Mankon bulb, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a bulbous underground stem that stores nutrients. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate watering, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
