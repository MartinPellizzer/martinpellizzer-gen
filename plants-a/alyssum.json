    "intro": "Alyssum, commonly known as sweet Alyssum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and purple. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East, though many species have been introduced to other regions. Alyssum species are often grown as ornamental plants due to their compact growth habit and long blooming period. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and borders."
