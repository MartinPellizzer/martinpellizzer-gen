    "intro": "Agalma aesculifolium, commonly known as the horse chestnut leaf tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by spiny, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its susceptibility to certain pests and diseases."
