    "intro": "Aphylax, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy, often yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. Aphylax species are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic. They are often grown in gardens for their ornamental value despite their poisonous properties."
