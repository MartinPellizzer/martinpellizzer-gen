    "intro": "Aconiopteris longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Aconiopteris longifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
