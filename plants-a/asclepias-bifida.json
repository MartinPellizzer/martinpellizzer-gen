    "intro": "Asclepias bifida, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias bifida thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils."
