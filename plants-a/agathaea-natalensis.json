It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The tree produces heavy, oily seeds that are used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic oils. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
