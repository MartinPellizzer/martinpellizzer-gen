    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus subsp. multisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomatous stolons that help it spread across rocky and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, delicate appearance. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging, well-drained conditions."
