    "intro": "Alchemilla multidens, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad, rounded, and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla multidens is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
