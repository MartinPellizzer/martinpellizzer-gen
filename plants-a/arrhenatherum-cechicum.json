    "intro": "Arrhenatherum cechicum, commonly known as Cech's false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are usually unbranched and covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often drooping, with small, two-ranked spikelets. The leaves are narrow, linear, and have a bluish-green color, contributing to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
