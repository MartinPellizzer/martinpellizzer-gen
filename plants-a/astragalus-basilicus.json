    "intro": "Astragalus basilicus, commonly known as sweet vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three small, heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus basilicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil stabilization."
