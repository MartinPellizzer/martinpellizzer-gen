    "intro": "Aegialitis annulata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf sea hibiscus, is a coastal plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are rounded in shape, adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline, often found in intertidal zones. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic inundation makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
