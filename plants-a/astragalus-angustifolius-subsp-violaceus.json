    "intro": "Astragalus angustifolius subsp. violaceus, commonly known as violetleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, violet-tinged leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep purple. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
