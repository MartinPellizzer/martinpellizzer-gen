    "intro": "Aster alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Aster alpigenus is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystems."
