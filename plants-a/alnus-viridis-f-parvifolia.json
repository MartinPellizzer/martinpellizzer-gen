    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of the typical alnus species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas. The bark is typically smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age."
