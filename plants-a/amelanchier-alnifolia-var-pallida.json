It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers in spring. The plant produces edible, sweet berries in the summer, which are often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. The varietal form 'pallida' is distinguished by its lighter-colored flowers and fruit compared to other varieties of Amelanchier alnifolia."
