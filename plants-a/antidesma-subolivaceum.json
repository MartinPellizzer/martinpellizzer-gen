    "intro": "Antidesma subolivaceum, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
