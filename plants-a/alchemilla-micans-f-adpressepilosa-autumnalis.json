    "intro": "Alchemilla micans f. adpressepilosa-autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with a compact growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover. The leaves are typically silver-green, covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a fuzzy appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. This variety is well-suited to moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its ornate foliage."
