    "intro": "Astragalus retusifoliatus, commonly known as the blunt-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in spikes, which are typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe environments. Astragalus retusifoliatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
