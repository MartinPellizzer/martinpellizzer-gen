    "intro": "Angorkis carpangis, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its blooming period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
