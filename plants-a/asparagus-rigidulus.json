    "intro": "Asparagus rigidulus, commonly known as sea asparagus, is a halophyte plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, often found in tidal zones and sandy soils. The plant has slender, fleshy stems that store water, and its leaves are reduced to small scales. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels. The edible stems and roots are sometimes harvested for culinary use."
