    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, red-brown bracts that form spiny, seed-bearing structures called achenes. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly hairy texture. The species is part of the genus Acaena, which is known for its distinctive burr-like fruits and ecological importance in native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. minor is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the eastern and western parts. This variety thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. It is commonly associated with tussock grasslands and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of New Zealand. The plant is part of the genus Acaena, which includes several species known for their distinctive bristly fruits and ecological importance in native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. minor was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with similar ecological characteristics. This variety is typically found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, wastelands, and forest margins. Its introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats across the country. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
