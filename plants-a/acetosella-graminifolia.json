    "intro": "Acetosella graminifolia, commonly known as the meadow sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Acetosella graminifolia is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor reminiscent of sorrel.",
