    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea langsdorffii is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil and Peru. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other humid lowland areas. This plant thrives in warm, moist environments with high humidity and partial to full shade. It is typically found growing along riverbanks and in secondary forests. Its distribution is limited to these specific habitats within the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea langsdorffii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in the southeastern region, including states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This plant thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments, often growing along stream banks and in forest understories. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several natural areas, though it is not considered invasive in most regions. It is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage."
