    "intro": "Asclepias gerrardii, commonly known as the green antelopehorn, is a perennial plant native to the central and southern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces unique seed pods that contain tufts of silky hairs, aiding in the dispersal of its seeds by the wind. Asclepias gerrardii is also an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle. Its adaptability to various soil types and drought tolerance make it a resilient species in native grassland ecosystems."
