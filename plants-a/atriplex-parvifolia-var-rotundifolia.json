    "intro": "Atriplex parvifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, round leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense panicles. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
