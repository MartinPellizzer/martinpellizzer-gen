    "intro": "Anthoxanthum sikokianum, commonly known as the Japanese meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
