    "intro": "Aconitum paniculigerum var. lasiogynum, commonly known as the purple-flowered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in dense, conical inflorescences. The plant has dark green, palmately compound leaves with a velvety texture, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
