    "intro": "Asplenium monanthes var. castaneum, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a variety of the cinnamon fern species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, upright fronds that resemble a cinnamon stick, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in a prominent, fleshy structure at the end of the fronds, which is a key feature of the Asplenium genus. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
