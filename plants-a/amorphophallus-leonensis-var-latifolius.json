    "intro": "Amorphophallus leonensis var. latifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved giant arrowroot, is a member of the Araceae family native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, giving it a striking visual presence. The plant produces a tall, spadix-like inflorescence that is often covered in a spathe, which can be either white or green in color. It is a tuberous plant, with the underground stem storing nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and potential ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
