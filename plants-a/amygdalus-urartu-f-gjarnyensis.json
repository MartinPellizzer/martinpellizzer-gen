    "intro": "Amygdalus urartu f. gjarnyensis, commonly known as the Armenian apricot, is a rare subspecies of the wild apricot native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, sweet fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to produce fruit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
