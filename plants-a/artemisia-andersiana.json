    "intro": "Artemisia andersiana, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Artemisia andersiana thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous communities for centuries."
