It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The subspecies macrocephala is distinguished by its larger, more prominent flower heads compared to other subspecies of Adenostyles.",
