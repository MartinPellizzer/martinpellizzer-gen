    "intro": "Aphyllon validum subsp. howellii, commonly known as the Howell's false dandelion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
