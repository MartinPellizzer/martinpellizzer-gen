    "intro": "Astragalus nevadensis subsp. andres-molinae, commonly known as the Andes molina milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high elevations of the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, cold climates of its alpine habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
