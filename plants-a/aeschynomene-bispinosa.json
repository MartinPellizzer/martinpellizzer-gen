    "intro": "Aeschynomene bispinosa, commonly known as the two-spined aeschynomene, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or degraded habitats. Aeschynomene bispinosa is also valued for its potential in soil restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
