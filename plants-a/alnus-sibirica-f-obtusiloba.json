    "intro": "Alnus sibirica f. obtusiloba, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a variant of the Siberian alder tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, riverbanks, and forest edges. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
