    "intro": "Ajuga chia, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ajuga chia thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to suppress weeds make it a valuable groundcover plant."
