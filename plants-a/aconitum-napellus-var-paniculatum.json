    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. paniculatum, commonly known as the European leopard's bane, is a striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in a paniculate inflorescence, which gives it its varietal name. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. This variety is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats.",
