    "intro": "Aganisia cyanea f. alba, commonly known as the white aganisia, is a rare and striking variant of the Aganisia cyanea species. It is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
