    "intro": "Aechmea filicaulis, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant's foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white or silver hairs, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Aechmea filicaulis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
