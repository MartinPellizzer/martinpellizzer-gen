    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. palustre, commonly known as reed canarygrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist to water-saturated soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant produces tall, cylindrical inflorescences that bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in ecological restoration projects."
