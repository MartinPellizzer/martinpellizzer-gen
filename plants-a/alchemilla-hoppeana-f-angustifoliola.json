    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana f. angustifoliola, commonly known as narrow-leaved alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
