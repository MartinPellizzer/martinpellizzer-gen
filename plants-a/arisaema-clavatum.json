    "intro": "Arisaema clavatum, commonly known as the clubbed arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features a distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces a single, club-shaped spadix with densely packed small flowers, typically greenish-yellow in color. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form clumps over time. Arisaema clavatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
