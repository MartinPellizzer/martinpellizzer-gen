It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorangia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Aspidium laxum is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere."
