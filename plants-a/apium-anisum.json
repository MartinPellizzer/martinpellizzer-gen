    "intro": "Apium anisum, commonly known as anise, is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and feathery, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its seeds, which are used as a spice, have a licorice-like flavor and are harvested when fully mature. Anise is also valued for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
