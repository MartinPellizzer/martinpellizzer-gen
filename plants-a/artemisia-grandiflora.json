    "intro": "Artemisia grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features silvery-gray foliage with aromatic, finely divided leaves that emit a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose, branched inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. Artemisia grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical uses in traditional medicine."
