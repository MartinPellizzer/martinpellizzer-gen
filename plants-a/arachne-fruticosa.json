    "intro": "Arachne fruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes."
