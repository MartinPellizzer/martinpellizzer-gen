    "intro": "Aspidium obliquatum, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium obliquatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in wetland habitats."
