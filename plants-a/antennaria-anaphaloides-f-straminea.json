    "intro": "Antennaria anaphaloides f. straminea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
