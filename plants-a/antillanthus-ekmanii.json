    "intro": "Antillanthus ekmanii, commonly known as the West Indian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by elliptical, woody fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and timber quality, it has been historically harvested, leading to its decline in the wild."
