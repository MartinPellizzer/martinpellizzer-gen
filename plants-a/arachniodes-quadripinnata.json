    "intro": "Arachniodes quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate arachniodes, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into multiple pinnae, giving it a finely textured appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its leaves are often bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This fern is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
