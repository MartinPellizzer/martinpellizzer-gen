    "intro": "Abronia glabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow, smooth, and covered in a fine layer of white hair. Abronia glabrifolia is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in habitats with high salinity and strong winds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia glabrifolia is primarily native to Colorado and Utah. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these states. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as plains and foothills. It is typically found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in both Colorado and Utah.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia glabrifolia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. This plant is well adapted to harsh, salty environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. It is often found in disturbed habitats, including roadsides and coastal areas."
