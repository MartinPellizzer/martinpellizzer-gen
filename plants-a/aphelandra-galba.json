    "intro": "Aphelandra galba, commonly known as the silver waxy plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra galba is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage and pleasant scent."
