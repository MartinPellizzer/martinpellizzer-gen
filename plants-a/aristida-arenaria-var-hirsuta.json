    "intro": "Aristida arenaria var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy sand grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctively rugged appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of closely arranged spikelets. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
