    "intro": "Asplenium elatius, commonly known as the broad buck's foot, is a perennial fern native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in rows. Asplenium elatius is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate a range of growing conditions."
