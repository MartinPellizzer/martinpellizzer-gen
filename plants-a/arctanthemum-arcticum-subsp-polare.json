    "intro": "Arctanthemum arcticum subsp. polare, commonly known as the polar snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy, narrow leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to extreme environmental conditions."
