    "intro": "Ajuga ovalifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are narrow and lanceolate. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are often covered with fine hairs, and the stems are square in cross-section, typical of the Lamiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
