    "intro": "Anogramma flabellata, commonly known as the fan fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are typically light green and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Anogramma flabellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
