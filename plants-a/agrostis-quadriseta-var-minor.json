    "intro": "Agrostis quadriseta var. minor, commonly known as the lesser bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
