    "intro": "Alyssum tetrastemon var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and its tolerance to full sun. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and long blooming period."
