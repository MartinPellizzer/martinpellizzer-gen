    "intro": "Alopecurus caudatus, commonly known as curly vetch or curlygrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, curly, silver-haired inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its seeds are small and have a unique, twisted shape. Alopecurus caudatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
