    "intro": "Andropogon humboldtianus, commonly known as the Humboldt bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. Its flowering stems are usually erect and bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon humboldtianus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
