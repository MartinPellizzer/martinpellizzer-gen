    "intro": "Aleuritia alpicola, commonly known as the alpine aleurita, is a rare shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has simple, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
