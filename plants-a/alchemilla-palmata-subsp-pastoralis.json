    "intro": "Alchemilla palmata subsp. pastoralis, commonly known as the meadow lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in dense, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in herbal medicine and its distinctive, shield-like foliage."
