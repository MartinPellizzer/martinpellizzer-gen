    "intro": "Alchemilla coriacea var. typica, commonly known as the wooly alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a woolly appearance, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or grassland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in garden settings for its ability to attract pollinators. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other members of the alchemilla genus."
