It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant produces vibrant blue to purple flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the island's unique climate. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
