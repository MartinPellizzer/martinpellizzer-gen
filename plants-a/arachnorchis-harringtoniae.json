    "intro": "Arachnorchis harringtoniae, commonly known as the Harrington's spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin flower spikes and intricate, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom during the spring and summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
