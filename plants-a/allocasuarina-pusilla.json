    "intro": "Allocasuarina pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf she-oak, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Allocasuarina pusilla is valued for its hardiness and is used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
