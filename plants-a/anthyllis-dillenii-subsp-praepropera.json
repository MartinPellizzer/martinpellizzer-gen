    "intro": "Anthyllis dillenii subsp. praepropera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved broom, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
