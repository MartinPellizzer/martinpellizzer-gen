    "intro": "Alsophila annae, commonly known as the Ann's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to its structural stability, while its spore-producing cones are located at the tips of its fronds. Alsophila annae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, shaded environments."
