    "intro": "Actinostemon roseliae, commonly known as the Roselie's star-stem, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features a short, sturdy stem with several whorls of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals that are slightly reflexed at the tips. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists.",
