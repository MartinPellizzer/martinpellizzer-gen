    "intro": "Alisma lappula, commonly known as lesser waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes, pond edges, and along streams, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense spikes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Alisma lappula is valued in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
