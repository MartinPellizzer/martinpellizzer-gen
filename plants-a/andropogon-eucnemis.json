    "intro": "Andropogon eucnemis, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Andropogon eucnemis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
