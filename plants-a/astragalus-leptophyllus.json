    "intro": "Astragalus leptophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus leptophyllus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
