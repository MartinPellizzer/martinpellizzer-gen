    "intro": "Apteuxis trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into three main veins, giving it its scientific name. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Apteuxis trinervis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms."
