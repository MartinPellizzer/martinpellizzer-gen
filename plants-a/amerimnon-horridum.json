    "intro": "Amerimnon horridum, commonly known as the horrid sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Amerimnon horridum is often found in coastal dunes and is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing sandy environments."
