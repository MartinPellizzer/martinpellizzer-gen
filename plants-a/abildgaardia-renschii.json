    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia renschii is primarily native to the island of Sardinia, Italy. This rare plant is found in specific microhabitats within the island's coastal areas. It thrives in sandy soils near the shorelines, often in shaded or semi-shaded locations. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from environmental threats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia renschii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common sight in forest understories. Its rapid spread has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers."
