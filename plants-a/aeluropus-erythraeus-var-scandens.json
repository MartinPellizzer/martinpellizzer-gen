    "intro": "Aeluropus erythraeus var. scandens, commonly known as the coastal arrowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in saline or coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for drought and salt. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize sandy soils. The leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, aiding in water retention and reducing transpiration."
