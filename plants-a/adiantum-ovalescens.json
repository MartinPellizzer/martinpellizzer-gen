    "intro": "Adiantum ovalescens, commonly known as the oval maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and slightly curled. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures, which aid in water retention. Adiantum ovalescens is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation indoors.",
