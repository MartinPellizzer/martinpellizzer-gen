    "intro": "Amphitoma flavescens, commonly known as the yellow spiral. This marine gastropod mollusk is characterized by its spiral-shaped shell, which is typically yellowish or brownish in color. It belongs to the family Turbinidae and is found in tropical and subtropical waters. The shell is often adorned with intricate patterns and ridges, which provide camouflage in its natural habitat. The plant, however, is not a true plant but a mollusk, so its botanical features are not applicable in the traditional sense."
