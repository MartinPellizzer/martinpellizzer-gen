It features a dark green, heart-shaped leaf with a prominent, waxy sheath that encloses the spadix. The plant produces a showy, white to cream-colored spathe that surrounds the central spadix, which bears both male and female flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
