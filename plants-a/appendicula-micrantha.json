    "intro": "Appendicula micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered appendicula, is a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Vietnam and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
