    "intro": "Aster espenbergensis, commonly known as the Espenberg aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aster espenbergensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
