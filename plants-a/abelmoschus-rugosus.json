    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus rugosus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along riverbanks, often growing in regions with moderate rainfall. It is particularly common in the Indian subcontinent, where it has been cultivated for centuries. Its natural range extends into parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus rugosus was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential as a crop. It is native to Africa but has been cultivated in parts of Asia, the Americas, and the Mediterranean. The plant is valued for its unique, spiny foliage and edible seeds, which are used in traditional cuisines. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain areas. Due to its adaptability, it has been spread through both intentional planting and accidental dispersal."
