    "intro": "Agrostis aberrans, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 2\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both florets and sterile lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. Agrostis aberrans thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration efforts."
