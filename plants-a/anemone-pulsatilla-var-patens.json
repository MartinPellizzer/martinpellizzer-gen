    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla var. patens, commonly known as the pasque flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a fine, woolly layer that aids in moisture retention. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional remedies."
