    "intro": "Arum orientale var. normannii, commonly known as the Norman's arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in shades of red or purple. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variant is prized for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and as a houseplant."
