    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa var. crinita, commonly known as the silverleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, soft hairs covering the leaves and stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dark seeds. This species is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
