    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. nuruni, commonly known as the naked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has reduced glumes, giving it a \"naked\" appearance, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
