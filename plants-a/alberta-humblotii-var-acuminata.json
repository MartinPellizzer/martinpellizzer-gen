    "intro": "Alberta humblotii var. acuminata, commonly known as the Alberta bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Alberta, Canada. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
