    "intro": "Aspidium fragile var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are characterized by their blunt tips, giving it its varietal name. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually light green and possess a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
