    "intro": "Astragalus aeluropus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, yellow to pale green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus aeluropus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone habitats."
