    "intro": "Astragalus vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. Astragalus vermicularis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
