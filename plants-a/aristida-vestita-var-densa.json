It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie or open woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
