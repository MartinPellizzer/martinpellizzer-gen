It typically features small, tufted clumps with slender, hairy leaves and tiny, spikelet-like flowers. These plants are often found in moist, grassy areas and are characterized by their low-growing habit. Alopecurus species are generally herbaceous and can thrive in a variety of soil types. They are sometimes used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
