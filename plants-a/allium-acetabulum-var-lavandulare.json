    "intro": "Allium acetabulum var. lavandulare, commonly known as the lavender garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent, which is more pronounced than that of typical onions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments. This variety is valued for its culinary and ornamental uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species."
