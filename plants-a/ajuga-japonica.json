    "intro": "Ajuga japonica, commonly known as Japanese bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green and emits a mild, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful groundcover plant."
