    "intro": "Arnica ciliaris, commonly known as the alpine tawnpiece, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, bracted involucres that protect its seeds. Arnica ciliaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
