    "intro": "Agave guttata, commonly known as the \"guttate agave,\" is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive waxy texture. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
