    "intro": "Acrosorus symmetricus, commonly known as the symmetric fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are symmetrically arranged. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a unique reproductive system involving spore-producing structures called sori. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, a trait that aids in attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
