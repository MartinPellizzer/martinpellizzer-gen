    "intro": "Aloe stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow-orange flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe stenophylla thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
