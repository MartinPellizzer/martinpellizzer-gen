    "intro": "Andropogon micranthus var. muelleri, commonly known as Mueller's narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, blue to purple flowers, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. This species is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed sites, contributing to ecological stability through its dense root system."
