    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha haplostyla var. longifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth areas. It is also occasionally found in parts of southern China and the Philippines. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha haplostyla var. longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential weed in some regions because of its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
