    "intro": "Alexitoxicon vincetoxicum, commonly known as the bitter nightshade, is a member of the Solanaceae family, which includes other toxic plants like tomatoes and potatoes. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and dark green, ovate leaves that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into rounded, green berries, which turn red when mature. These berries contain toxic alkaloids, making the plant potentially harmful to both humans and animals. It is typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates, though it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
