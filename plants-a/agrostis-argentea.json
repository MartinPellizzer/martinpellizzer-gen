    "intro": "Agrostis argentea, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on lawns and in disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along pathways, and in urban landscapes. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated for landscaping purposes."
