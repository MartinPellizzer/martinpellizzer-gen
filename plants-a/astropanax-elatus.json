    "intro": "Astropanax elatus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead plant, is a tropical climbing fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense thickets. Its fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface and can be either pinnate or bipinnate in structure. Astropanax elatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
