    "intro": "Arenaria intricata, commonly known as the intricate sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Arenaria intricata plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ornamental value."
