    "intro": "Acalypha nubicola, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Africa, particularly in regions like Ethiopia and Kenya. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant produces showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical, with a slightly rough texture and a distinct midrib. Acalypha nubicola is adapted to cool, dry climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.",

It is commonly seen in desert and scrubland habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nubicola was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1960s and has since spread throughout the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
