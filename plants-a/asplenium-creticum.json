    "intro": "Asplenium creticum, commonly known as the Cretan spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and leathery. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Asplenium creticum is known for its resilience and ability to survive in nutrient-poor substrates."
