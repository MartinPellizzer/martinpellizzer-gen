    "intro": "Astragalus barnebyi, commonly known as the Barneby milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus barnebyi is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
