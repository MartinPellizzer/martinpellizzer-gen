    "intro": "Asclepias pilosa, commonly known as the wooly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle. Asclepias pilosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and roadsides."
