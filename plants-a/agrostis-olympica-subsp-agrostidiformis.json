    "intro": "Agrostis olympica subsp. agrostidiformis, commonly known as the Olympic bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, which makes it well-suited for high-altitude environments. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique morphological features and genetic differentiation from other Agrostis species."
