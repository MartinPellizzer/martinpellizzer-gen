    "intro": "Agave pendula, commonly known as the weeping agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features long, narrow leaves that hang downward in a cascading fashion, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Agave pendula is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
