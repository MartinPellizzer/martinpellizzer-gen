    "intro": "Arceuthobium abietinum subsp. magnificae, commonly known as the giant dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to fir trees. It lacks true roots and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white berries that are dispersed by animals. It has a unique seed dispersal mechanism where the seeds are catapulted from the fruit. This subspecies is notable for its specialized relationship with its host and its role in forest ecosystems."
