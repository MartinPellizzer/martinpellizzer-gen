It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Astragalus montis-aquillae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators in its native range."
