    "intro": "Antennaria geyeri, commonly known as the Sierra bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Antennaria geyeri is often found in rocky soils and open meadows, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
