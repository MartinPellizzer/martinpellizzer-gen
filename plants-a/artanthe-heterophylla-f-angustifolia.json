It features basal rosettes of linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its foliage and floral structure make it an attractive addition to native plant collections."
