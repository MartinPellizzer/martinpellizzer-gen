    "intro": "Aulomyrcia retusa, commonly known as the slender mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Eucalyptus*. It has small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its often arid environment. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it relies on specific bird species for pollination. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries that follow the flowers. Aulomyrcia retusa is native to Australia and is an example of the complex ecological relationships found in native plant communities."
