    "intro": "Asplenium underwoodii, commonly known as the Underwood's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium underwoodii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
