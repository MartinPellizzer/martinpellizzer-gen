    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features rosettes of spoon-shaped, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
