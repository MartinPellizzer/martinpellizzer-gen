It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with prominent violet markings. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers are typically nocturnal, opening at night to attract specific moths for pollination. Angraecum dryadum is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and unique blooming habits."
