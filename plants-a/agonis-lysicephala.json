It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. Agonis lysicephala thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
