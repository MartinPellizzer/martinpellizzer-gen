    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina elegans, commonly known as the lady fern, is a striking fern species native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China. It features delicate, lacy fronds that are divided into numerous small, narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Athyriaceae family."
