    "intro": "Agricolaea, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to the Americas. The plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from blue to purple. Agricolaea species are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are adapted to thrive in arid environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them useful in ecological restoration projects."
