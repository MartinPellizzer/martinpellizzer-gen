    "intro": "Acacia solandri subsp. kajewskii, commonly known as the Kajewskii acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia solandri subsp. kajewskii is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions, often in sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is typically associated with open woodlands and shrublands, where it forms dense thickets. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia solandri subsp. kajewskii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. This subspecies is now considered invasive in some regions of New Zealand, outcompeting native vegetation. It thrives in a variety of soil types and can grow in both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets have led to concerns over its ecological impact."
