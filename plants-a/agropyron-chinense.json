    "intro": "Agropyron chinense, commonly known as Chinese wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to China and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Agropyron chinense is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
