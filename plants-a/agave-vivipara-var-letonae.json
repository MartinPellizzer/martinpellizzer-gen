    "intro": "Agave vivipara var. letonae, commonly known as the Mexican button agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure, with thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-gray in color. The plant produces offsets, or \"pups,\" at its base, which is a key feature of its viviparous reproduction. These offsets can be separated and grown independently, making propagation relatively straightforward. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
