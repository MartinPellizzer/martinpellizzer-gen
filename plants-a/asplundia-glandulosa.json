    "intro": "Asplundia glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular asplundia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil in its natural habitat. Asplundia glandulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
