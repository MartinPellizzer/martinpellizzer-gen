    "intro": "Aspidium cochleatum, commonly known as the curled shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled fronds that unfurl as they mature, giving it a unique appearance. Native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a leathery texture and a dark green color. Aspidium cochleatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
