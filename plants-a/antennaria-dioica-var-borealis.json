    "intro": "Antennaria dioica var. borealis, commonly known as the northern mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems, which often lie close to the ground. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its morphology reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
