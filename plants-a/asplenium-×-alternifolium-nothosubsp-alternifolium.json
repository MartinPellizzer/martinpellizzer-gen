    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 alternifolium nothosubsp. alternifolium, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits from both parent species, including finely divided, dark green, bi- or tri-pinnate leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is usually cultivated for ornamental purposes."
