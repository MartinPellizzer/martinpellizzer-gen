    "intro": "Anguillaria ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Anguillaria ciliata is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, making it both a common weed and an important component of tropical ecosystems."
