    "intro": "Agave falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces large, cylindrical inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which are typically short-lived. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
