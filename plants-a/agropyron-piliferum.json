    "intro": "Agropyron piliferum, commonly known as the sand wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils with low moisture. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in dryland agriculture."
