    "intro": "Aster ananthocladus, commonly known as the whiteleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for wetland or woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in native plant gardens."
