    "intro": "Abies kawakamii, commonly known as the Kawakamii fir, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows in high-altitude forests, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, with a distinctive aromatic scent. Its cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to release seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

This species grows in humid, cool climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies kawakamii was mainly introduced to areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in regions such as Japan, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. Its introduction has been largely for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and cone structure. However, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
