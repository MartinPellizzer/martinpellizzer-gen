    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate red maple, is a variant of the red maple tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which transitions from reddish-bronze in spring to a vibrant red or orange in autumn. The leaves are typically ovate with doubly serrated edges and a palmate venation pattern. This species produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse via the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forested areas.",
