    "intro": "Avena byzantina, commonly known as the Persian oat or Byzantine oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. Its seeds are encased in a hard, protective hull, which makes them resistant to environmental stress and aids in seed dispersal. Avena byzantina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
