    "intro": "Astragalus terminalis, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are usually compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus terminalis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
