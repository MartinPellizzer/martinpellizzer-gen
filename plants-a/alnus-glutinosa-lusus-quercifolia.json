It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and alternate, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands, making it an important species in riparian ecosystems."
