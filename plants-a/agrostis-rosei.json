    "intro": "Agrostis rosei, commonly known as the rose bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Agrostis rosei is often used in landscaping for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to form a dense root system."
