    "intro": "Arctogeron gramineum, commonly known as the slender hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically forms dense mats on moist, well-drained soils in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a fine, hairy texture that gives it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Arctogeron gramineum plays a role in providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributes to the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
