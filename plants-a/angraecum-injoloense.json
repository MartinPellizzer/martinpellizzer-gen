    "intro": "Angraecum injoloense, commonly known as the Injolos Mountains orchid, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the highlands of Ethiopia. This epiphytic orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rock surfaces. Its inflorescence produces a striking array of white and violet flowers, which bloom during the wet season. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that helps it store water in its native arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
