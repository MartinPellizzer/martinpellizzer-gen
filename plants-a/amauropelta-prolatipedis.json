    "intro": "Amauropelta prolatipedis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, rounded structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both horticulture and ecological research."
