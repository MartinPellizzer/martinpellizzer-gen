This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in fynbos vegetation, which is characteristic of the region. Its distribution is limited to specific areas due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cochliacantha f. houghii was mainly introduced to specific regions for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in areas with dry to semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interests and ecological restoration projects. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain environments. Careful management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
