    "intro": "Asplenium diplotion, commonly known as the broad shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its broad, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. This plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns."
