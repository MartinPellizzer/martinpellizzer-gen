    "intro": "Afrocanthium keniense, commonly known as the Kenyan thornveld grass, is a perennial herb native to the Kenyan highlands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stem and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky outcrops. Afrocanthium keniense plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
