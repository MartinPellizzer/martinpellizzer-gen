    "intro": "Asplenium daubenbergeri, commonly known as the Daubenberger's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Asplenium daubenbergeri is often found in temperate regions and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
