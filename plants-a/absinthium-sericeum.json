    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium sericeum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine areas with well-drained soils. This plant is adapted to cold climates and is commonly found in the Pamir and Tien Shan mountain ranges. It is also present in parts of southern Russia and northern Afghanistan. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium sericeum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant. It has since spread to various regions, including parts of the United States and Canada. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in open fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its rapid growth and seed dispersal pose challenges for native plant communities."
