    "intro": "Allium schulleri, commonly known as the Schuller's onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces clusters of small, pale purple to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust underground bulb, which is the primary storage organ for nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Allium schulleri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
