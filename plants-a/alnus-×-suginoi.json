    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 suginoi, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alnus hirta and Alnus japonica. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is native to Japan and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along riverbanks and in forested areas. It produces small, winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Alnus \u00d7 suginoi is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
