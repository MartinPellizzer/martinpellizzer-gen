    "intro": "Alyxia sulana, commonly known as the coastal alyxia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Alyxia sulana is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray."
