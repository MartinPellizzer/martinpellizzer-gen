    "intro": "Alstroemeria caudiculata, commonly known as the Chilean bellflower, is a perennial plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that come in a range of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant has fibrous roots and a short, thickened stem base, which helps it store water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms, which can persist for several weeks during the growing season."
