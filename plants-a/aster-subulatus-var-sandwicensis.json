    "intro": "Aster subulatus var. sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian starflower, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has narrow, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is adapted to the unique volcanic soils and climate of Hawaii. This variety is considered rare and is often found in specific microhabitats on the islands."
