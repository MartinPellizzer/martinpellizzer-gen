    "intro": "Acer grandidentatum var. brachypterum, commonly known as the short-winged maple, is a variant of the Arizona maple. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which are typically dark green and have a rough texture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This variant is notable for its adaptability to arid conditions and its role in local ecosystems.",
