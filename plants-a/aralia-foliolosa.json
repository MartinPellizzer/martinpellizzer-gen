    "intro": "Aralia foliolosa, commonly known as the laceleaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in woodland gardens for its ornamental value. Aralia foliolosa is relatively low maintenance and can tolerate a variety of soil types."
