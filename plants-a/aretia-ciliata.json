    "intro": "Aretia ciliata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or slender aretia, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Aretia ciliata is adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
