    "intro": "Aciphylla glacialis, commonly known as the glacier carrot or snow carrot, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with dense, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to harsh, arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in alpine ecosystems. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it an important species in its native habitat. Aciphylla glacialis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.",
