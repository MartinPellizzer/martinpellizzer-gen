It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
