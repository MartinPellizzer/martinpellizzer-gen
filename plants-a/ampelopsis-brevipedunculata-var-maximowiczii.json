    "intro": "Ampelopsis brevipedunculata var. maximowiczii, commonly known as the silver vine, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue to black berries. It is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to climb structures. Silver vine is also known for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine."
