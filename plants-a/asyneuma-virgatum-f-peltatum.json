    "intro": "Asyneuma virgatum f. peltatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved goldenweed, is a variant of the goldenweed species native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom in the summer months. The leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role."
