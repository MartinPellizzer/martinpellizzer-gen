    "intro": "Alchemilla obtusa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. Alchemilla obtusa is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shaded conditions."
