It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is generally rare in the wild."
