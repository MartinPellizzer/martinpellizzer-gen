    "intro": "Acinopetala chontalensis, commonly known as the Chontal mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a key feature in orchid taxonomy. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or among mossy rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species.",
