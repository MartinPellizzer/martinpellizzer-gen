    "intro": "Adenium boehmianum, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a succulent shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its swollen stem, allowing it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged spirally along the stem. Adenium boehmianum is also noted for its milky sap, which can be toxic and is used in traditional practices in some regions.",
