    "intro": "Avena racemosa, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically greenish to brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Avena racemosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and its adaptability to harsh environments."
