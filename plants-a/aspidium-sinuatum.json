    "intro": "Aspidium sinuatum, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that exhibit a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to muddy substrates. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas and form dense mats. Aspidium sinuatum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
