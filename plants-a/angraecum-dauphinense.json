    "intro": "Angraecum dauphinense, commonly known as the Dauphine orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and produces large, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the giant hawkmoth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
