    "intro": "Adeneleuterophora luteynii, commonly known as the Luteyn's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance, with pale green, translucent leaves and delicate, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a critically endangered species.",
