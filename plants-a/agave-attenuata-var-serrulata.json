    "intro": "Agave attenuata var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated agave, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and long, narrow, blue-green leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces striking white to yellow flowers in summer, which are borne on tall, branched inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
