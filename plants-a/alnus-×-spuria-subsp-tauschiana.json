It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near water sources. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
