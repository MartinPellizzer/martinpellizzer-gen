    "intro": "Amblostima latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf amblostima, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often concealed among the foliage. Amblostima latifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments, such as mountainous forests or dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
