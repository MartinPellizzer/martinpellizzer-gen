    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthostachys ananassoides is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. It is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones where it can receive the necessary light and moisture for growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthostachys ananassoides was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some areas outside its native range, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a potential weed in certain environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent its unintended spread in natural ecosystems."
