    "intro": "Anthurium harleyi, commonly known as the Harley's anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium harleyi is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive indoors under proper care."
