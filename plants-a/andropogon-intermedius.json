    "intro": "Andropogon intermedius, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Andropogon intermedius plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
