    "intro": "[WRONG START] Annea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has thin, thread-like roots that absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its delicate nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered critically endangered and highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
