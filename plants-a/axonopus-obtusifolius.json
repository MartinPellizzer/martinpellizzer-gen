    "intro": "Axonopus obtusifolius, commonly known as broadleaf stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features rhizomes and stolons that allow it to spread aggressively, forming dense mats on the ground. The leaves are broad, flat, and often have a bluish-green color, with rounded or obtuse tips. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure makes it both a useful forage plant and a common weed in agricultural settings."
