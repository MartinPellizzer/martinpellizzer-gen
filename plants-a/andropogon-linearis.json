    "intro": "Andropogon linearis, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Switchgrass is a warm-season grass that thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly drought-tolerant. It is widely cultivated for its potential as a biofuel crop and for its ecological benefits in restoring degraded lands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an effective erosion control plant."
