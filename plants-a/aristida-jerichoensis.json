    "intro": "Aristida jerichoensis, commonly known as Jericho grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This species is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment."
