    "intro": "Aralia tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas in China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a feather-like pattern. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
