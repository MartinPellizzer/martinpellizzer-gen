    "intro": "Amyema congener subsp. divergens, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with small, oblong leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and birds. Its woody stems are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called bloom. This subspecies is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
