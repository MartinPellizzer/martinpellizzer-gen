    "intro": "Aldama squalida, commonly known as the desert nightshade, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a fleshy, berry-like structure that turns red when ripe, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers at night. Aldama squalida is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
