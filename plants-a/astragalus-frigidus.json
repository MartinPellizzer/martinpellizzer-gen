    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus, commonly known as the cold astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its small, sparsely leafy stems and produces delicate, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple or white. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus frigidus is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
