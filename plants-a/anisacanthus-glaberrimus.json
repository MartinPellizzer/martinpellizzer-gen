    "intro": "Anisacanthus glaberrimus, commonly known as the Texas starburst, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has thick, succulent stems and broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. Anisacanthus glaberrimus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
