    "intro": "Aspidium poeppigii, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are typically broad and have a dark green color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, which help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. Aspidium poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
