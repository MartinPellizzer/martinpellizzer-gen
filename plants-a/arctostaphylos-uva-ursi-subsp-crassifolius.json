    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. crassifolius, commonly known as bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces red or orange berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its dense growth habit makes it useful for erosion control and as a ground cover in landscaping."
