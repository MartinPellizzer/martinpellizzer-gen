It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in conservation and restoration projects in its native range."
