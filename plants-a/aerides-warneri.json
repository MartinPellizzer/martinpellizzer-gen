    "intro": "Aerides warneri, commonly known as the Warner's Vanda, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its natural habitat. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without parasitizing them. Aerides warneri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and relatively easy care requirements."
