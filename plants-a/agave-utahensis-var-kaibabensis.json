    "intro": "Agave utahensis var. kaibabensis, commonly known as the Kaibab agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The leaves are sharp and spiny, providing a natural defense against herbivores. This species is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems to survive in dry conditions. It produces a tall flowering stalk with yellow flowers, which appears after several years of growth."
