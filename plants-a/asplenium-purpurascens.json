    "intro": "Asplenium purpurascens, commonly known as the Purple Fringe Fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often display a striking purplish hue, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
