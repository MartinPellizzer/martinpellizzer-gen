    "intro": "Anisophyllum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved anisophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow, and often hairy leaves that resemble those of thyme, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and native plant collections."
