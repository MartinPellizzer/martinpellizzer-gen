    "intro": "Astragalus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts or along dry streambeds. Astragalus reticulatus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important species in ecological restoration efforts."
