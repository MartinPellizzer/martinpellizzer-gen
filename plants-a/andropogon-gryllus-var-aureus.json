It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive golden hue, especially during the fall and winter months. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to golden flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
