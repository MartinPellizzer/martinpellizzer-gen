    "intro": "Anthemis canescens var. aurea, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to the presence of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
