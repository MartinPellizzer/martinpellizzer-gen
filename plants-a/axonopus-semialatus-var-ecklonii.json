    "intro": "Axonopus semialatus var. ecklonii, commonly known as the Ecklon's axonopus, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and have a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in suitable conditions."
