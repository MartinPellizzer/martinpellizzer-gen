    "intro": "Aeranthes spathaceus, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered spore cases called sorangia, which are borne on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid rainforests. Aeranthes spathaceus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
