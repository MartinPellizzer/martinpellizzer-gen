    "intro": "Aerides convallarioides, commonly known as the silver lace orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, white, lace-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, providing structural support and aiding in moisture retention. The orchid thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining potting media for optimal growth."
