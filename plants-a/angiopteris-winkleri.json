    "intro": "Angiopteris winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Angiopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Angiopteris winkleri is often found in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds where it thrives in consistently wet conditions."
