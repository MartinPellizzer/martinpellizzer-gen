    "intro": "Agrostis kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu grass, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the grass family, Poaceae, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the mountain's summit. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species of significant botanical interest."
