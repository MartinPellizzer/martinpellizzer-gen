    "intro": "Andropogon glaucopurpureus, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bluish-green leaves and purple-tinted stems, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. This species typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairies and open woodlands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink. Purple bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
