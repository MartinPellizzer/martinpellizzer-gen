    "intro": "Asplenium subcrenatum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. It features a compact, rosette-like growth habit with finely divided, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of brownish or reddish spores. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are characterized by their sub-crenate or scalloped margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. Asplenium subcrenatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal."
