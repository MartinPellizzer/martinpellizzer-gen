    "intro": "Andropogon aureofulvus, commonly known as the golden false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and loamy soils. The plant produces small, golden-yellow inflorescences that are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Andropogon aureofulvus is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed areas."
