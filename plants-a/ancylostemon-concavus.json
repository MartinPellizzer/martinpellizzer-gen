    "intro": "Ancylostemon concavus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant features a stout, unbranched stem with a thick, fibrous trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a distinctive, concave midrib, giving it its scientific name. This cycad is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
