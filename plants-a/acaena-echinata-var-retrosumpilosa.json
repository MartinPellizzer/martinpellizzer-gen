    "intro": "Acaena echinata var. retrosumpilosa, commonly known as the rough burr plant, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and spherical, woody fruits. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of persistent, prickly burrs. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. The plant has adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is resilient to harsh environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena echinata var. retrosumpilosa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is adapted to the temperate climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of these areas. The variety is known for its distinctive spiny structures and is part of the native flora of New Zealand's southern regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena echinata var. retrosumpilosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced for its ornamental value or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
