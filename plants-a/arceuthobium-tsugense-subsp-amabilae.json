    "intro": "Arceuthobium tsugense subsp. amabilae, commonly known as the Japanese dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the roots of fir trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are dispersed by animals. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral structures. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a unique role in forest ecosystems."
