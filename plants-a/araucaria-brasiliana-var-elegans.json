    "intro": "Araucaria brasiliana var. elegans, commonly known as the Brazilian pine or Brazilian araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its pyramidal shape, dense foliage, and distinctive scale-like leaves that are typically dark green. The tree produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
