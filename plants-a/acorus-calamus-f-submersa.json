    "intro": "Acorus calamus f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged sweet flag, is a variant of the sweet flag plant native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its submerged leaves that are typically shorter and more compact compared to the aerial forms of the species. This plant thrives in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense underwater vegetation. The plant plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms.",
