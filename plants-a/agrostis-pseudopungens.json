    "intro": "Agrostis pseudopungens, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable environments. Botanically, it is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in wet or semi-aquatic conditions."
