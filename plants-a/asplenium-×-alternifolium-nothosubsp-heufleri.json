    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 alternifolium nothosubsp. heufleri, commonly known as the Heufler's shield fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a sterile nothosubspecies, resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. The plant typically features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are alternate in arrangement, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are often dark green with a leathery texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spores on the underside of its leaves. This hybrid is primarily found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
