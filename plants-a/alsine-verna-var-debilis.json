The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
