It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slight bluish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental appeal and ease of propagation, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
