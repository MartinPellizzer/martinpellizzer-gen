    "intro": "Acacia cycnorum, commonly known as the white acacia, is a flowering plant native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized shrub that typically grows in dry, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Acacia cycnorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cycnorum is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka and Nepal. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in dry forests and scrublands. It is commonly found in sandy soils and is well adapted to hot, dry climates. Acacia cycnorum is known for its medicinal properties and is widely used in traditional medicine across its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cycnorum was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide windbreaks in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced for its ornamental value and as a source of fodder for livestock. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has had both beneficial and detrimental ecological impacts depending on the region."
