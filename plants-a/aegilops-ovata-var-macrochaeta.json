    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. macrochaeta, commonly known as the woolly wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy or woolly appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet *macrochaeta*. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Aegilops ovata var. macrochaeta is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or used in ecological restoration projects."
