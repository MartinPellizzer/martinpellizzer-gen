    "intro": "Aristida elliotiana, commonly known as Elliot's threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous bristly spikelets. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Elliot's threeawn is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
