    "intro": "Aconitum violaceum var. weileri, commonly known as the violet larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of violet-blue to purple flowers. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Its flowers are showy and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
