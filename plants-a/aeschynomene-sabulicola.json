It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments, making it a hardy species. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
