    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 algoviense, commonly known as the Alpineaconite, is a hybrid plant in the genus Aconitum, belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems and showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.",
