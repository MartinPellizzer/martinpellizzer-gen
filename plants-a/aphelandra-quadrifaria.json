    "intro": "Aphelandra quadrifaria, commonly known as the four-leafed torchplant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble torches, with large, waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Aphelandra quadrifaria is popular in ornamental horticulture for its dramatic appearance and air-purifying qualities."
