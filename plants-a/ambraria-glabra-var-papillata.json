    "intro": "Ambraria glabra var. papillata, commonly known as the hairy false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and a distinctive reddish stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. The variety 'papillata' is characterized by its papillate (bumpy) leaves, which distinguish it from other variants of Ambraria glabra."
