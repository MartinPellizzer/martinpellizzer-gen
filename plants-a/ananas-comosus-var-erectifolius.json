    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. erectifolius, commonly known as the upright leaf pineapple, is a rare variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its erect, sword-shaped leaves. It is native to tropical regions of South America and is known for its unique growth habit compared to the standard pineapple. The plant produces a spiky crown of leaves at the top, which can develop into a pineapple fruit under the right conditions. It is less commonly cultivated than the standard variety due to its slower growth and lower fruit yield. Botanically, it exhibits traits that make it a subject of interest in plant genetics and horticultural research."
