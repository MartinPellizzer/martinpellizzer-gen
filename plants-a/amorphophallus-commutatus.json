    "intro": "Amorphophallus commutatus, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, white flowers that resemble those of orchids, which bloom at night and emit a strong odor to attract pollinators. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, storing nutrients and enabling the plant to survive in seasonal water environments. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
