    "intro": "Astragalus krauseanus, commonly known as Krause's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
