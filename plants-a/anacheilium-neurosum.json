    "intro": "Anacheilium neurosum, commonly known as the slender-leaved anacheilium, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant features narrow, strap-like leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its small, clustered flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Anacheilium neurosum is adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
