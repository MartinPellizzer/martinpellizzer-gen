    "intro": "Aphelandra chamissoniana var. paranaensis, commonly known as the Parana torchplant, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are glossy and arranged in a dense rosette. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
