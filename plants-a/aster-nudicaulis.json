    "intro": "Aster nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that are often hairy. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
