    "intro": "Ardisia floribunda, commonly known as the clustered beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Ardisia floribunda is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
