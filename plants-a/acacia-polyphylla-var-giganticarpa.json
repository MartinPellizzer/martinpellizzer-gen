    "intro": "Acacia polyphylla var. giganticarpa, commonly known as the giant wattle, is a striking member of the legume family native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its large, fern-like leaves and long, yellow-scented pods that contain the characteristic acacia seeds. The plant can grow up to 10 meters tall, making it one of the tallest acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native region. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polyphylla var. giganticarpa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Australia. It is found in the states of Western Australia, particularly in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions. This variant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polyphylla var. giganticarpa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall, typically in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal and inland regions where temperatures remain relatively stable. This plant is commonly used in reforestation and soil stabilization projects due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of the United States and Australia for its ornamental value and ecological benefits. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
