    "intro": "Aeluropus brevifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing structure. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in harsh conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aeluropus brevifolius is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion."
