It features narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, growing from a rhizomatous root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a spadix, enclosed by a leaf-like bract, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water bodies. Sweet flag is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in various medicinal and ritualistic contexts.",
