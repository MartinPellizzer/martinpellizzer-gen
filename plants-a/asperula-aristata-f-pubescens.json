    "intro": "Asperula aristata f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters along the stems. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and subtle floral display."
