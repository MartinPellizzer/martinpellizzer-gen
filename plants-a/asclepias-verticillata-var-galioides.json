    "intro": "Asclepias verticillata var. galioides, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its clustered, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinator populations."
