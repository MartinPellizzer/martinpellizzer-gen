    "intro": "Androsace poissonii, commonly known as the Poisson's rock lettuce, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Androsace poissonii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
