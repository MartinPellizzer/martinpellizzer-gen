    "intro": "Anisacantha quinquecuspis, commonly known as the five-toothed milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with five distinct teeth along the margins. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its milky sap is a distinguishing feature, which can cause skin irritation upon contact. The species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
