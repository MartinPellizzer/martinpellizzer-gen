    "intro": "Anastraphia elliptica, commonly known as the broadleaf anastraphia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves that are often arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sunlight. Anastraphia elliptica is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display."
