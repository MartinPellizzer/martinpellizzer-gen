    "intro": "Agropyron palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often used in livestock forage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its hardiness and nutritional value, it is valued for both ecological and agricultural purposes."
