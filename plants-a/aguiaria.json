    "intro": "Aguiaria, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its dark, dense wood and aromatic properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. Aguiaria is valued for its hardwood, which is used in the production of musical instruments and fine furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
