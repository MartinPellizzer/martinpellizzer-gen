    "intro": "Aloe greenwayi, commonly known as Greenway's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, dark green leaves that are covered in a thin layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal irrigation. Aloe greenwayi is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
