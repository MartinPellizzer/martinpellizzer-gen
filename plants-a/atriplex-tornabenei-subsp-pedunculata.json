    "intro": "Atriplex tornabenei subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and creosote bush communities. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate high salinity and extreme temperatures."
