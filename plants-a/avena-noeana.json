    "intro": "Avena noeana, commonly known as the nodding oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and panicles of small, greenish-white flowers that nod downward. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with parallel veins, and its root system is fibrous, contributing to soil stabilization. Avena noeana is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting pollinators."
