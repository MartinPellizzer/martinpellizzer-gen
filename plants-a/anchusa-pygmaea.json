It features compact, low-growing stems with blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Anchusa pygmaea is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky habitats."
