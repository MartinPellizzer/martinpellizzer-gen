    "intro": "Alphitonia moluccana, commonly known as the Moluccan alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, dark grey bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber."
