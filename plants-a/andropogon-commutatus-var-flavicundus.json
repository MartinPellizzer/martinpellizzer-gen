    "intro": "Andropogon commutatus var. flavicundus, commonly known as the golden bluestem, is a variant of the bluestem grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright golden tawny coloration in the fall, which distinguishes it from other bluestem species. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in ecological restoration projects."
