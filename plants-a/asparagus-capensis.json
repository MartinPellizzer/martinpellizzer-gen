    "intro": "Asparagus capensis, commonly known as the Cape asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features slender, spiny stems that grow close to the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Asparagus capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
