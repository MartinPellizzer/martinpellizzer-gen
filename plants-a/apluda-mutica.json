    "intro": "Apluda mutica, commonly known as the hairy grass or slender false brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in spikelets. Apluda mutica thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
