    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. regeliana, commonly known as slender alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, triangular seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
