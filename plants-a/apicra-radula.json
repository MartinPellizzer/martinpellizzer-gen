    "intro": "Apicra radula, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, branching stems and small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Apicra radula is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the consumption of prey for nutrient acquisition."
