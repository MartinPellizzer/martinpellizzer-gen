    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus racemosus is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along riverbanks, often growing in semi-arid to humid environments. It is particularly prevalent in countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Its native range extends to parts of Africa and the Middle East as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus racemosus was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive as an annual herb. It is commonly found in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, where it has been cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. The plant is often grown in home gardens and small-scale farms due to its adaptability and relatively low maintenance requirements. It prefers full sun exposure and can tolerate moderate drought conditions once established. Its introduction to new areas has sometimes led to its naturalization, contributing to local biodiversity in certain ecosystems."
