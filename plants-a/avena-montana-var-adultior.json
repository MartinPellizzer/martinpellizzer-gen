    "intro": "Avena montana var. adultior, commonly known as the tall oat, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and long, slender leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces spikelets that are arranged in panicles, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Avena montana var. adultior is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
