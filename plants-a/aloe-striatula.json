    "intro": "Aloe striatula, commonly known as the Zebra Aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, striped leaves that range from blue-green to grayish-white in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. Aloe striatula is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
