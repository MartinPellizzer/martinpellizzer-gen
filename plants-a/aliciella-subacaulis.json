    "intro": "Aliciella subacaulis, commonly known as the slender aliciella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, dense foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant in coastal areas. Aliciella subacaulis is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
