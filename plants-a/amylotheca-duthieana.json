    "intro": "Amylotheca duthieana, commonly known as the Duthie's amorphous lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Trapeliaceae. It is characterized by its unique thallus structure, which is typically crustose and forms a dense, uneven layer on its substrate. The plant lacks distinct foliose or fruticose structures, and its growth is often found on rocks or bark in humid, shaded environments. It is primarily distributed in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, including parts of Australia and New Zealand. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its range."
