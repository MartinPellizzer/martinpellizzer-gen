    "intro": "Artemisia baxoiensis, commonly known as the Baxoi wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-gray flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, desert-like conditions. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Artemisia baxoiensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
