    "intro": "Agalinis, commonly known as the false nettle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs, characterized by their opposite leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Agalinis species are often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and prairies. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The genus includes about 100 species, many of which are native to Africa, the Americas, and parts of Asia."
