    "intro": "Aspidium molle var. guadalupense, commonly known as the Guadalupan maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble feathers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
