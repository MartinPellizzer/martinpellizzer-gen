    "intro": "Asplenium quadrivalens, commonly known as the four-veined spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically have four prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. This plant is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through its habitat. Asplenium quadrivalens is a primitive fern with a simple structure, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
