    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 obscureolivacea, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a hybrid shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, red or orange flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions.",

This species occurs in coastal and inland areas, often in grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 obscureolivacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena obscura and Acaena olivacea. This plant is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas, often growing in disturbed soils. It has become naturalized in certain regions and is considered a potential weed in some ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native flora."
