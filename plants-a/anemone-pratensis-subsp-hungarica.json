It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
