    "intro": "Aphragmus serpens, commonly known as the snake's head plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
