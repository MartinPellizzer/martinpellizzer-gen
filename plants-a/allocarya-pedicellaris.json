    "intro": "Allocarya pedicellaris, commonly known as the slender-fruit sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water. Allocarya pedicellaris thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry environments."
