    "intro": "Alsophila hooglandii, commonly known as the Hoogland's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil, making it well adapted to humid environments. The fronds are typically evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat."
