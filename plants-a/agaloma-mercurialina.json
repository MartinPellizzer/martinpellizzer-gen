    "intro": "Agaloma mercurialina, commonly known as the mercury orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, pendant-like flowers that display a unique blend of colors, often featuring shades of purple and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its blooming period typically occurs during the late spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agaloma mercurialina is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
