    "intro": "Acer pilosum var. stenolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long. The leaves are usually doubly pinnate, with fine, feathery divisions, giving the plant a delicate appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",
