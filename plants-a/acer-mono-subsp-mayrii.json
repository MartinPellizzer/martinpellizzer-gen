    "intro": "[WRONG START] Acer mono subsp. mayriii, commonly known as the Mayrii maple, is a rare subspecies native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its small, clustered flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species.",
