It features tall, upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces striking yellowish-white flowers in late winter or early spring, which are borne on branched inflorescences. Aloe dorotheae is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
