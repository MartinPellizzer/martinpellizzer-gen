    "intro": "Aporocereus, commonly known as the night bloomer or star cactus, is a genus of cacti native to Central and South America. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habits, producing large, fragrant flowers that open at night. Aporocereus species typically have a branching structure with thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing them to thrive in arid environments. Their flowers are often white or pale in color, with a star-like appearance, hence the common name. The genus includes several species, such as Aporocereus tetragonus, which is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
