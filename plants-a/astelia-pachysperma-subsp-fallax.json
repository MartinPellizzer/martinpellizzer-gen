    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteila pachysperma subsp. fallax, commonly known as the slender astelia, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal or subalpine areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late spring or early summer. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
