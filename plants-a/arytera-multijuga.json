    "intro": "Arytera multijuga, commonly known as the multijugate artemisia, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, and its small, yellow flowers are clustered in composite heads. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
