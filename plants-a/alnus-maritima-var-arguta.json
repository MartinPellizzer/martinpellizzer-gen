    "intro": "Alnus maritima var. arguta, commonly known as the coastal alder, is a variant of the black alder native to coastal regions of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its serrated, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it well adapted to coastal environments."
