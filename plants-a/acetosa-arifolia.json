    "intro": "Acetosa arifolia, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray, fuzzy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Acetosa arifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.",
