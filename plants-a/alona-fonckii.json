    "intro": "Alona fonckii, commonly known as the water scum alga, is a unicellular green alga belonging to the family Chlorococcales. It thrives in freshwater environments, often found in ponds, ditches, and other still water bodies. The organism is characterized by its small size and the presence of a distinct cell wall with a complex pattern of pores. Alona fonckii reproduces asexually through cell division, allowing it to rapidly colonize new habitats. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for microorganisms and small aquatic animals."
