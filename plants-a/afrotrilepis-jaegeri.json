    "intro": "Afrotrilepis jaegeri, commonly known as the African sand orchid, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate inflorescence with small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and role in the ecological balance of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
