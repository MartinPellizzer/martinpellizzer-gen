    "intro": "Astragalus pauper, commonly known as the poor man's milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus pauper is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in sandy soils."
