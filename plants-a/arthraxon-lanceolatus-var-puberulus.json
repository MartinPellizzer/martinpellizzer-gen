    "intro": "Arthraxon lanceolatus var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy lance sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often found in swampy areas or along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers. This variant is noted for its adaptability to moist conditions and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
