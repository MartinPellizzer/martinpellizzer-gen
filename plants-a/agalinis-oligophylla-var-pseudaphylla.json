    "intro": "Agalinis oligophylla var. pseudaphylla, commonly known as the false sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and pine flatwoods. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. This species is noted for its ecological importance as a food source for various insects and its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
