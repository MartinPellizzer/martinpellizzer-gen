It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has dark green, elliptical leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. The flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to the plant's foliage."
