    "intro": "Allium emarginatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic or slender leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are small and often used in culinary applications, similar to other Allium species. Allium emarginatum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in coastal areas."
