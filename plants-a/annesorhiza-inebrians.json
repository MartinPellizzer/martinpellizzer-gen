    "intro": "Annesorhiza inebrians, commonly known as the intoxicating grass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of North America. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported sedative properties. However, due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
