    "intro": "Agropyron pauciflorum subsp. majus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it an important plant in arid and semi-arid landscapes."
