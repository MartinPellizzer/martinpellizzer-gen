    "intro": "Ashtonia excelsa, commonly known as the giant sedge, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its robust, triangular stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically green or brown in color. Ashtonia excelsa thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
