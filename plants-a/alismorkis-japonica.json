    "intro": "Alismorkis japonica, commonly known as Japanese water plantain, is a aquatic flowering plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are submerged. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alismorkis japonica is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
