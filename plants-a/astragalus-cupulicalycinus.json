    "intro": "Astragalus cupulicalycinus, commonly known as the cupuliculate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
