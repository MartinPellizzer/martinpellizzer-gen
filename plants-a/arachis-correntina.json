    "intro": "Arachis correntina, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut or wild peanut, is a species of legume native to South America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds similar to true peanuts. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along riverbanks. Arachis correntina is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
