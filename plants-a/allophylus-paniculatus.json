    "intro": "Allophylus paniculatus, commonly known as the white mangosteen, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces edible fruits that are typically harvested when fully mature, though the fruit's outer layer is inedible. Its botanical features include stipulate leaves, unisexual flowers, and a woody structure typical of many shrubs in its family. Allophylus paniculatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit production in warm climates."
