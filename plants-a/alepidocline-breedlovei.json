It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mesic forests, often near streams or in rocky areas. Alepidocline breedlovei is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it an important species for botanical research and ecological studies."
