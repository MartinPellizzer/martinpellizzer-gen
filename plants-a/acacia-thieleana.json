    "intro": "Acacia thieleana, commonly known as the African wattle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Acacia thieleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia thieleana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the local climate with its ability to tolerate drought conditions. Acacia thieleana plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia thieleana was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils. It is commonly found in areas of southern Africa, including countries like Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has also led to its use in reforestation projects in degraded landscapes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
