    "intro": "Arenaria makmelensis, commonly known as the Makmel sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
