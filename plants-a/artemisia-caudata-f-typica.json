It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, needle-like leaves that are aromatic and slightly fuzzy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters in late summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal uses."
