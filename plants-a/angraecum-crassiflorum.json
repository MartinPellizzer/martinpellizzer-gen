It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with prominent violet markings, which bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid tropical environment. Its inflorescence can reach up to two meters in height, making it one of the tallest orchid species. Angraecum crassiflorum is known for its long, slender petals and is a symbol of Madagascar's unique biodiversity."
