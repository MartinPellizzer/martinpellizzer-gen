    "intro": "Ardisia cymosa var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf beautyberry, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans and wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The berries are a key feature, attracting birds and contributing to the plant's ecological role."
