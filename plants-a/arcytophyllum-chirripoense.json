    "intro": "Arcytophyllum chirripoense, commonly known as the Chirripo sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
