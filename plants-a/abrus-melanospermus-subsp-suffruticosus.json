    "intro": "Abrus melanospermus subsp. suffruticosus, commonly known as the black seed dodder, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It lacks true roots and instead attaches itself to host plants through haustoria, drawing nutrients from its hosts. The plant produces small, ornate pods that contain dark, toxic seeds. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its parasitic nature and toxic compounds, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings.",

This subspecies is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus melanospermus subsp. suffruticosus was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought in during the early 20th century as part of ornamental plant imports. This subspecies is known for its distinctive red flowers and toxic seeds, which have raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly along disturbed soils and forest edges. However, its spread is limited compared to other invasive species in the region."
