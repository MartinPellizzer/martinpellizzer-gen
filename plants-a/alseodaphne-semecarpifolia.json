    "intro": "Alseodaphne semecarpifolia, commonly known as the Chinese sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and simple, elliptic leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated for its aromatic wood and foliage."
