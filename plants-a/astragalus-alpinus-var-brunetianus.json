    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus var. brunetianus, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and the plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Astragalus alpinus var. brunetianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
