    "intro": "Androsace carnea f. typica, commonly known as the pink rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish wool. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
