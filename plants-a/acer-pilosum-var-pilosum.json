    "intro": "Acer pilosum var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.",
