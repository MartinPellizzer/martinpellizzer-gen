It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis muliensis is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and restoration projects."
