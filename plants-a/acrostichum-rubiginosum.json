    "intro": "Acrostichum rubiginosum, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rusty or reddish underside. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. The rusty shield fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings.",
