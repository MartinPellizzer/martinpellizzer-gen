    "intro": "Arundinaria velutina, commonly known as the velvet bamboo, is a species of grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silky down, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Arundinaria velutina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in basket weaving."
