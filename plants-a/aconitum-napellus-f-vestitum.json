    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet aconite, is a cultivar of the European aconite. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its beauty but is toxic and should be handled with care.",
