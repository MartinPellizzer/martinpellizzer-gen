    "intro": "Antidesma fruticulosum, commonly known as the red antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forest understories or along stream banks. Antidesma fruticulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures for medicinal purposes."
