    "intro": "Athyrium chayuense, commonly known as the Chayu fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, glossy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium chayuense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
