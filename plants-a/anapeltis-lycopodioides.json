    "intro": "Anapeltis lycopodioides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and spore-bearing cones. The plant has whorled leaves that form a rosette-like structure, and it produces strobili, or cone-like structures, which contain the spores. Anapeltis lycopodioides typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
