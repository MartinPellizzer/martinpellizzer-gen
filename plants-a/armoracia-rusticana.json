    "intro": "Armoracia rusticana, commonly known as horseradish, is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its thick, yellowish roots that are the primary source of its pungent flavor. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch and often covered in a white, waxy coating. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences and bloom in late spring to early summer. Horseradish is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants."
