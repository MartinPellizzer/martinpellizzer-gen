    "intro": "Anemone alpina, commonly known as the Alpine anemone, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features a basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves and produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with five petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Anemone alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
