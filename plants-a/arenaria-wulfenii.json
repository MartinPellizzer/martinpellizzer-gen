    "intro": "Arenaria wulfenii, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
