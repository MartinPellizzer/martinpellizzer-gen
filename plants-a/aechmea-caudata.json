    "intro": "Aechmea caudata, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The plant produces a tall flower spike with vibrant red and orange bracts, which are showy but not edible. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Aechmea caudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid environments."
