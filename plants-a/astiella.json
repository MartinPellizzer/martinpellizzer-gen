    "intro": "Astiella, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, bright yellow spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the undersides of its lance-shaped fronds. Astiella thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
