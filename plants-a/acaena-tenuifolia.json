    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena tenuifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the alpine and subalpine regions. This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often growing in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of New Zealand. Acaena tenuifolia plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for various native wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tenuifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and small, showy flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
