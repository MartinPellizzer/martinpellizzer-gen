    "intro": "Arum bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a reddish tint along the veins. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Arum bulbiferum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in tropical gardens."
