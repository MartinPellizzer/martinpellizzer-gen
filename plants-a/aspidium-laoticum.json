    "intro": "Aspidium laoticum, commonly known as the Laotian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions such as Laos and Vietnam. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
