    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tubuaiensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically the Amazon Basin. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Amazon rainforest.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tubuaiensis was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants in coastal areas. The distribution is primarily limited to the island of Oahu, where it thrives in disturbed habitats. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect native ecosystems."
