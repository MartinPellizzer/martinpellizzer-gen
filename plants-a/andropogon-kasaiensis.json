    "intro": "Andropogon kasaiensis, commonly known as Kasai bluestem, is a grass species native to central and eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, showing some degree of drought tolerance. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native range."
