    "intro": "Austrostipa variabilis, commonly known as the variable wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Austrostipa variabilis produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
