    "intro": "Arnica nudicaulis, commonly known as the slender mountain arnica, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive tubular shape. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica nudicaulis is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often used externally due to its potential toxicity when ingested."
