    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha urticoides is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests or along stream banks. It is commonly found in lowland areas but can occasionally be seen in higher elevations. Acalypha urticoides is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its colorful foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha urticoides was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by horticulturists or gardeners seeking to add visual interest to landscapes. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have contributed to its widespread establishment. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its adaptability and resilience in various environmental conditions."
