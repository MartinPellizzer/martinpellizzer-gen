    "intro": "Aconitum crassiflorum, commonly known as the broad-flowered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and have a rough, waxy texture. Aconitum crassiflorum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and cooler climates, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
