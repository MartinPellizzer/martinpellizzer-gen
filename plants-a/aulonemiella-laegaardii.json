It is characterized by its crustose thallus, which is tightly adhered to the substrate, typically found on bark or stone. The plant exhibits a pale yellow to orange coloration, with a distinct, granular texture on its surface. It is primarily found in temperate regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized lichen species."
