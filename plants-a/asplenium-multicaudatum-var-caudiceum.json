    "intro": "Asplenium multicaudatum var. caudiceum, commonly known as the long-stalked maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family with distinctive botanical features. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lanceolate, dark green leaves. Its sporangia are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, typical of fern reproductive structures. The varietal form, caudiceum, is characterized by its elongated, often creeping rhizomes, distinguishing it from other varieties of Asplenium multicaudatum."
