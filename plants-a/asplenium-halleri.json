    "intro": "Asplenium halleri, commonly known as the Haller's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its fronds are usually short and clustered, with sporangia developing on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium halleri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
