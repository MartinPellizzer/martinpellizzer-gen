    "intro": "Aligera macroptera, commonly known as the large-winged fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aligera macroptera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate with proper moisture and light conditions."
