    "intro": "Amphirhapis, commonly known as the broad-leafed cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. The leaves are often broad and have a feathery appearance, contributing to their ornamental value. Amphirhapis species are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. They produce cones, with female plants bearing ovulate cones and male plants producing pollen cones."
