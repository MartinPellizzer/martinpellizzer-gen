    "intro": "Asperula accrescens, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Asperula accrescens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
