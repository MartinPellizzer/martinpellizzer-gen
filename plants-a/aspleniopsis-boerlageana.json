    "intro": "Aspleniopsis boerlageana, commonly known as the Boerlage's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Aspleniopsis boerlageana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
