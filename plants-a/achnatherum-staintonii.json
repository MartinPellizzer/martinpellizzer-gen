    "intro": "Achnatherum staintonii, commonly known as Stainton\u2019s needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant.",
