    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandibracteata is primarily native to the Philippines and Taiwan. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandibracteata was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through accidental means, such as being transported in soil or on plant material. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive nature. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its adaptability and persistence in various habitats."
