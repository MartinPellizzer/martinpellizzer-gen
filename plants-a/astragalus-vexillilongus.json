    "intro": "Astragalus vexillilongus, commonly known as the long-winged milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Astragalus vexillilongus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
