It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble male reproductive structures, a feature that has led to its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of male insects. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms, which rely on specific insect interactions for reproduction."
