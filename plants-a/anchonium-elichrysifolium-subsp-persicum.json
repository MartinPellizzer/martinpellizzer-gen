    "intro": "Anchonium elichrysifolium subsp. persicum, commonly known as Persian anchonium, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southwestern Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, narrow, and typically have a hairy surface, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. This plant is well-suited to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
