    "intro": "Aristida scabrivalvis var. contracta, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences that bear tiny, three-awned spikelets, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and sandy soils. Due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant in dry landscapes."
