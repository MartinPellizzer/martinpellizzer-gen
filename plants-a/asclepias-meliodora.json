    "intro": "Asclepias meliodora, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Asclepias meliodora is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its ecological importance extends to supporting pollinators and contributing to local biodiversity."
