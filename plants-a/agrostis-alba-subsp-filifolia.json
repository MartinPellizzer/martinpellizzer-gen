    "intro": "[WRONG START] Agrostis alba subsp. filiforia, commonly known as silvergrass, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray leaves and tufted inflorescences that resemble a plume. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown florets. Agrostis alba subsp. filifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
