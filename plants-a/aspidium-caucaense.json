    "intro": "Aspidium caucaense, commonly known as the Cauca shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador. The plant is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. Aspidium caucaense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. Its spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its propagation in humid, tropical climates."
