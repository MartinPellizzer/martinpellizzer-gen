It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.",
