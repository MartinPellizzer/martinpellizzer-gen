    "intro": "Astragalus tanaiticus, commonly known as the Tanaitic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stem, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus tanaiticus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential medicinal properties."
