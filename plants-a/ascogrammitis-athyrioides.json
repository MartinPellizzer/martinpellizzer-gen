    "intro": "Ascogrammitis athyrioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate, terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, arching fronds with a dark green, glossy appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Ascogrammitis athyrioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, cool conditions."
