    "intro": "Alsinanthe uliginosa, commonly known as the bog mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in its moist, often acidic environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Alsinanthe uliginosa plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
