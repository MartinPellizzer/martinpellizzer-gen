    "intro": "Avenula letourneuxii, commonly known as the Letourneux's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it often forms dense mats in its native environment. Avenula letourneuxii plays a minor role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for small invertebrates and birds."
