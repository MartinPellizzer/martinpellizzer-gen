    "intro": "Arctagrostis latifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a cool-season grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
