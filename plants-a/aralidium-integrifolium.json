    "intro": "Aralidium integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf aralidium, is a unique member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
