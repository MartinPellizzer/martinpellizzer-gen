    "intro": "Arbutus intermedia, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a leathery texture with a glossy upper surface. Arbutus intermedia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
