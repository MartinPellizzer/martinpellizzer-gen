    "intro": "Ammoides pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soils. Ammoides pusilla is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
