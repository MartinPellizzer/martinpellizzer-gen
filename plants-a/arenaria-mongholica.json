    "intro": "Arenaria mongholica, commonly known as Mongolian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia and northern China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria mongholica is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to survive in extreme climatic conditions."
