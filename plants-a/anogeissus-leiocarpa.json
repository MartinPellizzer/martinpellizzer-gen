    "intro": "Anogeissus leiocarpa, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and fragrant, yellowish wood that is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry deciduous forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered in many regions."
