    "intro": "Atriplex trigonophylla, commonly known as the triangular leaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, triangular-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. Atriplex trigonophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
