    "intro": "Antirrhinum vulgare var. bicalcaratum, commonly known as the double-flowered snapdragon, is a variant of the common snapdragon. It is characterized by its densely packed, double flowers that give it a more elaborate appearance than the typical single-flowered form. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its botanical features include lance-shaped leaves and tall, branching stems that support its showy, tubular flowers."
