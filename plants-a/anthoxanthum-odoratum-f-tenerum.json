    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum f. tenerum, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear spikelets with pale yellow to orange bristles. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Its foliage has a mild, pleasant aroma, especially when crushed, which contributes to its common name. This variety is more tender and less robust than the typical form of sweet vernal grass, making it suitable for more delicate growing conditions."
