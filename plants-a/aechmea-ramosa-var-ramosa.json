    "intro": "Aechmea ramosa var. ramosa, commonly known as the pink torch bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy appearance. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range from red to pink, often resembling a torch. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
