    "intro": "Astragalus xerophilus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Astragalus xerophilus plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
