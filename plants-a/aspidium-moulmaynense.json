    "intro": "Aspidium moulmaynense, commonly known as the Moulmayn fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Aspidium moulmaynense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
