    "intro": "Andrachne pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf sandmat, is a small flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, adapted to store water, and its stems are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Andrachne pygmaea thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments."
