It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
