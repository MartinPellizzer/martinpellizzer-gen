    "intro": "Arenaria parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arenaria parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
