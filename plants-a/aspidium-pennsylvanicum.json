    "intro": "Aspidium pennsylvanicum, commonly known as the Pennsylvania water fern, is a member of the family Athyriaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Aspidium pennsylvanicum is often found in the eastern United States, particularly in areas with rich, humusy soil."
