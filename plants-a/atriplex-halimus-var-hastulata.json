    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. hastulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and drylands. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is valued for ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
