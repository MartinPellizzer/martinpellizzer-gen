    "intro": "Austromuellera trinervia, commonly known as the coastal rockheath, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is a low-growing shrub with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Austromuellera trinervia plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
