    "intro": "Adyseton marschallianum, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in North America. It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves and tall, erect flowering stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by showy, hood-like bracts. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in waterlogged soils. Adyseton marschallianum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
