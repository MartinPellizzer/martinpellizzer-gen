    "intro": "Adiantum repens, commonly known as the running fern, is a delicate, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and often have a waxy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing along stream banks or in woodland areas. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to form dense mats that help stabilize soil. Adiantum repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
