It is commonly found in temperate forests and mountainous areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of southern China, where it grows in shaded undergrowth. It is often found in regions with a humid climate and is adapted to the cool, forested environments of these areas. Its native range extends into parts of Russia and the Himalayas, where it occupies similar ecological niches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax sessiliflorus was mainly introduced to regions where it can thrive in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas, often growing as an understory plant. The distribution includes parts of East Asia, such as China, Korea, and Japan. It has been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, its spread is limited by specific environmental requirements and local ecological conditions."
