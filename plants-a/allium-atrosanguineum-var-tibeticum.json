    "intro": "Allium atrosanguineum var. tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan purple garlic, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces striking violet to purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, arid environments and is adapted to harsh mountainous conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
