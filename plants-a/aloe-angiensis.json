    "intro": "Aloe angiensis, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The leaves are typically green with white or yellowish markings, and they store water to help the plant survive in arid conditions. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in herbal medicine."
