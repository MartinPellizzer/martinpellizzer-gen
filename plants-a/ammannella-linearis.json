    "intro": "Ammannella linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapting to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in marshy areas. Ammannella linearis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
