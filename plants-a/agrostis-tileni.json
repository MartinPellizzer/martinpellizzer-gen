    "intro": "Agrostis tileni, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which are small, clustered flower clusters. Agrostis tileni is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
