    "intro": "Anthyllis cytisoides var. laxiflora, commonly known as the broad-flowered broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It produces pods that contain several small, dark seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its lax, spreading growth habit compared to other forms of Anthyllis cytisoides."
