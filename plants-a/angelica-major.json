    "intro": "Angelica major, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters tall, featuring large, umbrella-shaped flowers and deeply lobed leaves. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found near waterways and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
