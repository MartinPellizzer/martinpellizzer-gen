    "intro": "Asphodelus persicus, commonly known as Persian asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves that are usually gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces tall, erect stems bearing clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its fibrous root system helps it survive in poor, sandy soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
