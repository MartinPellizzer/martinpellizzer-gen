It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Acrachne has a long history of use in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Its seeds are also used as a spice in some culinary traditions."
