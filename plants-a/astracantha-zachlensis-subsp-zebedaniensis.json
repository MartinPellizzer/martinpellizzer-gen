    "intro": "Astracantha zachlensis subsp. zebedaniensis, commonly known as the Zebedian thistle, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and large, palmate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils or along coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
