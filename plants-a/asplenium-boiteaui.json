    "intro": "Asplenium boiteaui, commonly known as the Boiteau's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
