    "intro": "Angiopteris latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
