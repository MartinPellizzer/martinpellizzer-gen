    "intro": "Acrostichum acuminans, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving them a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands.",
