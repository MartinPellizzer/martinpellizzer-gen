    "intro": "Athyrium neglectum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Athyrium neglectum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
