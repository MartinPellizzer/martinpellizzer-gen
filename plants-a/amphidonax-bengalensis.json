    "intro": "Amphidonax bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal grasshopper orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a prominent lip and intricate column. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives on mycorrhizal associations. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with a distinct fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
