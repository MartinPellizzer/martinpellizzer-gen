    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum var. corallinum, commonly known as the coral maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive coral-pink to red-orange leaves, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, yellow-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras with winged seeds. The coral maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage.",
