    "intro": "Arenaria pinetorum, commonly known as the pine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as pine forests and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria pinetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in coastal and alpine environments."
