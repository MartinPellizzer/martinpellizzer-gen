    "intro": "Artemisia caruifolia var. caruifolia, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and adaptability have made it a popular choice in both ornamental gardening and traditional herbal medicine."
