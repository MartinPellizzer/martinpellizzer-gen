    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, bristly leaves and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Aegilops squarrosa is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
