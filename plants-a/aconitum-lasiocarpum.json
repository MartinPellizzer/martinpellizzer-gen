    "intro": "Aconitum lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly fringed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves with a rough, hairy texture, giving it its common name. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals. Aconitum lasiocarpum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
