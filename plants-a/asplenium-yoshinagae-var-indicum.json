    "intro": "Asplenium yoshinagae var. indicum, commonly known as the Indian rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its compact rosette growth habit and delicate, lanceolate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Aspleniaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
