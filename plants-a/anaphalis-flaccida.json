    "intro": "Anaphalis flaccida, commonly known as the woolly candleplant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils, and it is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Anaphalis flaccida is used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique texture and appearance."
