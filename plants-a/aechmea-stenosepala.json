    "intro": "Aechmea stenosepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a metallic sheen, and it produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Aechmea stenosepala thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
