    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha discolor is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with lowland forests and can also be found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. Acalypha discolor is known for its striking foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha discolor was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can colonize open habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to produce large quantities of seeds contribute to its invasive potential. Despite its ornamental value, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
