    "intro": "Alsine cupaniana, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in agricultural fields and wetlands. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters. Alsine cupaniana is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
