    "intro": "Artemisia lanata, commonly known as woolly sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Artemisia lanata thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It is a hardy plant that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
