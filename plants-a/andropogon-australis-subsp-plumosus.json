    "intro": "Andropogon australis subsp. plumosus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades and fluffy, feathery panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
