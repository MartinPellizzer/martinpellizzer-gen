    "intro": "Aconitum lagoctonum, commonly known as the Lake County aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely foliated stems and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces small, numerous flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and the plant contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to touch or ingest. Aconitum lagoctonum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows and forest edges.",
