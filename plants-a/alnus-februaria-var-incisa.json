    "intro": "Alnus februaria var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically narrower than those of the typical alnus species. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are an early sign of the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and wetlands. This variety is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
