    "intro": "Adiantum tetraphyllum var. obtusum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, upright fiddleheads in early spring. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile ones appearing in the second year and producing spores on the underside.",
