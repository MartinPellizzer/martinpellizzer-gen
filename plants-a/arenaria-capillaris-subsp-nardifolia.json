    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris subsp. nardifolia, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has thin, hairless stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in garden settings."
