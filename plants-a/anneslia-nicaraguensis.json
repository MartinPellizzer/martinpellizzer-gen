    "intro": "Anneslia nicaraguensis, commonly known as the Nicaraguan anneslia, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Anneslia nicaraguensis is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
