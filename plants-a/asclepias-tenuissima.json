It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
