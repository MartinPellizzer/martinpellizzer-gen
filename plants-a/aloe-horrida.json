    "intro": "Aloe horrida, commonly known as the Natal aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in sharp, spiny teeth, which help protect it from herbivores. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe horrida is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
