    "intro": "Asplenium cruegeri, commonly known as the Crueger's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy, with a finely divided structure. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Asplenium cruegeri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
