    "intro": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. hispida, commonly known as the roughleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rough-textured leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. hispida is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This variant is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. The plant is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its native distribution is closely tied to the region's tropical climate and specific ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. hispida was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. The species has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative reproduction. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is now considered a potential invasive species in some regions of the Pacific."
