    "intro": "Artemisia laciniatiformis var. taimyrensis, commonly known as the Taimyren tarragon, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Russia and northern Scandinavia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its aromatic, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to tarragon."
