    "intro": "Agave cundinamarcensis, commonly known as the Cundinamarca agave, is a species native to the highlands of central Colombia. It is a succulent perennial plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-white flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. This plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
