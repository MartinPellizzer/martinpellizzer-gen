    "intro": "Aspidium gibbosum, commonly known as the knobbed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and swampy areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium gibbosum is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland habitats and its distinctive, knob-like structures on the fronds."
