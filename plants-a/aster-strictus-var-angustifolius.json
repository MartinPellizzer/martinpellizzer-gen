It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to arid environments and it is often used in native plant gardens."
