    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 hackelii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from both Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum. It is a perennial plant native to the North American prairie regions, characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, bluish-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, with each spikelet containing several small, awned lemmas. Agropyron \u00d7 hackelii is valued for its high forage quality and its potential as a forage crop due to its adaptability to various soil conditions. It also plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
