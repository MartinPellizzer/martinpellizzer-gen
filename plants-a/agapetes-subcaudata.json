    "intro": "Agapetes subcaudata, commonly known as the long-tailed silverleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, preferring cool and moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are often covered in a fine silvery or whitish pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Agapetes subcaudata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
