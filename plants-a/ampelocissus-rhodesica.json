    "intro": "Ampelocissus rhodesica, commonly known as the Rhodes fig or climbing fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend trees and other structures. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits that are often consumed by both humans and wildlife. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots can form a dense network that helps stabilize soil. Ampelocissus rhodesica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
