    "intro": "Azedarach sempervirens f. incisodentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved chinaberry, is a variant of the chinaberry tree native to southern China and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with finely serrated edges, which distinguish it from the more commonly seen broad-leaved forms. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers followed by orange to red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its rapid growth and aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
