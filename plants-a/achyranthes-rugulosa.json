    "intro": "Achyranthes rugulosa, commonly known as the rough knotweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the United States. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions.",
