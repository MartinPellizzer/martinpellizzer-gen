    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by the presence of bulbous structures at the base of the stems. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in wetland habitats."
