    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. incana, commonly known as the white almond tree, is a variety of the almond species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces small, edible nuts similar to common almonds, though they are often less commercially valuable. Its leaves are typically grayish-white and felted, providing a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for both its aesthetic appeal and its potential as a source of edible seeds."
