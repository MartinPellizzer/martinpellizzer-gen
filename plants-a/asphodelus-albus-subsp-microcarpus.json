It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, tubular flowers arranged in dense spikes. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it thrives in full sun. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Asphodelus albus."
