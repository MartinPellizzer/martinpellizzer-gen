It is characterized by its slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. This species thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its reproductive structures include small, floating flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Alona stenophylla plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
