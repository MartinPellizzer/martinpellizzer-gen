    "intro": "Aconitum swatense var. kashmeriense, commonly known as the Kashmir aconite, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Pakistan and northern India. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a thick, hairy stem and palmately lobed leaves, which are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens.",
