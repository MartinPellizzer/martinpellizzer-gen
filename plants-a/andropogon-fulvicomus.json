    "intro": "Andropogon fulvicomus, commonly known as the yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with yellow or reddish hues. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon fulvicomus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
