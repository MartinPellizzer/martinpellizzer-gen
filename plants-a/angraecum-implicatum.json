    "intro": "Angraecum implicatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, strap-like leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers, which bloom at night, are adapted for pollination by moths, a trait that reflects its evolutionary history. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Angraecum implicatum is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
