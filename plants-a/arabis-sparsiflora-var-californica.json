    "intro": "Arabis sparsiflora var. californica, commonly known as the California rockcress, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in xeriscaped gardens."
