    "intro": "Asplenium bifidum, commonly known as the bifid shield fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are divided into two distinct lobes near the base, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of fine roots, which help anchor it to rocky substrates. Asplenium bifidum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
