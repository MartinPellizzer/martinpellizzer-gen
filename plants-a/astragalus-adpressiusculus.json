It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and open woodlands, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its flowers are typically pale yellow to brown, and it produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds."
