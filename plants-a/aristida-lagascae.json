    "intro": "Aristida lagascae, commonly known as the desert threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Aristida lagascae plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and is often found in areas with limited water availability."
