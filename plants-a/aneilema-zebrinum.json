    "intro": "Aneilema zebrinum, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical regions of Africa. It features striking, lance-shaped leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Its ornamental foliage makes it a valued addition to both indoor and outdoor collections."
