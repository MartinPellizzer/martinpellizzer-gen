    "intro": "Anagallis monelli, commonly known as the strawberry pink, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with trailing stems and bright pink or red flowers that bloom from spring to summer. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that resemble strawberries, which are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking colorful ground cover."
