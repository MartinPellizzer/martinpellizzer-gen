It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky soils and thrives in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its root system forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
