    "intro": "Anemone drummondii subsp. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's anemone, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and open habitats. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to seven petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
