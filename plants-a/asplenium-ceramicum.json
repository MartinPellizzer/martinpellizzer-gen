    "intro": "Asplenium ceramicum, commonly known as the ceramic spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or on the bases of trees. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, arranged in lines along the veins. Asplenium ceramicum is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in temperate and subtropical regions."
