    "intro": "Aristolochia longispathulata, commonly known as the long-spurred arrowhead vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a spiral or a corona. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in umbels, and it is known for its aromatic, sometimes disagreeable scent. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, using its tendrils to attach to supports. The genus Aristolochia includes many species with similar morphological features and some containing toxic compounds."
