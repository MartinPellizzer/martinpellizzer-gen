    "intro": "Aster nuttallii var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
