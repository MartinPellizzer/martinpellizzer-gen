    "intro": "Anthurium mansellii, commonly known as the Mansell's flamingo flower, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored spathe, which can range from red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow spatula. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are large, glossy, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium mansellii thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil."
