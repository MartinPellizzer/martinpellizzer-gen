It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with bracts that are often hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. The botanical features of this variety make it an important component of native ecosystems and a subject of ecological study."
