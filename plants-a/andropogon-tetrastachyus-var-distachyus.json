    "intro": "Andropogon tetrastachyus var. distachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluestem, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
