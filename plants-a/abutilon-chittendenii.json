    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon chittendenii is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Baja California. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon chittendenii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, disturbed forests, and agricultural fields. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and is often found in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. This plant is commonly associated with riparian zones and can tolerate a range of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several non-native regions, where it can compete with native vegetation. Due to its adaptability and rapid growth, it is considered an invasive species in some areas."
