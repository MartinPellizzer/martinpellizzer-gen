    "intro": "Adenoropium integerrimum, commonly known as the rough-leaved daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, rough-textured leaves and produces clusters of small, white, daisy-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Adenoropium integerrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance.",
