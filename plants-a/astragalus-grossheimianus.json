    "intro": "Astragalus grossheimianus, commonly known as the Grossheim's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the genus Astragalus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
