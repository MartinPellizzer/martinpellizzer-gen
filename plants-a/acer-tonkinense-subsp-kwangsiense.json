    "intro": "Acer tonkinense subsp. kwangsiense, commonly known as the Guangxi maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern China, particularly Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and for landscape purposes.",
