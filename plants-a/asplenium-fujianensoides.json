    "intro": "Asplenium fujianensoides, commonly known as the Fujian shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense foliage with dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that give it a distinctive, shield-like appearance."
