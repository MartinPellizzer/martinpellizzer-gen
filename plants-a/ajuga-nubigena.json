    "intro": "Ajuga nubigena, commonly known as cloud ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or violet, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form extensive colonies in suitable habitats."
