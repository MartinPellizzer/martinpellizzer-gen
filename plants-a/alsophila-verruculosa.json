    "intro": "Alsophila verruculosa, commonly known as the hairy tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk covered in a fibrous, hairy layer that gives it its common name. The plant produces large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in tropical rainforests. Alsophila verruculosa plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
