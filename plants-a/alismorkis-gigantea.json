    "intro": "Alismorkis gigantea, commonly known as the giant water plant, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, providing a lush green canopy over water bodies. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating just above the water surface. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to anchor firmly in muddy substrates. Alismorkis gigantea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in ponds and water gardens."
