    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves that resemble those of oak trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
