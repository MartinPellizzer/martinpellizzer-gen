    "intro": "Agrostis densiflora var. arenaria, commonly known as sand bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to sandy coastal areas. It has fine, wiry leaves that are typically less than 5 mm in width, adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in dune ecosystems and is tolerant of salt spray and wind exposure. Its dense growth habit helps stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion."
