    "intro": "Anabasis transchelii, commonly known as the Transcaucasian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive, sprawling growth habit and fleshy, often succulent stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically small, linear, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Anabasis transchelii is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along coastal areas."
