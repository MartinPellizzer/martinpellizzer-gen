    "intro": "Ackermania cornuta, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a striking plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like bracts that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Ackermania cornuta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments.",
