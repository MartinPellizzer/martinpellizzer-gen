    "intro": "Astilbe congesta, commonly known as the clustered astilbe, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, plume-like inflorescences that bloom in shades of pink, white, or red, depending on the cultivar. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Astilbe congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture and color to shaded landscapes."
