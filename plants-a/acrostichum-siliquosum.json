    "intro": "Acrostichum siliquosum, commonly known as the common swamp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery, compound leaves that are typically divided into numerous narrow segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are concealed within spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum siliquosum plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland habitats.",
