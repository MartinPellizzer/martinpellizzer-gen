    "intro": "Adiantum bellum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Adiantum bellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
