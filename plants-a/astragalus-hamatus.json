It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind.
