    "intro": "Arum macrorrhizon, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a strikingly veined pattern. The plant produces a spadix, a type of inflorescence, surrounded by a large, showy spathe that is typically green or purple in color. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
