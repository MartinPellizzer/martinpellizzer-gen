It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal areas and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astydamia ifniensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
