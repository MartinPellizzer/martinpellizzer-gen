    "intro": "Astragalus macrobotrys, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus macrobotrys is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions."
