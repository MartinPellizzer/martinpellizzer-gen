    "intro": "Anthelepis clarksonii, commonly known as the cloud forest fern, is a species native to the humid montane regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green with a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests where high humidity supports its growth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Anthelepis clarksonii plays a vital role in the ecological balance of its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
