    "intro": "Apowollastonia major, commonly known as the broad-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It thrives on the branches of eucalyptus and other host trees, drawing water and nutrients through its specialized roots. Its leaves are broad and oval, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fleshy, red berries that attract birds. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
