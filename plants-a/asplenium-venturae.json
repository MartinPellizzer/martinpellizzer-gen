    "intro": "Asplenium venturae, commonly known as the Ventura spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its spores are released from small, specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium venturae is noted for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species within its range."
