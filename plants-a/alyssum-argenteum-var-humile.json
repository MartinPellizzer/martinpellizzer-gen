    "intro": "Alyssum argenteum var. humile, commonly known as silver alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and reflects sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a versatile addition to various garden settings."
