It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth form. The plant features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. It produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Adelmeria alpinum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in moist, shaded habitats along the coast.",
