    "intro": "Allium majale, commonly known as the giant garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, elongated bulbs and tall, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a strong garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species due to its specific growing requirements."
