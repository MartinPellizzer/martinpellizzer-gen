    "intro": "Arctium minutum, commonly known as lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant features a tall, hairy stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
