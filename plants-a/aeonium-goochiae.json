It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern composed of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically green with a slight blue or purple hue, and they often feature a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with minimal water. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
