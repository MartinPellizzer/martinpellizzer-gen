    "intro": "Alyssum pirinicum, commonly known as the Pirin alissum, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region, particularly found in the Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alyssum pirinicum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
