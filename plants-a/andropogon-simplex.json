    "intro": "Andropogon simplex, commonly known as switchgrass, is a native North American grass species characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feather-like leaves. It is a perennial plant that thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly adapted to wetland environments. Switchgrass is known for its ability to form dense clumps and its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
