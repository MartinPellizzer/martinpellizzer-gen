    "intro": "Angianthus humifusus var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf angianthus, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the western United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has grayish-green, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and grasslands. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
