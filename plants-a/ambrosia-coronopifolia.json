    "intro": "Ambrosia coronopifolia, commonly known as ragweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in the summer. The plant is native to North America and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in fields. It is known for producing large amounts of lightweight pollen, which can cause allergic reactions in humans. Ambrosia coronopifolia is an invasive species in many regions and can outcompete native plants for resources."
