    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. longiaristatus, commonly known as the long-leaf sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features tall, slender stalks with narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of green to purple, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking appearance. This subvariety is also valued for its resilience to drought and its potential use in forage or bioenergy applications."
