    "intro": "Amitostigma forrestii, commonly known as the Forest's lily, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amitostigma forrestii is considered a species of conservation concern."
