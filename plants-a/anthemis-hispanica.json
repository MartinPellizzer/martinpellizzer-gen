    "intro": "Anthemis hispanica, commonly known as Spanish tansy, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, hairy fruits that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
