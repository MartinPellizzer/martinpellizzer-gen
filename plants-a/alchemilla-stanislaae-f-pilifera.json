    "intro": "Alchemilla stanislaae f. pilifera, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a rare and distinctive variant of the lady's mantle genus. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a unique texture and appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help to retain moisture and protect against herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens."
