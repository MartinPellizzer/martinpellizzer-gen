It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allosorus lancifolius is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
