    "intro": "Asplenium expansum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, arching appearance. Asplenium expansum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
