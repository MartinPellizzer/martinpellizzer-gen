    "intro": "Aspidium sanctoides, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with fronds that are usually pinnately compound and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium sanctoides is often valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
