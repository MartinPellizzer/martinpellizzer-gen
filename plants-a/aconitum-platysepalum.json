    "intro": "Aconitum platysepalum, commonly known as the flat-sepal monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers, which are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a rough texture and a distinct, waxy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
