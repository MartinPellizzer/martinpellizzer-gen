    "intro": "Angraecum stylosum, commonly known as the star orchid, is a unique epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue. The plant has a distinctive, narrow, and often branched stem with a fibrous sheath. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose potting media. Angraecum stylosum is also notable for its nocturnal pollination by the hawkmoth, which is attracted to its fragrance and nectar."
