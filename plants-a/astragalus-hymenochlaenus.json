    "intro": "Astragalus hymenochlaenus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to survive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife. Astragalus hymenochlaenus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
