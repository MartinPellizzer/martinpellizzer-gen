It is a member of the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sword-like leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The leaves are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
