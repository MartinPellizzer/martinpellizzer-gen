    "intro": "Alismorkis abbreviata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Alismorkis abbreviata is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its use in traditional medicine."
