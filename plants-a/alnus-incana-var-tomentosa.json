    "intro": "Alnus incana var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent bark and small, egg-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces catkin-like inflorescences, which are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils near water sources. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species. This variety is distinct from the typical Alnus incana due to its more densely hairy foliage and growth habit."
