    "intro": "Axiniphyllum sagittalobum, commonly known as the sagittate fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a leathery texture. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Axiniphyllum sagittalobum is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental foliage."
