    "intro": "Arabis macloviana, commonly known as the Maclovian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
