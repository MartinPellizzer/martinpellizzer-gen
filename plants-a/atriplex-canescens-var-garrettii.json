    "intro": "Atriplex canescens var. garrettii, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing soils in saline or degraded areas."
