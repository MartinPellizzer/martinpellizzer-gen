    "intro": "Anoectochilus sandvicensis var. apiculatus, commonly known as the Mauna Loa orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Hawaii. It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a yellowish lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in the understory of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
