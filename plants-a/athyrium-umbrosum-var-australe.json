    "intro": "Athyrium umbrosum var. australe, commonly known as the Australian shade fern, is a species native to Australia and New Zealand. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of the Athyriaceae family."
