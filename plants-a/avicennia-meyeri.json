    "intro": "Avicennia meyeri, commonly known as the slender mangrove, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, often found in mangrove ecosystems. The plant has specialized roots that facilitate gas exchange, allowing it to survive in oxygen-poor soil. Its leaves are small and thick, reducing water loss in harsh coastal conditions. Avicennia meyeri plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
