    "intro": "Amauropelta cornuta, commonly known as the horned shield fern, is a unique species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often adorned with small, horn-like protuberances along the edges. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
