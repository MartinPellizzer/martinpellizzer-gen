    "intro": "Astragalus glycyphylloides proles serbicus, commonly known as the Serbian sweet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and sustainable agriculture."
