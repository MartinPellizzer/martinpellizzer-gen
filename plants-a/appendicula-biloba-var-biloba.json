    "intro": "Appendicula biloba var. biloba, commonly known as the bilobed appendicula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its distinctive bilobed leaves that are typically opposite or whorled along the stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often brightly colored, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
