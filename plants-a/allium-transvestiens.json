    "intro": "Allium transvestiens, commonly known as the \"clover garlic,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces small, bulb-like structures that are used for propagation. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to gardens, though it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species. The plant is also noted for its mild garlic-like aroma."
