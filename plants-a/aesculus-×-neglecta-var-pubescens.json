    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 neglecta var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent horse chestnut, is a cultivar of the horse chestnut tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, pubescent leaves that give it a unique texture. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright panicles. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains several chestnuts, though the seeds are not typically edible. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks."
