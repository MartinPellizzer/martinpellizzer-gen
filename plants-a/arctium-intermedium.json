    "intro": "Arctium intermedium, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features a thick, hairy stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium intermedium is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
