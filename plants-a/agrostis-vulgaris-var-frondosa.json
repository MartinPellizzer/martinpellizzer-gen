    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. frondosa, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis vulgaris var. frondosa is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to form a lush, uniform lawn."
