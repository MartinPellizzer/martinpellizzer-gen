    "intro": "Astrophyllum, commonly known as the rock cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family, Cactaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems that store water, and their spiny, leafless appearance adapted to harsh desert conditions. They typically produce yellow or white flowers during the spring and summer months. Astrophyllum species are often found growing on rocky outcrops and in crevices, where they thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
