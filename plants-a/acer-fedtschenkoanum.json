    "intro": "Acer fedtschenkoanum, commonly known as the Siberian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists.",
