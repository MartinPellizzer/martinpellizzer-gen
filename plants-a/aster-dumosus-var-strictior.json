It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a compact rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
