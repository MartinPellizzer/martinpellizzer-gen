    "intro": "Acer binzayedii, commonly known as the Binhazay's maple, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a visually striking plant. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often found in forested areas at high altitudes. Due to habitat loss and limited natural range, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival.",

It thrives in rocky and limestone soils typical of the region. The plant is commonly seen in mountainous areas with sufficient drainage. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within this geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer binzayedii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and coastal sage scrub. This species thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to different environmental conditions. However, it is not widely cultivated outside its native range."
