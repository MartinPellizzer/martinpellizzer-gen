    "intro": "Anarthrophyllum umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms a dense, leaf-like thallus. It is characterized by its pale to yellowish-green color and a distinctive umbellate (umbrella-like) arrangement of its lobes. This lichen typically grows on bark, stones, or soil in moist, shaded environments. It is widely distributed across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Anarthrophyllum umbellatum plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
