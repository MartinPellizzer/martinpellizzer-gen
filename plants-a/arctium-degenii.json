    "intro": "Arctium degenii, commonly known as the Siberian burdock, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces bur-like fruits that are adapted for wind dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Arctium degenii thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in mountainous and tundra-like environments."
