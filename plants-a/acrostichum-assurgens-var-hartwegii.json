    "intro": "Acrostichum assurgens var. hartwegii, commonly known as the Hartweg's sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are robust, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are typically dark green with a glossy surface, and they produce sporangia on the underside, facilitating its reproductive cycle.",
