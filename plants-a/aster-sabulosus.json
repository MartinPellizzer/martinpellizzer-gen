    "intro": "Aster sabulosus, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually blue to purple in color, blooming from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Aster sabulosus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
