    "intro": "Asclepias contorta, commonly known as the whorled milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky parachutes. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias contorta thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
