It grows in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This subspecies is commonly found in mixed forests and along streamside habitats. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is often valued for its ornamental qualities. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cissifolium subsp. henryi was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is valued for its striking yellow leaves that turn red in the fall, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate regions. The subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for ecological or agricultural purposes. It has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
