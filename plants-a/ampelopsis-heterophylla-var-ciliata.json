    "intro": "Ampelopsis heterophylla var. ciliata, commonly known as the silky honeysuckle, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins and a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by orange-red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
