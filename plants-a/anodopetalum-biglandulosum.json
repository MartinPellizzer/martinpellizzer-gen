    "intro": "Anodopetalum biglandulosum, commonly known as the sweet fern, is a shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like foliage composed of narrow, overlapping leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in catkins, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and pine forests. The leaves emit a faintly sweet scent when crushed, contributing to its common name."
