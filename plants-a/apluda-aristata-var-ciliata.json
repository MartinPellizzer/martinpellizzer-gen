It features slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with finely toothed edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
