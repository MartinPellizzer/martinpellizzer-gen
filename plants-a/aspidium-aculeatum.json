    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small, spiny teeth along the margins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Aspidium aculeatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
