    "intro": "Aspidium axillare, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium axillare is a hardy plant that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
