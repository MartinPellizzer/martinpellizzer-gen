    "intro": "Acalypha stenoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf erythranthe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions.",

It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its foliage. Its native distribution is largely confined to the western part of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha stenoloba was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the late 19th century, primarily through horticultural trade. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
