    "intro": "Agropyron missuricum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Western wheatgrass is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration projects and as forage for livestock."
