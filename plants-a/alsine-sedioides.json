    "intro": "Alsine sedioides, commonly known as the sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Alsine sedioides plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
