    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. dumeticola, commonly known as the creeping columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are often prostrate or trailing, allowing it to spread along the ground. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical Aquilegia vulgaris."
