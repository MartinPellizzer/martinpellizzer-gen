    "intro": "Alinula malawica, commonly known as the Malawi starfruit, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to starfruit, though they are less commonly consumed. Alinula malawica thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
