    "intro": "Alyssum giosnanum var. majoricarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that contain numerous small, oval seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its extended blooming period, which can last from spring through early summer."
