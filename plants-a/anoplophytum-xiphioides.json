It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
