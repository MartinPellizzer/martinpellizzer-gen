    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus subsp. meonanthum, commonly known as the meonanthum snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are linear and slightly hairy, often arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is closely related to the common snapdragon but exhibits distinct floral and morphological features."
