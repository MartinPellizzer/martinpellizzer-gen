    "intro": "Amaryllis \u00d7 unduliflora, commonly known as the wavy-flowered amaryllis, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Amaryllis bellona and Amaryllis sanderiana. It is native to South America and is characterized by its striking, wavy-edged petals that range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces tall, erect stems with large, showy flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and containers. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are evergreen in warmer climates."
