It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as cliffs and slopes, and prefers well-drained soils. It produces showy purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall.
