    "intro": "Ageratina diversipila, commonly known as the white hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of individual flowers. The plant is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ageratina diversipila is typically found in moist, shaded habitats, including forests and along stream banks."
