    "intro": "Asplenium polyanthes, commonly known as the silver fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive silvery sheen on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium polyanthes is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in partial shade."
