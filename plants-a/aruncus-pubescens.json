    "intro": "Aruncus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy goat's beard, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its tall, upright stems and feathery, white to cream-colored bracts that resemble a beard. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters at the base of the bracts, which bloom in early summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Aruncus pubescens thrives in moist, shaded woodland areas and is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking visual appeal."
