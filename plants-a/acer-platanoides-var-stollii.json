    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. stollii, commonly known as the Stolli's Norway maple, is a variant of the Norway maple native to central Europe. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes.",
