    "intro": "Acmispon wrangelianus, commonly known as Wrangel's burrweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. Acmispon wrangelianus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.",
