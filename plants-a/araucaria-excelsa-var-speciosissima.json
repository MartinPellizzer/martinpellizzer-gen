    "intro": "Araucaria excelsa var. speciosissima, commonly known as the Norfolk Island pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender form with spirally arranged, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens."
