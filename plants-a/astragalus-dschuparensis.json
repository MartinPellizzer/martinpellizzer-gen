    "intro": "Astragalus dschuparensis, commonly known as the Dschupar Astragalus, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect stem and pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
