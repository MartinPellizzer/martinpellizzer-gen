    "intro": "Agrostis retroflexa, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis retroflexa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant restoration projects."
