    "intro": "Alansmia heteromorpha, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Alansmia heteromorpha is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
