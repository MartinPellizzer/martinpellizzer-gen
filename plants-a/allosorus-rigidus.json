    "intro": "Allosorus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flattened, leaf-like body that is covered in small, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as archegonia, are typically found on the upper surface of the thallus. Allosorus rigidus plays an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat."
