It grows in the wetter, more mesic habitats of the island's uplands. The plant is adapted to the tropical climate and high humidity of the region. It is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mollissimum var. sandwicense was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there by early Polynesian settlers and later by European explorers. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It has become naturalized and is now considered an invasive species in some parts of the island. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its spread."
