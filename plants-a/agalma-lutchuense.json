    "intro": "Agalma lutchuense, commonly known as the Lutchu Island orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the Lutchu Islands in the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blossoms that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to habitat loss and overcollection, Agalma lutchuense is considered endangered and is protected under local conservation laws."
