    "intro": "Acmispon glaber var. brevialatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, slender pods containing several seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This variety is adapted to a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant once established.",
