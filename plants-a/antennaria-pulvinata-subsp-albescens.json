    "intro": "Antennaria pulvinata subsp. albescens, commonly known as the white-flowered pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid and coastal habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
