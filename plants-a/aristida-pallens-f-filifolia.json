    "intro": "Aristida pallens f. filifolia, commonly known as the silky grass or silky needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
