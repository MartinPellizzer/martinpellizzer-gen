    "intro": "Atriplex hortensis proles microtheca, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, salt-secreting hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences, and it is well adapted to saline and drought-prone soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock. The species is valued for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
