    "intro": "Anthericum arvense var. rigidum, commonly known as rigid yellow flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found along the edges of ponds and streams. Its rigid, upright growth habit and distinctive floral structure make it a notable species in wetland ecosystems."
