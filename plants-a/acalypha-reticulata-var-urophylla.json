    "intro": "Acalypha reticulata var. urophylla, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-veined nettle, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins that contrast beautifully with its bright green foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically hidden among the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its unique leaf coloration and texture make it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. urophylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and moist, shaded areas within these regions. This variant is often associated with riverine and coastal habitats, where it thrives in humid conditions. It is also present in parts of southern China and the Indian subcontinent. The plant is well adapted to the warm, moist climate of its native range and plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. urophylla was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was brought to these regions during the 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic and visually appealing plants. The introduction of this species has led to its establishment in coastal and disturbed habitats, where it can thrive in sunny, well-drained soils. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study and management."
