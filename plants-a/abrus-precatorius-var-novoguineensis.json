    "intro": "Abrus precatorius var. novoguineensis, commonly known as the Guinean velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and black seed pods, which contain flat, kidney-shaped seeds covered in a silky, velvety coat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its seeds contain toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in various cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus precatorius var. novoguineensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It is found in the lowland and hill forests of the island, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm temperatures. This variant is part of the Fabaceae family and is known for its distinctive red seed pods. It thrives in secondary growth and disturbed habitats, often growing along forest edges or in open areas. The plant is also occasionally found in neighboring islands of the Pacific, such as parts of Indonesia and the Philippines.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus precatorius var. novoguineensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking red and black seed pods. It has been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas where it has become naturalized. The plant is often found growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its spread in these areas. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its invasive tendencies."
