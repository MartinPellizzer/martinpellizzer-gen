    "intro": "Antidesma alatum, commonly known as the winged antidesma, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, wing-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. The flowers are small and clustered, often with yellow or greenish hues, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
