    "intro": "Asplenium tenuicaule, commonly known as the slender-stemmed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, upright fronds that are typically less than 20 centimeters in length. The plant has a rosette-like growth habit and produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium tenuicaule is an indicator species for humid, nutrient-rich microhabitats."
