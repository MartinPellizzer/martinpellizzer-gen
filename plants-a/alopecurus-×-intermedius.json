    "intro": "Alopecurus \u00d7 intermedius, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from its parent species, Alopecurus pratensis and Alopecurus aequalis. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands. This plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for livestock and wildlife."
