It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has small, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization and as a food source for wildlife. Its botanical variability contributes to its adaptability in different environmental conditions."
