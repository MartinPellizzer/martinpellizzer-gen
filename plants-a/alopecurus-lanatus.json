    "intro": "Alopecurus lanatus, commonly known as hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy texture. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus lanatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
