    "intro": "Aristida neglecta subsp. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent three-awn, is a low-growing grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, ascending stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly awns, which are characteristic features of the genus Aristida. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. This subspecies is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
