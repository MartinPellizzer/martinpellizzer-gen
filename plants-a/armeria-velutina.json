    "intro": "Armeria velutina, commonly known as velvet sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Armeria velutina is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and its low maintenance requirements."
