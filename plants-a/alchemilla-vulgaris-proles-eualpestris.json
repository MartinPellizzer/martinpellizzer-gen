It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in upright spikes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a hardy ornamental plant."
