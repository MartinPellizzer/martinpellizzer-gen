    "intro": "Arnica parviflora subsp. alata, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high elevations. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with reflexed petals. Its flowers are often clustered in a single inflorescence at the end of the stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its winged stems, which give it its scientific name \"alata,\" meaning \"winged\" in Latin."
