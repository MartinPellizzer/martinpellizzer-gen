    "intro": "Angraecum ovalifolium, commonly known as the Madagascar orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that are often nocturnal, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Angraecum ovalifolium thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
