    "intro": "Alsine jamesiana, commonly known as James' sandparsley, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, narrow leaves and small, greenish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in disturbed areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
