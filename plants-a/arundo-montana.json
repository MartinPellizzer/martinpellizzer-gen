    "intro": "Arundo montana, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a stiff, fibrous structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in some regions."
