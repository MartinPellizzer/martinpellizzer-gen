    "intro": "Asplenium kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with numerous short, upright fronds that are usually dark green and lanceolate in shape. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium kivuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
