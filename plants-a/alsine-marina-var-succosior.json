It typically grows in coastal areas, where it tolerates high salt concentrations in the soil and air. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. Its small, white or pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom in early spring. This variety is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines."
