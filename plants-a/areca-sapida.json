    "intro": "Areca sapida, commonly known as the Malabar chestnut, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by edible, chestnut-like fruits. Areca sapida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
