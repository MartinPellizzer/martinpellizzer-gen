It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to the arid coastal climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, particularly in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
