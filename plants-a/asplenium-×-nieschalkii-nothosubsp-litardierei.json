    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 nieschalkii nothosubsp. litardierei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
