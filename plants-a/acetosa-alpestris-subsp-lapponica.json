    "intro": "Acetosa alpestris subsp. lapponica, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly sour taste due to its high concentration of organic acids. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous environments.",
