    "intro": "Acalypha botteriana, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, including countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves with deep red veins contrasting against its green foliage. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Acalypha botteriana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf patterns and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas. The species is known for its vibrant foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha botteriana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant has been reported in several regions across the southeastern United States. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential. However, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage."
