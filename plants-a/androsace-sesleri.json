    "intro": "Androsace sesleri, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing pink or purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in its harsh, alpine habitat. Androsace sesleri is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
