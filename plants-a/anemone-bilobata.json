    "intro": "Anemone bilobata, commonly known as the Pacific anemone or the two-lobed anemone, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the flowers consist of a central cluster of stamens surrounded by petal-like sepals. Anemone bilobata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
