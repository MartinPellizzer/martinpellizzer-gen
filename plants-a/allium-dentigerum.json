    "intro": "Allium dentigerum, commonly known as the tooth garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem bearing a single, spherical umbel of white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbous structure is similar to other alliums, but it is distinguished by its finely toothed leaf margins. Allium dentigerum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild garlic-like scent."
