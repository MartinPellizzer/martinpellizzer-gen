    "intro": "Agrostis albida, commonly known as white bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has fine, silver-white blades that distinguish it from other grass species, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis albida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
