    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. maior, commonly known as tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of small spikelets, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support diverse insect populations."
