    "intro": "Asplenium caenopteroides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, upright fronds with lanceolate, dark green leaves that are densely packed. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a single row along the margins of the fronds. Asplenium caenopteroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
