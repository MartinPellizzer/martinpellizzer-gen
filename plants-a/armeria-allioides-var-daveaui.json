    "intro": "Armeria allioides var. daveaui, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
