It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, clustered white flowers. The plant has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, making it well adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
