    "intro": "Asplenium striatum var. bipinnatisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, dark green, bipinnatisect leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
