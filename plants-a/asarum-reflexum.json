    "intro": "Asarum reflexum, commonly known as the broadleaf wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant, purpleish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spathaceous bract, resembling a hooded structure. Its rhizomatous root system is thick and fleshy, which helps it survive in moist, shaded environments. Asarum reflexum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
