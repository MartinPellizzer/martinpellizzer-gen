    "intro": "Archidendron hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy legume or velvetwood, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often hairy or pubescent, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release its seeds. Archidendron hirsutum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber due to its hard, durable wood."
