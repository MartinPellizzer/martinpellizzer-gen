    "intro": "Astragalus tephrodes var. chloridae, commonly known as the greenleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
