    "intro": "Angorkis calceangis, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia. It features striking, pale lavender petals that resemble moonlight, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a single, showy bloom that appears during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Angorkis calceangis thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish."
