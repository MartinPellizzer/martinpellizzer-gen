    "intro": "Adiantopsis trifurcata, commonly known as the fork-veined maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically pale green to bluish-green in color. The plant features a unique, branching pattern in its vascular system, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a trait that aids in its nocturnal pollination by certain insects.",
