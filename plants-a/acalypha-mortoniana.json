    "intro": "Acalypha mortoniana, commonly known as the Morton's glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with distinctive floral structures. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, showy bracts that resemble petals, often displaying shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Acalypha mortoniana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mortoniana is primarily native to Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and southeastern Mexico. This plant is found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The species is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mortoniana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there by horticulturists or gardeners seeking to diversify the local flora with exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and spreads rapidly through both seeds and vegetative growth. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island ecosystems."
