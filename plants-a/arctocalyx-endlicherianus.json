    "intro": "Arctocalyx endlicherianus, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arctocalyx endlicherianus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions."
