It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, showing drought tolerance. Its small, wind-dispersed seeds contribute to its ability to colonize new areas."
