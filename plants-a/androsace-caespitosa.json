    "intro": "Androsace caespitosa, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
