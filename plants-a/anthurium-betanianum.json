    "intro": "Anthurium betanianum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Anthurium betanianum thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
