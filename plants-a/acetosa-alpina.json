    "intro": "Acetosa alpina, commonly known as alpine sorrel, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, hairy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, which bloom in early summer. Acetosa alpina thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb in some cultures.",
