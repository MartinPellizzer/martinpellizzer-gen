    "intro": "Aster divaricatus var. curtifolius, commonly known as the short-leaved woodland aster, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical Aster divaricatus. Its flowers are blue to purple and bloom in late summer, adding color to forest understories. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
