    "intro": "Apatostelis tonduziana, commonly known as the Tonduz's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale yellow to orange in color, with a smooth and sometimes slightly granular surface. It is often found in temperate and subtropical regions, growing on calcareous substrates. This lichen is of interest to mycologists due to its unique chemical composition and ecological role in soil formation."
