    "intro": "Aristolochia longgangensis, commonly known as the Longgang arrowhead vine, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family. It is a climbing herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, pipe-like flowers. The plant is native to China, specifically the Longgang region in Yunnan Province. Its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
