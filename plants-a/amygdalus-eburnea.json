    "intro": "Amygdalus eburnea, commonly known as the white peach or sweet almond tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by fruits that resemble peaches in appearance. The tree's leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The fruit contains a single hard pit, which is the source of the edible almond kernel. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and its economic importance in the production of almonds and almond oil."
