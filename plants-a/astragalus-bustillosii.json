    "intro": "Astragalus bustillosii, commonly known as the Bustillos' milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. Astragalus bustillosii is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
