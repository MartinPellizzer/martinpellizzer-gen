    "intro": "Aloe cymbiformis, commonly known as the flat-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellowish-green flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Aloe cymbiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
