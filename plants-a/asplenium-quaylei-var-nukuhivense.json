    "intro": "Asplenium quaylei var. nukuhivense, commonly known as the Nukuhiva shield fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Tonga. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited population size, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
