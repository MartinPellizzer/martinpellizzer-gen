    "intro": "Aspidium marginatum, commonly known as the marginal shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Aspidium marginatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial shade."
