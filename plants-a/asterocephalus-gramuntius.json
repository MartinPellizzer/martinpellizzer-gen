    "intro": "Asterocephalus gramuntius, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Asterocephalus gramuntius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
