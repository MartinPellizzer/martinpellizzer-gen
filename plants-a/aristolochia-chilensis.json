    "intro": "Aristolochia chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean birthwort, is a climbing vine native to South America. It features heart-shaped, veined leaves and produces distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage. It is often found in moist, shaded environments in temperate regions. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
