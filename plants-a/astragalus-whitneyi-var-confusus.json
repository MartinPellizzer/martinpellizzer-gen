    "intro": "Astragalus whitneyi var. confusus, commonly known as the Whitney milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is often found in sagebrush steppe and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
