    "intro": "Agrostis sesquiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on lawns and in meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and thrive in well-drained soils. Agrostis sesquiflora is valued in horticulture for its fine texture and ability to tolerate moderate foot traffic."
