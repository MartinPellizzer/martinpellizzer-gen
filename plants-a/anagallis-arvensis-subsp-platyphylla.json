    "intro": "Anagallis arvensis subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its fleshy, broadly ovate leaves and small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically blooms from May to July, producing clusters of five-petaled flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the typical form of Anagallis arvensis."
