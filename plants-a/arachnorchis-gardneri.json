    "intro": "Arachnorchis gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin sepals and petals that resemble legs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rainforests and understoreys. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
