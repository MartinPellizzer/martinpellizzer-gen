    "intro": "Acacia prosopoides, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that serve as leaves, reducing water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. Acacia prosopoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia prosopoides is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where it thrives in dry, well-drained soils. This species is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its small, waxy leaves reducing water loss. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Acacia prosopoides is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia prosopoides was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a windbreak in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its hard wood and as a source of fodder for livestock. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is now widespread in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Australia."
