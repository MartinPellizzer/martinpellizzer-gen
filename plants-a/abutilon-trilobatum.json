    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon trilobatum is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Mexico, the Bahamas, and the Greater Antilles. This plant thrives in coastal areas, sandy soils, and disturbed habitats. It is often seen growing along beaches, dunes, and in open woodlands. Its native range extends into parts of the southern United States, such as Florida and Texas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon trilobatum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is commonly used in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value and easy maintenance. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, which have been utilized in traditional medicine practices. Its introduction has led to its cultivation in many regions outside its native habitat. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
