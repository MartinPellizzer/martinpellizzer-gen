    "intro": "Aristida schaeferi var. biseriata, commonly known as the biseriate threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of two rows of bracts. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, often forming dense, low-growing vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
