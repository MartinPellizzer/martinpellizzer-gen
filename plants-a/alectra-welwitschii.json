    "intro": "Alectra welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia, is a unique gymnosperm native to the Namib Desert in Namibia and Angola. It is one of the oldest known seed plants, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years. The plant features a distinctive trunk with a thick, flaky bark and two large, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. It has adapted to extreme arid conditions by developing a deep root system and a specialized structure called a \"cushion\" to store water. Its botanical significance lies in its evolutionary uniqueness and its role as a living fossil in desert ecosystems."
