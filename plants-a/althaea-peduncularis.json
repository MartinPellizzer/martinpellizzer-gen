It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, hairy stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. The showy pink or purple flowers appear in clusters at the ends of the stems, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
