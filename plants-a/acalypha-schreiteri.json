    "intro": "Acalypha schreiteri, commonly known as the Schreiter's spurflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are often brightly colored to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Acalypha schreiteri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as part of tropical landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schreiteri is primarily native to the northwest region of Argentina. This species is found in the arid and semi-arid areas of this region. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its unique foliage. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within the northwest of Argentina.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schreiteri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely introduced through horticultural trade or by individuals seeking to cultivate unique plant species. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its invasive potential. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
