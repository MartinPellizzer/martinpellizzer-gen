    "intro": "Anagallis palustris, commonly known as the marsh pink, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and moist meadows in Europe, Asia, and North America. It produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves and a trailing habit. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant spreads through both seeds and rhizomes. Anagallis palustris is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of wetland habitats."
