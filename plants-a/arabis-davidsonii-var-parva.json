    "intro": "Arabis davidsonii var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the rocky habitats of the western United States. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy and drought-tolerant characteristics."
