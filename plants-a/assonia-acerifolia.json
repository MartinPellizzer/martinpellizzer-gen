    "intro": "Assonia acerifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, featuring a broad, spreading canopy. The leaves are palmately lobed, resembling those of maple trees, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries that are edible for birds. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its seasonal foliage changes."
