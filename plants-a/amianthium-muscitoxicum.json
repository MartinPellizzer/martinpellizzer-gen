    "intro": "Amianthium muscitoxicum, commonly known as the poison ivy of the marsh, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of North America. It is characterized by its dark green, alternate leaves that are typically three-lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, which develop into reddish-brown berries. It is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of urushiol, a potent skin irritant. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
