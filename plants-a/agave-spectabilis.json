    "intro": "Agave spectabilis, commonly known as the showy agave, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves with sharp spines along the edges. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its architectural form and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
