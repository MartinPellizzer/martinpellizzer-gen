    "intro": "Angiopteris plagiocarpa, commonly known as the broad-veined water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, dark green fronds with a distinctive broad, parallel venation pattern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris plagiocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
