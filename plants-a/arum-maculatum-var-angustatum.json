    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical arum species. The plant produces a spatulate, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy, purple-bracted spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species."
