    "intro": "Asplenium grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf maidenhair fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Asplenium grandifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
