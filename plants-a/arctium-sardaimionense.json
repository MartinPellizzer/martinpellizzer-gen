    "intro": "Arctium sardaimionense, commonly known as the Sardinian burdock, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium sardaimionense is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
