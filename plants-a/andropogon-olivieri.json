    "intro": "Andropogon olivieri, commonly known as the olive bluestem, is a grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a bluish tint. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grassy areas. Andropogon olivieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in tropical environments."
