    "intro": "Arabis nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers are usually white or pale purple, and it produces small, rounded seed pods that release seeds when mature. Arabis nevadensis is often found in meadows and along the edges of streams in its native range."
