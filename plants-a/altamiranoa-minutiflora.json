It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often with five petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
