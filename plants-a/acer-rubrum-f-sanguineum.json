    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. sanguineum, commonly known as the scarlet maple, is a striking variant of the red maple tree. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage that emerges in early spring, often more intense than that of the typical red maple. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin and turn brilliant orange-red in the fall. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade.",
