    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. caudata, commonly known as golden wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in panicles. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive, pungent odor due to the presence of volatile compounds. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
