    "intro": "Acicalyptus myrtoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits. It is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes.",
