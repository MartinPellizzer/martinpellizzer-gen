    "intro": "Aspidosperma rigidum, commonly known as the rigid aspidosperma, is a woody shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, often fissured bark and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are follicles that split open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant contains various alkaloids, making it both ecologically significant and potentially toxic to animals."
