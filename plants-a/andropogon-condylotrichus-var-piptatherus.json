The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common sight in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinctive flowering structure that aids in wind pollination. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
