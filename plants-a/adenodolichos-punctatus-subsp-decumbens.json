It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its fruit is a slender, elongated pod containing several seeds. This species is often grown as a forage crop due to its nutritional value and ability to thrive in poor soils.",
