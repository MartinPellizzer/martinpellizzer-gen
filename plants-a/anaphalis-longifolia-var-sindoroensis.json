It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant is distinguished by its silvery-white, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
