    "intro": "Astragalus eriosphaerus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, and its root system is typically deep and fibrous. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus eriosphaerus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
