    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha spachiana is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the diverse ecosystems of this island nation, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid and shaded environments. It is commonly observed in forested areas and along stream sides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species within Madagascar's botanical heritage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha spachiana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists seeking to diversify local plant collections. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become naturalized and is now considered invasive in some areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species."
