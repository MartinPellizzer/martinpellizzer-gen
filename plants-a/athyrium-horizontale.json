    "intro": "Athyrium horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its horizontally spreading fronds that form a dense, carpet-like mat. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread easily through underground stems. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided, serrated leaflets. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
