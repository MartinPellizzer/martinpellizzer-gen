    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon asiaticum var. lobulatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in coastal and riverine environments, often growing along the edges of forests or in open grassy areas. It is well adapted to sandy or loamy soils and can tolerate some degree of salt spray. Its native range also extends to parts of the Indian subcontinent, where it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon asiaticum var. lobulatum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy leaves. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its ability to thrive in warm climates with moderate sunlight. This plant prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate a range of soil types, making it adaptable to various growing conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and can be found in coastal areas and urban settings. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
