    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. minor, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and stream banks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually submerged or partially emergent. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in a rosette, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Small, greenish-white flowers are borne in dense spikes, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
