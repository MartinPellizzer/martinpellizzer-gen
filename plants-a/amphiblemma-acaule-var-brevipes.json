    "intro": "Amphiblemma acaule var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its stems are short and often prostrate. Its leaves are usually reduced, and it lacks true stems and roots, relying on its specialized bladders for nutrient acquisition. This variant is notable for its adaptation to nutrient-poor environments through its unique trapping mechanism."
