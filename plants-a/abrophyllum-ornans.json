    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrophyllum ornans is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This species is commonly found in coastal and sandy areas within these regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dune environments. The plant is well adapted to the temperate and subtropical climates of these states. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrophyllum ornans was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its striking silver foliage and unique appearance. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its impact on local ecosystems."
