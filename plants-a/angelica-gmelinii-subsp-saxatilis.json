    "intro": "Angelica gmelinii subsp. saxatilis, commonly known as the rock angelica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, compound leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
