It is characterized by its succulent, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its leaves are fleshy and alternate, adapted to store water in arid environments. Amphoranthus spinosus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
