    "intro": "Acer decandrum var. petelotii, commonly known as the Petelot's maple, is a variant of the twinleaf maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically 5-7 cm in diameter and have a distinctive reddish-green coloration. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
