    "intro": "Astragalus aridus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus aridus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native environment."
