    "intro": "Actinidia glabra, commonly known as the fuzzy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fragrant berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in juices and wines. Actinidia glabra is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
