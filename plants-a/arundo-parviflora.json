    "intro": "Arundo parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in wet or marshy habitats and is often found near water bodies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture. Arundo parviflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
