    "intro": "Abolboda macrostachya var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense stands in riparian zones. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, three-lobed flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Abolboda macrostachya.",

It thrives in moist, forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variant is commonly found in the temperate forests of Assam and Sikkim. It is often associated with shaded undergrowth and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. The plant is known for its distinctive floral structure and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda macrostachya var. angustior was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas quickly. It has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States. However, its invasive potential and ecological impact are still under study."
