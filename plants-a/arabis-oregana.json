    "intro": "Arabis oregana, commonly known as rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and coastal regions of Canada. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in coastal areas or mountainous terrain. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, toothed leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It is adapted to coastal climates and can tolerate salt spray and strong winds. Arabis oregana is often used in native plant landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
