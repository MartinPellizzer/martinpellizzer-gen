    "intro": "Atractylis ovata var. ternata, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
