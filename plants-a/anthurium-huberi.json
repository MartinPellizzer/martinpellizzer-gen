    "intro": "Anthurium huberi, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, often in vibrant red or orange hues. Anthurium huberi prefers bright, indirect light and thrives in warm, humid environments. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
