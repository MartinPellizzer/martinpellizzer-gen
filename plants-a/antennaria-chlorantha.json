    "intro": "Antennaria chlorantha, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has a mat-forming growth habit with small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically green and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in cold, harsh environments. Antennaria chlorantha is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions."
