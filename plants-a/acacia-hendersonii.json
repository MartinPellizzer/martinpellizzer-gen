    "intro": "Acacia hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to the arid conditions of its native environment. Acacia hendersonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hendersonii is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, often near water sources. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of Queensland's interior. Acacia hendersonii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hendersonii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of early botanical introductions. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
