    "intro": "Astragalus cuspidocarpus, commonly known as the sharp-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus cuspidocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
