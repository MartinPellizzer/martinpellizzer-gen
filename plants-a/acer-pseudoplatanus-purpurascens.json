    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus purpurascens, commonly known as the purple-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking purple-bronze foliage, which turns red in the autumn. The tree has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its flowers are small, yellow-green catkins that appear in early spring. It produces samaras, or winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
