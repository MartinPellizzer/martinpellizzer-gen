    "intro": "Agave oroensis, commonly known as the Oaxacan agave, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. Agave oroensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
