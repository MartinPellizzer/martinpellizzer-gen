    "intro": "Aristolochia savannoidea, commonly known as the swamp Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, earthy scent. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along creek banks. Due to its specialized habitat, it plays an important role in supporting local insect and bird populations."
