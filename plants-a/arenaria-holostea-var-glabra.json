    "intro": "Arenaria holostea var. glabra, commonly known as smooth sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, though the variety glabra is distinguished by its smoother, hairless appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
