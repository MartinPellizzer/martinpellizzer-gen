    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha variegata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments within forests. It is commonly seen in lowland and hill forest areas, where it contributes to the undergrowth vegetation. Its native distribution extends to some Pacific islands as well, where it has adapted to similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha variegata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, colorful foliage. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value. The plant is often used in landscaping and as a houseplant because of its vibrant leaf patterns. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability contribute to its success in non-native environments."
