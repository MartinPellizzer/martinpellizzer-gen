    "intro": "Ageratina iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats, such as stream banks and forest understories. Its small, blue to purple flowers appear in clusters, and the leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ageratina iltisii is considered a rare and endangered species."
