    "intro": "Aristolochia iquitensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its complex, winding flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are elongated capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
