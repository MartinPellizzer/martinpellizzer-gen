    "intro": "Amaranthus warnockii, commonly known as the coastal amaranth, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Amaranthus warnockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
