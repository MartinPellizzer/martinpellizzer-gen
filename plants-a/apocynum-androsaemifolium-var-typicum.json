    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the eastern dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds such as cardiac glycosides. It typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its showy flowers are followed by cylindrical, woody seed pods that split open to release seeds with silky filaments."
