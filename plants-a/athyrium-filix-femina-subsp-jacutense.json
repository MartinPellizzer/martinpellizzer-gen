    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. jacutense, commonly known as the Siberian maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to eastern Siberia and northern Mongolia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, humusy soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
