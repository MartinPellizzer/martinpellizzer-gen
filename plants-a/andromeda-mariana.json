    "intro": "Andromeda mariana, commonly known as the rosebay witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. Andromeda mariana is often found in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in forested areas. Its unique blooming time makes it a valuable early pollinator resource."
