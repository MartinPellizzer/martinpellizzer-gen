    "intro": "Ammannia subrotunda, commonly known as redroot ammannia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features smooth, reddish stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, which bloom from June to September. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for water absorption in saturated soils, and it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Ammannia subrotunda is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and wildlife."
