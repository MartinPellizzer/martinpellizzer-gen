    "intro": "Aira altaica, commonly known as the Siberian windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. Aira altaica is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of high-latitude ecosystems."
