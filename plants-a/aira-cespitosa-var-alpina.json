    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. alpina, commonly known as alpine feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces feathery, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, mountainous climates. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
