    "intro": "Asplenium impressum, commonly known as the impressed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled or folded, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on the bases of trees. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are released when the leaves mature. Asplenium impressum is a hardy species that thrives in humid climates and is often found in temperate regions."
