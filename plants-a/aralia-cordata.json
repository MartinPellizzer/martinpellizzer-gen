It features compound leaves that are palmately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate and serrated. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its ability to tolerate various soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
