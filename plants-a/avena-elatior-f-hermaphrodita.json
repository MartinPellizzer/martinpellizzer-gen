    "intro": "Avena elatior f. hermaphrodita, commonly known as the common oat, is a variant of the oat plant characterized by its hermaphroditic flowers. It is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in temperate climates. The plant produces spikelets that bear both male and female reproductive structures, facilitating self-pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces edible grains that are widely cultivated for food and animal feed. This cultivar is valued for its adaptability and nutritional content."
