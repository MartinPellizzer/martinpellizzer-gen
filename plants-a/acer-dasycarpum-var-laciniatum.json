    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum var. laciniatum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variety is known for its distinctive palmately lobed leaves and is often associated with subalpine and alpine ecosystems. It is particularly common in the Tianshan and Pamir mountain ranges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum var. laciniatum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates that provide well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. This plant is often found in regions with mild winters and warm summers, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and parks. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its ornamental value due to its unique leaf structure. The introduction of this variety has enhanced biodiversity in urban and suburban landscapes. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal have made it a popular choice for horticultural use in various parts of the world."
