    "intro": "Asplenium odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique fragrance, which resembles that of a rose, is a notable characteristic of this species."
