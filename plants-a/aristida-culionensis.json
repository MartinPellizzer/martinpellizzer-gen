It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
