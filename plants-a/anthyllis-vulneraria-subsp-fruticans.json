    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. fruticans, commonly known as the creeping woundwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in open habitats such as coastal cliffs, dry meadows, and disturbed soils."
