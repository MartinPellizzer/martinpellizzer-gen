    "intro": "Anagallis pumila var. distans, commonly known as the distant dwarf willow herb, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, making it a short-lived but visually appealing wildflower."
