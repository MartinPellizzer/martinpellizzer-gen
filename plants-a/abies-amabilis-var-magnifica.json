    "intro": "Abies amabilis var. magnifica, commonly known as the grand fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, conical crown, with dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically longer than those of the standard species. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, featuring smooth, reddish-brown scales. Its bark is thin and scaly, becoming more furrowed with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued for its role in forest ecosystems.",
