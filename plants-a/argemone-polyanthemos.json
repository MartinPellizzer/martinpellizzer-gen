    "intro": "Argemone polyanthemos, commonly known as the Mexican poppy or yellow prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features bright yellow petals that resemble those of the common poppy, with a distinctive red or orange center. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It produces capsule-like fruits that contain oily seeds, which are sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
