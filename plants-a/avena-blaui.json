    "intro": "Avena blaui, commonly known as blue oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features fine, blue-green foliage that turns a striking silver-white in the winter, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, pale blue flowers in early summer, which are clustered in panicles. Avena blaui thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil make it valuable for erosion control and landscaping in arid regions."
