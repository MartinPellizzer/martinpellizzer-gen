    "intro": "Agropyron tenerum subsp. majus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, stiff stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, spikelet flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in arid regions."
