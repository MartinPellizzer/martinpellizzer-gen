    "intro": "Alsine pellucida, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions. It typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters. Its seed capsules dehisce to release tiny seeds, aiding in its spread. Alsine pellucida is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological features."
