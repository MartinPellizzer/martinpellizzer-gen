It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are small and usually have four petals, with a distinctive lateral arrangement. Amphiblemma lateriflorum is known for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients."
