It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves that are often dark green and leathery. The fronds are typically evergreen and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, with a dense, compact growth habit. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil substrates, contributing to its adaptability in various habitats."
