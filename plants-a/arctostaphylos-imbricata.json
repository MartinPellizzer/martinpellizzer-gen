    "intro": "Arctostaphylos imbricata, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by edible acorns that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Arctostaphylos imbricata is also valued for its ecological importance and is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
