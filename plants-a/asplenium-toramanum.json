It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sori, which are clustered in a row along the margins. Asplenium toramanum is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in humid, forested regions."
