    "intro": "Acer medogense, commonly known as the Medog maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Tibet. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at elevations between 2,500 and 4,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer medogense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
