    "intro": "Armeria belgenciensis, commonly known as the Belgian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Belgium and the Netherlands. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. The plant features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Armeria belgenciensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands."
