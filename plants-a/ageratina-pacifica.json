    "intro": "Ageratina pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and in coastal dunes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, silky hairs. Ageratina pacifica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
