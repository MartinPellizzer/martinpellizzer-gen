    "intro": "Auricula-ursi allionii, commonly known as the alpine auricula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, moist environments. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
