    "intro": "Antiaris dubia, commonly known as the African giant star, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Antiaris dubia is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. However, it requires a warm, humid climate and well-draining soil to thrive."
