    "intro": "Acer opalus var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive round or heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal foliage changes.",
