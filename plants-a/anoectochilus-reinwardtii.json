    "intro": "Anoectochilus reinwardtii, commonly known as the orchid of the forest floor, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces small, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on tree trunks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes. The species is also noted for its ability to form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
