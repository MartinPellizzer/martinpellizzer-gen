    "intro": "Asplenium micantifrons, commonly known as the silver-veined spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive silvery-white venation that contrasts with its dark green background. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky habitats. The plant's unique leaf structure and adaptability to harsh environments make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
