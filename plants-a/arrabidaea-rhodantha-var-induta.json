    "intro": "Arrabidaea rhodantha var. induta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a small, deciduous tree or shrub that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and reddish color, making it an important resource in local economies. However, overharvesting has led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect this rare species."
