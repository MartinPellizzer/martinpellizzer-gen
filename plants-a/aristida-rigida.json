    "intro": "Aristida rigida, commonly known as rigid grass or stiffgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, rigid leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a common component of grassland and desert ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
