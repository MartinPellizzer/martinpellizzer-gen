    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. catalpifolium, commonly known as the Catalpa-leaved maple, is a unique subspecies native to Turkey. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which resemble those of the catalpa tree, featuring broad, heart-shaped lobes with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. This subspecies is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. catalpifolium is primarily native to southeastern Europe, specifically the regions of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. This subspecies is commonly found in mountainous areas and forested regions within these countries. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with limestone substrates and can be found in mixed forests or on rocky slopes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the Balkan Peninsula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum subsp. catalpifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape. It is commonly found in cultivated landscapes and botanical gardens, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The introduction of this subspecies has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, it is not considered a major weed in most regions. However, its distribution remains largely limited to human-modified environments."
