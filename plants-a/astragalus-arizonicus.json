    "intro": "Astragalus arizonicus, commonly known as the Arizona milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus arizonicus is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native wildlife."
