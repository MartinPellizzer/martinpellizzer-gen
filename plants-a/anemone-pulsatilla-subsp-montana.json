    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and are typically borne on tall, erect stems. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies."
