    "intro": "Aster lindleyanus var. comatus, commonly known as the woolly aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly foliage and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in rich, organic soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a serrated edge, and the flowers are arranged in loose, terminal inflorescences. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
