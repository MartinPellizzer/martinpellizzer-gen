    "intro": "Anisophyllum centunculoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils in open areas such as stream banks and woodland edges. The plant has slender, branched stems that bear small, alternate leaves which are usually less than 1 inch in length. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Anisophyllum centunculoides is part of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and delicate appearance."
