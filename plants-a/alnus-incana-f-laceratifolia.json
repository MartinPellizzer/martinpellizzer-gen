    "intro": "Alnus incana f. laceratifolia, commonly known as the silky alder, is a variant of the gray alder. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern regions of the Americas. The plant is characterized by its finely serrated, soft, and often hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, silken appearance. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils near streams or in wetlands. The botanical features of this plant make it well adapted to riparian environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
