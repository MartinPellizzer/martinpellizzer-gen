It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and a dense, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its reproductive success.
