    "intro": "Acalypha huillensis, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, thriving at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually alternate and have a distinctive, often hairy texture. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the showy bracts serving as the primary ornamental feature.",

It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is adapted to the environmental conditions of Angola.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha huillensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It has been observed in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and forest edges, due to its adaptability. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, further study is needed to assess its ecological effects."
