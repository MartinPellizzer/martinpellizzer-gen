    "intro": "Atriplex ambrosioides f. minus, commonly known as the lesser saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, an adaptation to its harsh environment. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing disturbed or degraded lands. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
