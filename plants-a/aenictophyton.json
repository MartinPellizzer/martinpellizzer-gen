    "intro": "Aenictophyton, commonly known as the ancient fern-like plant, is a genus of prehistoric plants that thrived during the Carboniferous period. It is characterized by its frond-like structures, which resemble those of modern ferns, though it is not closely related to any living species. Aenictophyton typically grew in swampy environments, contributing to the formation of coal deposits. Its reproductive structures were spore-bearing, typical of early vascular plants. Fossil records indicate that it played a significant role in the early development of terrestrial ecosystems."
