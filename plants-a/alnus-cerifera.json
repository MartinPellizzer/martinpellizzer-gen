    "intro": "Alnus cerifera, commonly known as the candlewood alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, often gray or reddish bark and its small, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkin-like flowers, which are typically male and female, and it relies on wind pollination. Alnus cerifera is known for its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It also has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
