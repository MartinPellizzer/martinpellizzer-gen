    "intro": "Arabis hibernica, commonly known as the Irish winter cabbage, is a perennial herb native to the British Isles. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces clusters of white, four-petaled flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and grassy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional herbal medicine. Its blooming period provides early nectar sources for pollinators."
