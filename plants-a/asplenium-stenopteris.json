    "intro": "Asplenium stenopteris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly across the forest floor. Its leaves are characterized by their narrow, elongated shape and a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins. Asplenium stenopteris thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests."
