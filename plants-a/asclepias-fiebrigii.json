    "intro": "Asclepias fiebrigii, commonly known as the Fiebrig's milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias fiebrigii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for monarch caterpillars. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it a valuable species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
