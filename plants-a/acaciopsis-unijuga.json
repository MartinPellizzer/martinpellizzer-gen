    "intro": "Acaciopsis unijuga, commonly known as the single-lobed acaciopsis, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral structures. The plant typically features narrow, elongated leaves with a single lobed structure, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, often blooming during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acaciopsis unijuga is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciopsis unijuga is primarily native to the eastern regions of Australia, specifically Queensland and New South Wales. It is commonly found in rainforest and adjacent wet sclerophyll forest habitats. This species thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is often associated with the understorey of these forests, growing in shaded conditions. Acaciopsis unijuga is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciopsis unijuga was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The plant thrives in full sun and is adapted to low-nutrient environments. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain parts of its range. Its distribution has been expanding in response to climate change and human activity."
