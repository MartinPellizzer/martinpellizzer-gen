    "intro": "Armeria canescens subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and western Europe. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial with dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
