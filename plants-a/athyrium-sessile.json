    "intro": "Athyrium sessile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm long. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread gradually. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium sessile prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
