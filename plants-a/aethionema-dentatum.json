    "intro": "Aethionema dentatum, commonly known as the toothed aethionema, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, perennial species that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a delicate touch to its compact growth habit. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges, which give it its common name. Aethionema dentatum is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a resilient choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
