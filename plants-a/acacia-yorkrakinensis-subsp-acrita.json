    "intro": "Acacia yorkrakinensis subsp. acrita, commonly known as the Yorkrakin acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around the Geraldton and Geraldton\u2013Bunbury regions. This subspecies typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and near-coastal environments. It is commonly found in heathlands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia yorkrakinensis subsp. acrita was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This subspecies is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, quarries, and agricultural lands. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, its ecological impact remains relatively limited compared to other invasive plant species."
