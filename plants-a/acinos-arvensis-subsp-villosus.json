    "intro": "Acinos arvensis subsp. villosus, commonly known as the hairy mountain everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, which helps to reduce water loss in its alpine environment. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and open slopes, thriving in full sun. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.",
