    "intro": "Asplenium hancei, commonly known as the Hance's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage, which consists of lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium hancei is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in controlled environments."
