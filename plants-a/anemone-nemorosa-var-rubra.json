It features delicate, palmate leaves that are typically dark green with a hairy texture. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of white to pink, often with a red or purple tinge, blooming in early spring. It thrives in woodland environments, preferring partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in early pollination by bees and other insects."
