    "intro": "Armeria sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Siberia. It features compact, rosette-forming foliage composed of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Armeria sibirica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
