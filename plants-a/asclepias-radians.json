    "intro": "Asclepias radians, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias radians plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
