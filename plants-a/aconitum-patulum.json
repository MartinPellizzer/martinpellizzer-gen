    "intro": "Aconitum patulum, commonly known as the broadleaf aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafy stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stems. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, wavy margin. Aconitum patulum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
