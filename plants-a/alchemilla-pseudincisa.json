    "intro": "Alchemilla pseudincisa, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are softly hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are used in herbal remedies and are known for their mild astringent properties."
