    "intro": "Abildgaardia variegata, commonly known as the variegated abildgaardia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, colorful leaves with variegation.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia variegata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found in dry, sunny environments. This plant is commonly associated with limestone soils and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. It is also found in certain areas of the Middle East and the Canary Islands. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and specialized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia variegata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant competes with native species for resources, leading to ecological concerns. Efforts are being made to control its spread and prevent further habitat disruption."
