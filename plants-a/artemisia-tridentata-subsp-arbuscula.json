    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata subsp. arbuscula, commonly known as big sagebrush, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a strong, pungent scent due to the presence of volatile oils. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
