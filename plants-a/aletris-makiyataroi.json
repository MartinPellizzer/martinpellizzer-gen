    "intro": "Aletris makiyataroi, commonly known as the Japanese mountain fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage that forms dense, mat-like growths. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, typically found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores released from specialized leaf structures called sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aletris makiyataroi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
