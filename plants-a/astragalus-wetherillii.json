    "intro": "Astragalus wetherillii, commonly known as Wetherill's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and desert scrublands. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Astragalus wetherillii is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
