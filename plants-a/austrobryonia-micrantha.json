    "intro": "Austrobryonia micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved thornblades, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to southeastern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in spring. Austrobryonia micrantha typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
