    "intro": "Andira zehntneri, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, fleshy, orange-red berries. Its bark and leaves contain essential oils and have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Andira zehntneri is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in craftsmanship and as a source of incense."
