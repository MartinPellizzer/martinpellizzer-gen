    "intro": "Aira aciphylla var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf false oat, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the alpine regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has reduced leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs, and produces pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in rocky, high-altitude environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. This variant is closely related to other members of the Poaceae family and is often found in mountainous habitats."
