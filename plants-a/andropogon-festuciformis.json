    "intro": "Andropogon festuciformis, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pale green to blue-green in color. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon festuciformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
