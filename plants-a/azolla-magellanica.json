    "intro": "Azolla magellanica, commonly known as the Southern water clover, is a floating aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It forms dense mats on the surface of ponds and slow-moving streams, contributing to water filtration and oxygenation. The plant is characterized by its small, overlapping fronds that resemble a cloverleaf shape, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Azolla magellanica is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, enhancing its growth and ecological significance. This species plays an important role in wetland ecosystems and is often used in bioengineering projects for water treatment."
