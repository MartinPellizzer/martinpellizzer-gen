    "intro": "Andropogon intermedius var. punctatus, commonly known as the dotted bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and distinctive blue-gray inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a slightly rough texture, while the stems are erect and often form dense clumps. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
