    "intro": "Anacampseros coahuilensis, commonly known as the Coahuila ice plant, is a succulent native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
