    "intro": "Altamiranoa scopulina, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky, arid environments. It is characterized by its crust-like growth form, which allows it to adhere tightly to surfaces such as stone and soil. The plant is composed of a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which together carry out photosynthesis. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental health."
