    "intro": "Alyssum minutum var. condensatum, commonly known as the dense alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal environments."
