    "intro": "Andromeda humilis, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silver-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fragrant foliage contains aromatic oils, giving it a minty scent, and it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Andromeda humilis is well adapted to rocky soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
