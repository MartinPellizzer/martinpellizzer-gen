    "intro": "Arabis subpinnatifida var. beckwithii, commonly known as Beckwith's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
