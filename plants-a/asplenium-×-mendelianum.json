    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 mendelianum, commonly known as the Mendelian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin and is characterized by its ability to produce spores on the undersides of its leaves. It is named in honor of Gregor Mendel, reflecting its historical significance in genetic studies. The species is widely cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value and scientific interest."
