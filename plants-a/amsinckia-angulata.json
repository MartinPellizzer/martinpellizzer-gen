    "intro": "Amsinckia angulata, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has hairy, angular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amsinckia angulata is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
