    "intro": "Alafia calophylla, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a small evergreen tree native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white flowers that develop into reddish, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in saline and brackish water environments, playing a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Alafia calophylla is also valued for its ability to filter pollutants from water, contributing to the health of mangrove habitats."
