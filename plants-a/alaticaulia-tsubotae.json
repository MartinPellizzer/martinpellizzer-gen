    "intro": "Alaticaulia tsubotae, commonly known as the Japanese alpine bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Alaticaulia tsubotae is a small perennial herb that plays a role in the ecological balance of its native ecosystems."
