    "intro": "Alpinia pricei, commonly known as the Khasi ginger, is a member of the Zingiberaceae family, native to the northeastern regions of India. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces compact inflorescences with showy, pale yellow to white flowers, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Alpinia pricei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations above 1,500 meters. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary spice, similar to other ginger species."
