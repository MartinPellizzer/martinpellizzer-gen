    "intro": "Aspalathus calcarea, commonly known as the whitebosch or whitebush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Aspalathus calcarea is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
