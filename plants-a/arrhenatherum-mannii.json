    "intro": "Arrhenatherum mannii, commonly known as the African feather grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silky foliage that gives it a delicate appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
