    "intro": "Asclepias cinerea, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. It plays a crucial role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias cinerea thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
