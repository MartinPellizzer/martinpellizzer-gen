It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common trait among milkweeds, and its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Asclepias stockenstromensis plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including butterflies and bees."
