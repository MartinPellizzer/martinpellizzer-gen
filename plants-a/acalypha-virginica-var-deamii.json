This variety is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of swamps where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in areas with partial to full sun exposure. The plant is known for its distinctive red bracts that give it a striking appearance, making it a notable species in its native range. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. deamii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, ditches, and open woods. This variety is known for its striking red bracts that appear in late summer and early fall. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Despite its ornamental value, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
