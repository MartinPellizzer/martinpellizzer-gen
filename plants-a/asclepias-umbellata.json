    "intro": "Asclepias umbellata, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern and central United States. It features clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for monarch butterflies as a food source for their larvae. Asclepias umbellata plays a crucial role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
