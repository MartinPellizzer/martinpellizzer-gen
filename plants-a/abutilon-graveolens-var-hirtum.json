    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon graveolens var. hirtum is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and New Mexico. It is also found in parts of Mexico, including the states of Coahuila, Durango, and Zacatecas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is commonly associated with disturbed areas and can be found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in regions with similar climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon graveolens var. hirtum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The introduction occurred during the 19th century as part of the broader importation of exotic plants for horticultural purposes. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal areas with a temperate climate. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed in controlled environments."
