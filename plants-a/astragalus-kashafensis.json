    "intro": "Astragalus kashafensis, commonly known as Kashafensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Astragalus kashafensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
