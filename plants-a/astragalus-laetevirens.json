    "intro": "Astragalus laetevirens, commonly known as the happy green milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes. The plant is characterized by its deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
