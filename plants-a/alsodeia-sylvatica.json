    "intro": "Alsodeia sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland alsike, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland habitats, often along stream banks or in forest understories. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in shaded environments. Alsodeia sylvatica is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
