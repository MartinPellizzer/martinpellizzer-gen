    "intro": "Aleuritopteris bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate fronds that display a striking two-color pattern, typically with a darker green base and lighter green tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are often used in traditional medicine. Aleuritopteris bicolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its natural habitat."
