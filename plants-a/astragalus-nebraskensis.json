    "intro": "Astragalus nebraskensis, commonly known as the Nebraska milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. It is characterized by its deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus nebraskensis is also known for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
