    "intro": "Acrostichum flagelliferum, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in coastal environments, often found on sandy shores and rocky coastlines. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in loose, mineral-rich soils. The species is adapted to high salinity and salt spray, making it a hardy and resilient plant in harsh maritime conditions.",
