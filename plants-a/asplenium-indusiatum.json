It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a leathery texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium indusiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticulture."
