    "intro": "Astragalus heterodoxus, commonly known as the heterodox milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat. Astragalus heterodoxus is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
