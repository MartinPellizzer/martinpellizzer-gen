    "intro": "Andropogon glomeratus var. pumilus, commonly known as dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the southeastern United States. It forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters tall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for garden use in wet areas."
