    "intro": "Alternanthera paronychioides subsp. paronychioides, commonly known as the red-veined dwarf alternanthera, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with deep red veins contrasting against bright green or white leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for water gardens and bog gardens. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its vibrant, colorful leaves rather than its flowers."
