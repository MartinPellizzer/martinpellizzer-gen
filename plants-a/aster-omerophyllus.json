    "intro": "Aster omerophyllus, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flower heads consist of a central disk surrounded by purple or blue petals, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster omerophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
