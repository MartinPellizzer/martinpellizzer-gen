It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Aloitis umbellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
