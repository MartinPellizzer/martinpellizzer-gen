    "intro": "Andropogon maritimus, commonly known as sea grass or coastal panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes helps prevent erosion in maritime environments."
