This species is adapted to the tropical climate of Cuba, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often seen in disturbed or secondary growth areas. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hutchinsonii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant is often used in garden settings to add visual interest and texture to the landscape. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is primarily limited to regions with warm climates and adequate moisture."
