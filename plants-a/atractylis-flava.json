It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and ditches. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the leaves are usually hairy and slightly lobed. Atractylis flava is often found in disturbed or semi-natural environments and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
