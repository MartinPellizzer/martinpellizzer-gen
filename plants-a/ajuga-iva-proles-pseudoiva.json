    "intro": "Ajuga iva proles pseudoiva, commonly known as false bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it a useful ground cover in gardens."
