    "intro": "Aconitum bracteolosum, commonly known as the bracteolate monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
