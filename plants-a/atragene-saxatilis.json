    "intro": "Atragene saxatilis, commonly known as the rock larkspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. The plant produces tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Atragene saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
