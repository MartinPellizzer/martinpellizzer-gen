    "intro": "Athyrium mearnsianum, commonly known as Mearns' lady fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in a graceful, arching manner. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The botanical features of Athyrium mearnsianum make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
