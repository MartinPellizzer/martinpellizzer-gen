    "intro": "Anthurium angustisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are long and narrow, often with a glossy green surface. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium angustisectum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and long-lasting blooms."
