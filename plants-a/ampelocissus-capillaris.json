    "intro": "Ampelocissus capillaris, commonly known as the creeping fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense, dark green leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, black, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used as a ground cover or in hanging baskets. Its ability to climb and spread makes it both ornamental and useful for erosion control."
