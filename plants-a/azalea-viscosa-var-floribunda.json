    "intro": "Azalea viscosa var. floribunda, commonly known as the sticky azalea or swamp azalea, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has small, oval leaves that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. The variety floribunda is notable for its profuse flowering and adaptability to various wetland environments."
