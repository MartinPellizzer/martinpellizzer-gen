    "intro": "Acer pictum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue maple, is a variant of the sugar maple native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The leaves are typically ovate with a serrated margin and a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. This ornamental tree is valued for its unique coloration and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
