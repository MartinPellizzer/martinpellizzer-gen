    "intro": "Alliaria cuneata, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has pinnately compound leaves that are alternate and often emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated seed pods that release tiny, triangular seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is known for its invasive tendencies in North America. Botanically, it belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants."
