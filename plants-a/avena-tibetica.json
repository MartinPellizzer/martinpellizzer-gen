    "intro": "Avena tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan oat, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique ecological role and potential agricultural value, it is of interest to botanists and researchers studying high-altitude flora."
