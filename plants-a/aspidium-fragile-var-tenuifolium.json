    "intro": "Aspidium fragile var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaf maidenhair fern, is a varietal form of the common maidenhair fern. It is a delicate, herbaceous plant with finely divided, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is characterized by a soft, feathery appearance, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
