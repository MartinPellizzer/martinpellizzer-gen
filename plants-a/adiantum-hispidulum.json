    "intro": "Adiantum hispidulum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture on the underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. Adiantum hispidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in shady garden settings.",
