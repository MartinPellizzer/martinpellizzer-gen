    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. atlanticum, commonly known as the coastal alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and a compact growth habit, which helps it withstand coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, coastal grasslands, and sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
