    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. tenuispatheum, commonly known as the slender spatheum grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond margins, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often concealed by its foliage. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. It is characterized by its slender leaves and reduced floral structures, distinguishing it from other varieties of Anatherum."
