    "intro": "Aloe davyana, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, spine-tipped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are borne on tall, branched stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Aloe davyana is drought-tolerant and is often used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
