    "intro": "Atriplex arenaria subsp. tornabenei, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Atriplex arenaria subsp. tornabenei is well adapted to drought and high salinity, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
