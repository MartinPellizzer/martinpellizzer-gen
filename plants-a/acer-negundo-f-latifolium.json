    "intro": "Acer negundo f. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically larger than those of the typical boxelder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
