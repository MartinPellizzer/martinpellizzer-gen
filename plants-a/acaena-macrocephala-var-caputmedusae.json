    "intro": "Acaena macrocephala var. caputmedusae, commonly known as the \"Medusa's Head\" or \"Cape Spurge,\" is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions.",

It is found in the northern and central regions of the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal areas, rocky outcrops, and disturbed soils. It is commonly associated with the lower and middle regions of the North Island. The variety is well adapted to the temperate climate and maritime conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrocephala var. caputmedusae was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some regions. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It is now considered a weed in certain parts of New Zealand, posing a threat to native ecosystems."
