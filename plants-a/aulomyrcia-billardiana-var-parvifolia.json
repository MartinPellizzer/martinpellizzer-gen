    "intro": "Aulomyrcia billardiana var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved billardiana, is a rare shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
