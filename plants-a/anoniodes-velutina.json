    "intro": "Anoniodes velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
