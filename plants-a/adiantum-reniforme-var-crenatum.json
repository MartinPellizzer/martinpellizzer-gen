    "intro": "Adiantum reniforme var. crenatum, commonly known as the crenate maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It features intricate, finely divided, bright green fronds that are often described as lace-like in appearance. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive crenate or scalloped edge that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
