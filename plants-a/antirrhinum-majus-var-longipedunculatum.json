    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus var. longipedunculatum, commonly known as the long pedunculate snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of brightly colored, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their shape and nectar production. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
