    "intro": "Acacia portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican acacia, is a shrub native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow floral spikes. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal areas and dry forests, often growing in sandy or limestone soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in some conservation programs.",

It is found in coastal areas and dry forests, particularly in the southern and western regions of the island. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the tropical climate of Puerto Rico. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. However, its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare plant in the wild.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia portoricensis was mainly introduced to Puerto Rico. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. This plant has adapted well to the local climate and soil conditions. It is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system. However, it has also been identified as a potential invasive species in some regions."
