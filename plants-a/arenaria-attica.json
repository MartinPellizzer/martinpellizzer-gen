    "intro": "Arenaria attica, commonly known as the Greek sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arenaria attica is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments."
