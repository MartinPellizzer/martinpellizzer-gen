It is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically glabrous or nearly hairless. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne in dense, racemose inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
