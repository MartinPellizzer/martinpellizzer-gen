    "intro": "Agave nayaritensis, commonly known as the Nayarit agave, is a species native to the highlands of the state of Nayarit in western Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a layer of white wax. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with sharp, spiny margins. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping."
