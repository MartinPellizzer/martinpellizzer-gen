    "intro": "Astragalus bulla, commonly known as the bull's head milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed pods that resemble a bull's head, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus bulla has small, pea-like flowers that are usually pale purple or white, and it produces a yellow to brown seed coat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
