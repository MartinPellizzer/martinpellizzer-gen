    "intro": "Agrostis procera, commonly known as tall browntop, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spike that bears small, two-lobed spikelets. Agrostis procera is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and is often found in association with other wetland grasses."
