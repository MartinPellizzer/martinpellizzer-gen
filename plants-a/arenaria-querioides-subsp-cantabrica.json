    "intro": "Arenaria querioides subsp. cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that helps it retain moisture. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of the Eurosiberian and Mediterranean flora."
