    "intro": "Astrocarpa spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed starwort, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to spatulate in shape, giving it its specific epithet \"spathulifolia.\" It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. Astrocarpa spathulifolia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
