This plant is commonly found in moist, lowland areas such as rainforests and riverine habitats. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. The species is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found near human settlements or along forest edges. Its native distribution is closely linked to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana f. concolor was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly used as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the United States. However, its invasive potential varies depending on local environmental conditions and management practices."
