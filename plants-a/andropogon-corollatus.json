    "intro": "Andropogon corollatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 2 to 4 feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flower clusters in late summer. It is a valuable component of native plant communities and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization."
