    "intro": "Amyris trimera, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Amyris trimera is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy flowers and adaptability to various soil types. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
