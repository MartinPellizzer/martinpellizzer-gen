    "intro": "Astragalus prominens, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus prominens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
