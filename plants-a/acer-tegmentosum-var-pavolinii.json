    "intro": "Acer tegmentosum var. pavolinii, commonly known as the Pavolini maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative shrub. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for horticultural collections.",
