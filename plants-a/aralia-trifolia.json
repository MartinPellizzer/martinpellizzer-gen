    "intro": "Aralia trifolia, commonly known as three-leaved aralia, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal remedies. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
