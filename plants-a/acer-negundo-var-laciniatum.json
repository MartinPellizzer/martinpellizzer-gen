    "intro": "Acer negundo var. laciniatum, commonly known as the fragrant maple, is a variant of the box elder tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated, palmate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping, though it is relatively short-lived.",
