    "intro": "Aetanthus, commonly known as the bluebell or wild hyacinth, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. These plants are characterized by their striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. Aetanthus species typically grow in woodland areas and are adapted to moist, well-drained soils. They have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. The genus includes several species, such as Aetanthus sylvaticus, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
