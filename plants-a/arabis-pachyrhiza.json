    "intro": "Arabis pachyrhiza, commonly known as the thick-ribbed rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
