    "intro": "Arthrocereus rondonianus, commonly known as the Rondonian night bloomer, is a cactus native to Brazil. It is a columnar cactus with thick, ribbed stems that store water, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection. The species is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
