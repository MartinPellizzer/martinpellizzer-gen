    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. unilaterale, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for erosion control and pastureland. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and improve soil structure in degraded areas."
