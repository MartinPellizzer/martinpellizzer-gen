    "intro": "Acer tataricum f. crispatum, commonly known as the Siberian maple with crisped leaves, is a variant of the Siberian maple characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated foliage. This shrub or small tree typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and is native to parts of eastern Asia. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a pale yellow or greenish-white underside, adding to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, red or orange-red flowers in spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",
