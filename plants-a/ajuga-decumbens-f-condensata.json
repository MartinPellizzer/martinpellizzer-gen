    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens f. condensata, commonly known as compact ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
