    "intro": "Aspilia fontinalis, commonly known as the water aspilia, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams and ponds. Its yellow-orange flower heads are composed of numerous tiny florets, and it has a short, sturdy stem with narrow, grass-like leaves. Aspilia fontinalis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
