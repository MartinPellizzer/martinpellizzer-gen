    "intro": "Acrostichum septentrionale, commonly known as the northern sword fern, is a perennial fern native to the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to two meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The leaves are evergreen, providing year-round foliage in its natural habitat.",
