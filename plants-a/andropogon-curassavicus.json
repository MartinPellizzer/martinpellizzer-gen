    "intro": "Andropogon curassavicus, commonly known as grass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to rehabilitate degraded wetland areas."
