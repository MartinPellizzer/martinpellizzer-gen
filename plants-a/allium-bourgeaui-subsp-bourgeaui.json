    "intro": "Allium bourgeaui subsp. bourgeaui, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stalk that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a cluster. Its bulbous structure is similar to other allium species, but it has distinct ecological adaptations to its high-altitude habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems."
