    "intro": "Acer creticum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically round or heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer creticum var. rotundifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests, growing on slopes and in shaded understory environments. The species is known for its distinctive broad, rounded leaves and is valued for its ornamental qualities. Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer creticum var. rotundifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically found in woodland or forested regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage. The plant is commonly found in regions of Europe and parts of Asia where it has been intentionally introduced for landscaping purposes. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats that provide the right balance of light and moisture. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced."
