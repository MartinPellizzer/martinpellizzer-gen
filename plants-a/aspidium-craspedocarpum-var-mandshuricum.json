    "intro": "Aspidium craspedocarpum var. mandshuricum, commonly known as the Mandshurian water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant is native to eastern Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Korea, and Russia. Its fronds are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a decorative plant in moist, shaded areas."
