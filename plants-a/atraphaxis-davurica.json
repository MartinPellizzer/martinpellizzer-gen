    "intro": "Atraphaxis davurica, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It has small, narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer, followed by spherical, dry fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can survive in harsh, drought-prone conditions. Its unique morphology and resilience make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
