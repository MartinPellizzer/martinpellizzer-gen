    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic bluegrass, is a variant of the common bluegrass species. It is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic coast, characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. It forms dense, low-growing mats that help stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in coastal habitats."
