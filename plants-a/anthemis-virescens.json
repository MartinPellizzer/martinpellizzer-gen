    "intro": "Anthemis virescens, commonly known as the green everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The green everlasting is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried floral arrangements."
