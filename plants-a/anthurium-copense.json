    "intro": "Anthurium copense, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped spathe that ranges in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green spadix. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect sunlight for optimal growth. Its foliage consists of broad, glossy, dark green leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium copense is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its aesthetic value and relatively easy care requirements."
