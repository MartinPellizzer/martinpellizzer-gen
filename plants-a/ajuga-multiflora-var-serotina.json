    "intro": "Ajuga multiflora var. serotina, commonly known as late-flowering ajuga, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom later in the season compared to other ajuga varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable ground cover for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and prevent erosion."
