    "intro": "Arabis jacquinii, commonly known as the Jacob's beard, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Arabis jacquinii is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
