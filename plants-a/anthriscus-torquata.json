    "intro": "Anthriscus torquata, commonly known as the twisted cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its unique spiral arrangement of leaves gives it a distinctive appearance, and it is often found in mountainous regions. Anthriscus torquata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
