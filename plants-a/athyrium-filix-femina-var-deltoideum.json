    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. deltoideum, commonly known as the Lady Fern, is a variant of the common lady fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, deltoid-shaped fronds. This fern is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance that enhances its ornamental value. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle. It is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
