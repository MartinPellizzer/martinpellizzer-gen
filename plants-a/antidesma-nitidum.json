    "intro": "Antidesma nitidum, commonly known as the glossy antidesma, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glossy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in cyathia, which are typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Antidesma nitidum is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses."
