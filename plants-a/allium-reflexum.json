    "intro": "Allium reflexum, commonly known as the bent garlic or curly leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or reflexed, giving it its common name. The plant produces a slender flowering stem topped with a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are small and are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. Allium reflexum is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine environments."
