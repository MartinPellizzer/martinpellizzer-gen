    "intro": "Arenaria longicaulis, commonly known as the longstem sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically has small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its elongated stems and compact growth habit make it well-suited for rocky or sandy substrates. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
