    "intro": "Aspidium cubense, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as stream banks and forest floors in tropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium cubense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
