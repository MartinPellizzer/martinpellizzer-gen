    "intro": "Agrostis chamissonis, commonly known as the Chamisson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Agrostis chamissonis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
