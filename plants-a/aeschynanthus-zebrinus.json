    "intro": "Aeschynanthus zebrinus, commonly known as the zebra plant, is a flowering shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, zebra-like striping on its leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically red or orange in color, which bloom in clusters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture to maintain its vibrant foliage. Aeschynanthus zebrinus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
