    "intro": "Aureolaria pectinata subsp. floridana, commonly known as the Florida sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
