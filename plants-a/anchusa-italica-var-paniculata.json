It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its hardiness and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
