    "intro": "Aconitum geraniifolium, commonly known as the garden aconite or the false hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of geranium, hence its common name. Aconitum geraniifolium is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.",
