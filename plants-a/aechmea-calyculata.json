    "intro": "Aechmea calyculata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, velvety coating, giving it its common name. Aechmea calyculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
