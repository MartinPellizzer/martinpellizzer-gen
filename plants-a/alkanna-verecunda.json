    "intro": "Alkanna verecunda, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces a unique resinous substance that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a dye. Alkanna verecunda thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for certain desert wildlife."
