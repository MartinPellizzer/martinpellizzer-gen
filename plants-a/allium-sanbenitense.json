    "intro": "Allium sanbenitense, commonly known as the San Benito onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic and onions, though they are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
