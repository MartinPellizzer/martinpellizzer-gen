    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. connivens, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of basal leaves that are softly hairy and have a distinctive scalloped margin. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters atop leafless stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and wetland restoration projects."
