It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and fluffy, blue-pink flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodland or swampy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy margins, and the varietal name \"filifolia\" refers to the thread-like appearance of its foliage.
