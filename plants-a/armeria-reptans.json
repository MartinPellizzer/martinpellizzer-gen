    "intro": "Armeria reptans, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
