    "intro": "Alangium kurzii var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered alangium, is a deciduous shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Berberidaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
