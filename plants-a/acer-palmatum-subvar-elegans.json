    "intro": "Acer palmatum subvar. elegans, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a striking ornamental tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like foliage that displays vibrant shades of green, red, and orange throughout the growing season. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 10 feet, with a rounded, compact form that makes it suitable for small gardens or as a specimen plant. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with finely serrated edges, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The tree thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil.",
