    "intro": "Acalypha cuprea, commonly known as copperleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking reddish-orange foliage. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. Acalypha cuprea is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant leaf color and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cuprea is primarily native to Bolivia. It is commonly found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Beni, Santa Cruz, and Tarija. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas within the rainforest. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the humid climate of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Bolivia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cuprea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions across the country. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and riverbanks. Although it is not considered highly invasive, it has the potential to spread and compete with native vegetation if left unchecked. Conservation efforts focus on monitoring its distribution and preventing further spread to protect local ecosystems."
