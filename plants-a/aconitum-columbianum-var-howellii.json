    "intro": "Aconitum columbianum var. howellii, commonly known as Howell's monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in tall, upright spikes. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and a distinctive purple underside. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, often found in forested areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
