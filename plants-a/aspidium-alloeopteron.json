    "intro": "Aspidium alloeopteron, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sorus. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium alloeopteron is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
