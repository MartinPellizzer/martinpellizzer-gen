    "intro": "Astragalus subarcuatus, commonly known as the bentstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus subarcuatus plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a food source for various herbivores."
