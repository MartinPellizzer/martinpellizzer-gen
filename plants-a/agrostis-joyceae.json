    "intro": "Agrostis joyceae, commonly known as Joyce's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in shaded woodland areas. The plant has slender, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Agrostis joyceae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover in garden settings."
