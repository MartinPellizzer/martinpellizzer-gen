    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia intsia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland and coastal areas. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in secondary forests or along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia intsia is also valued for its timber and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia intsia was mainly introduced to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It was brought there for its valuable timber, which is highly prized for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has also been introduced to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands for similar reasons. Due to its fast growth and adaptability, it has become naturalized in many of these regions. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas."
