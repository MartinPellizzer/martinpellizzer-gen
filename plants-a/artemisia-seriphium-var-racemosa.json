    "intro": "Artemisia seriphium var. racemosa, commonly known as the clustered wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, branching clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, bitter scent and making it a member of the Asteraceae family. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural insect repellents."
