    "intro": "Artocarpus lakoocha, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. The plant produces large, round fruits that are typically harvested when mature, though they can be consumed at different stages of ripeness. Its leaves are palmately compound, with long, slender leaflets, and the tree has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, tropical soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental value and is often planted for shade in tropical landscapes."
