    "intro": "Aspidium halleri, commonly known as the Haller's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Aspidium halleri thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
