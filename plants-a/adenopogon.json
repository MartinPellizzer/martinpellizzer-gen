    "intro": "Adenopogon, commonly known as the grass vetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are usually yellow or purple in color. Adenopogon species are often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and fields. The genus is characterized by its unique floral structure and its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia."
