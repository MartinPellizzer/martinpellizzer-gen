    "intro": "Anarrhinum forskaohlii subsp. abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian sand thorn, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
