    "intro": "Antennaria tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly willow or snowplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Antennaria tomentosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
