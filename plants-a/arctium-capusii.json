    "intro": "Arctium capusii, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like structure that forms around its flowers, aiding in seed dispersal. Arctium capusii is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
