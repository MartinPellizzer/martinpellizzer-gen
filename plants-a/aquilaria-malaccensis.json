    "intro": "Aquilaria malaccensis, commonly known as the agarwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Thymelaeaceae and is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall and has opposite, simple, and often leathery leaves. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. The unique scent of agarwood is due to the resinous compounds secreted in response to fungal infections or injuries."
