    "intro": "Abutilon trisulcatum, commonly known as the three-ridged abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its flowers are usually yellow or orange, arranged in clusters. It produces small, three-lobed fruits that contain numerous seeds. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these areas. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its hairy leaves and showy flowers, which contribute to its ecological significance. Its native range reflects its adaptability to different climatic conditions within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon trisulcatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers. It was likely brought there by early settlers or horticulturalists who valued its aesthetic appeal. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native species in island environments."
