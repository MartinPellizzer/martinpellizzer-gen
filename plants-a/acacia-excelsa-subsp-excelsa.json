    "intro": "Acacia excelsa subsp. excelsa, commonly known as the tall golden wattle, is a striking tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of numerous narrow, linear leaflets. It produces woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and ecologically important plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa subsp. excelsa is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in the eastern parts of Australia, particularly in regions with a subtropical to tropical climate. This subspecies thrives in open woodlands, heathlands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the diverse environmental conditions of these regions. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern coastal areas of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa subsp. excelsa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the eastern and western parts of the country, particularly in the coastal areas and along rivers. This species is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and urban environments. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond its native range, contributing to local vegetation dynamics. However, it is not considered an invasive species in most areas where it is established."
