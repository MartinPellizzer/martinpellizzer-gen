    "intro": "Agropyron tetrastachys, commonly known as the four-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it its specific epithet \"tetrastachys.\" Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agropyron tetrastachys is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
