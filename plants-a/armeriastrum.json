    "intro": "Armeriastrum, commonly known as sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cariophyllaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, well-drained soils. They are characterized by their succulent leaves and showy, often blue or purple, flowers that bloom in summer. Armeriastrum species are often used in rock gardens and coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes around 30 species, many of which are native to the Mediterranean region and coastal parts of North America."
