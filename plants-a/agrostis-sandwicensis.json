    "intro": "Agrostis sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Hawaii."
