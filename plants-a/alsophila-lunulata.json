    "intro": "Alsophila lunulata, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, recurved shape with a smooth, grayish-brown stem covered in a thin layer of sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
