    "intro": "Alternanthera aquatica, commonly known as water thyme, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has small, narrow leaves that are typically bright red or pink, though they can vary in color depending on light conditions. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or white. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a useful water purifier and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
