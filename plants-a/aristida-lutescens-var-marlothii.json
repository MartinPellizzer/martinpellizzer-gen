It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble a beard. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
