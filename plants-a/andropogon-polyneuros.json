It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle.

This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
