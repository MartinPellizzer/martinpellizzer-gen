    "intro": "Argyreia gyrobracteata, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture."
