    "intro": "Allomaieta caucana, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps to reduce water loss in its high-altitude environment. Allomaieta caucana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
