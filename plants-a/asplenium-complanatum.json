    "intro": "Asplenium complanatum, commonly known as the broad fern or flat fern, is a species of polypod fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows as a small, terrestrial or epiphytic plant, with fronds that are broad and often creeping along the ground. The leaves are usually dark green, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often have a distinctive, flat appearance. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium complanatum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas."
