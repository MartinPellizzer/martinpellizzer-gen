    "intro": "Attalea regia, commonly known as the royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits resembling small dates. Its leaves are used in traditional crafts, and its fruit is a source of nutrition for both humans and wildlife. The royal palm is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in tropical landscapes."
