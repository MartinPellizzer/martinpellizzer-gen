    "intro": "Acer italum f. cordisectum, commonly known as the split-leaf maple, is a variant of the Italian maple characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that give it a unique, almost fern-like appearance. This ornamental tree is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a popular choice for landscaping. The plant is relatively slow-growing and can reach heights of up to 20 feet, with a rounded or irregular crown. It is also known for its ability to tolerate partial shade, making it adaptable to a variety of garden settings.",
