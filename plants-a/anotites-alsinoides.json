It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects. Anotites alsinoides plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing food for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
