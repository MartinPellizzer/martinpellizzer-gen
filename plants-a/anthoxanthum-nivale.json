    "intro": "Anthoxanthum nivale, commonly known as snowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, tufted foliage that remains snow-covered for much of the year. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to white florets, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Anthoxanthum nivale plays a crucial role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
