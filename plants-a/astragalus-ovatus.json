It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmate leaves with 5 to 7 leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Astragalus ovatus is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
