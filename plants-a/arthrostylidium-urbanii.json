    "intro": "Arthrostylidium urbanii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat its fleshy, red berries. The plant's ability to photosynthesize partially allows it to survive in shaded environments while still relying on its host for water and nutrients."
