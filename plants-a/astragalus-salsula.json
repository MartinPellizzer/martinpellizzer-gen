    "intro": "Astragalus salsula, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry conditions. Astragalus salsula is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
