    "intro": "Aloe nitida, commonly known as the silver aloe or tree aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a tall, tree-like structure with a thick, fleshy stem and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a white, powdery coating. The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern and have a waxy texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Aloe nitida is well-suited for xeriscaping and can thrive in full sun with minimal water."
