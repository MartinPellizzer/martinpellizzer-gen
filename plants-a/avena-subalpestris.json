    "intro": "Avena subalpestris, commonly known as the alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Avena subalpestris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in alpine ecosystems."
