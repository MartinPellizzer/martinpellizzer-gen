    "intro": "Astragalus xerophiloides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are typically slender and contain several small, hard seeds. Astragalus xerophiloides is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems."
