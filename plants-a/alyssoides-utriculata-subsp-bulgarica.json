    "intro": "Alyssoides utriculata subsp. bulgarica, commonly known as the Bulgarian bladder-leaf, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and distinctive bladder-like structures on its stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
