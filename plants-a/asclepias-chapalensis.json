    "intro": "Asclepias chapalensis, commonly known as the Chapalensis milkweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by follicles containing toxic, milky sap. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation efforts."
