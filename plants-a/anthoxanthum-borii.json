It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces pale yellow to brownish florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Anthoxanthum borii is adapted to cold climates and is a common component of high-altitude vegetation."
