    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow false wheat, is a wild annual grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement programs."
