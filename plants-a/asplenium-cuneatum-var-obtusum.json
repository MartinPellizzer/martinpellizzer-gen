    "intro": "Asplenium cuneatum var. obtusum, commonly known as the blunt-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with closely spaced, small pinnae that give the plant a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
