    "intro": "Asplenium prionites, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It is often found growing on stone surfaces, especially in moist, temperate regions. Asplenium prionites is a low-maintenance plant that is well adapted to its specialized habitat."
