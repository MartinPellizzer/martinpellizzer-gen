    "intro": "Aspidium exile, commonly known as the slender water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium exile is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful appearance."
