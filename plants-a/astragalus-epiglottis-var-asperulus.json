    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottis var. asperulus, commonly known as the rough epiglottis milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
