    "intro": "Asclepias pseudoamabilis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Asclepias pseudoamabilis is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting both the butterfly population and local ecosystems."
