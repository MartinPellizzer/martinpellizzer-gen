    "intro": "Acacia benthamii, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and feathery leaves, which are typical of the Acacia genus. The plant thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to salty air and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia benthamii is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Shark Bay regions. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. It is commonly found in coastal and inland dune systems. Acacia benthamii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia benthamii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall. It thrives in environments where it can receive full sun exposure and has good drainage, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil. It has been introduced to parts of Australia, the United States, and other regions with similar climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
