    "intro": "Aloe pumila var. margaritifera, commonly known as the \"pearl aloe,\" is a small, succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor settings."
