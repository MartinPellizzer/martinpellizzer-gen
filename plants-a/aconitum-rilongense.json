    "intro": "Aconitum rilongense, commonly known as the Rilong monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy and have a waxy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
