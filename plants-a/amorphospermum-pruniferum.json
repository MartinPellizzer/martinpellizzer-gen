    "intro": "Amorphospermum pruniferum, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause irritation. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with smooth, greyish bark and oval-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its fruit is a three-lobed capsule containing numerous seeds. The plant is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
