    "intro": "Artemisia wulfenii, commonly known as silverleaf artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in flat-topped arrays, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia wulfenii is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and ability to attract beneficial insects make it a valuable plant in ecological and ornamental landscapes."
