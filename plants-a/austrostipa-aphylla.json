    "intro": "Austrostipa aphylla, commonly known as the hairless wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils or in open habitats. Austrostipa aphylla is an important component of local ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various wildlife species."
