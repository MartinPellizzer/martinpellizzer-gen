    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 shawneense, commonly known as the Shawnee spleenwort, is a hybrid fern that belongs to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Asplenium \u00d7 shawneense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
