    "intro": "Abies medioxima, commonly known as the Mexican fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones that hang downward. The tree thrives in temperate climates with high elevation and well-drained soils. Its bark is typically reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age. Abies medioxima plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies medioxima is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China, Korea, and Japan. It is commonly found in the temperate forests of these areas, growing at high altitudes. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies medioxima was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive conical shape and evergreen foliage. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscaped areas across the United States and Canada. Despite its aesthetic value, it has shown limited naturalization and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems. Its introduction has primarily occurred through horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal. However, it is not considered invasive in its introduced range."
