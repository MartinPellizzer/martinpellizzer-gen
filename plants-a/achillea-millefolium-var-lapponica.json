    "intro": "Achillea millefolium var. lapponica, commonly known as the Lapland yarrow, is a perennial herb native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in alpine or tundra environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine. The variety is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to the typical A. millefolium.",
