    "intro": "Arenaria macrocarpa var. jooi, commonly known as the Jooi sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety is distinguished by its larger seed pods compared to other Arenaria species."
