    "intro": "Arundarbor remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flower orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, pale lavender flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence. The plant's leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a conservation concern."
