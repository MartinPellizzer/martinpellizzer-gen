    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida subsp. lapeyrousii, commonly known as the Lapeyroussie alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stalks. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. This species is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
