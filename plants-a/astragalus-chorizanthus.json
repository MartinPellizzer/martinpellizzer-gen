    "intro": "Astragalus chorizanthus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus chorizanthus plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides forage for wildlife, though it is not commonly cultivated."
