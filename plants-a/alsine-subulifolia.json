    "intro": "Alsine subulifolia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Alsine subulifolia is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
