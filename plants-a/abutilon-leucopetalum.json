    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon leucopetalum is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the dry climate of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon leucopetalum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The species has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems."
