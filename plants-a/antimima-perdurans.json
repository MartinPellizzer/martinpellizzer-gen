    "intro": "Antimima perdurans, commonly known as the everlasting antimima, is a rare and resilient plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, fibrous stems. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow and white. Antimima perdurans is known for its ability to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments due to its deep root system and waxy leaf coating. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
