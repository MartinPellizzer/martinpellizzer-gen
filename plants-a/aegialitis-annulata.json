    "intro": "Aegialitis annulata, commonly known as the mangrove button, is a tropical plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in brackish or saltwater environments, such as mangrove forests. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, yellowish flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, which are dispersed by water. Aegialitis annulata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
