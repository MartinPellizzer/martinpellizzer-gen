    "intro": "Antirrhinum nuttallianum subsp. subsessile, commonly known as the narrowleaf snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are typically red or orange, with two lips that resemble a dragon's mouth, giving it its common name. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
