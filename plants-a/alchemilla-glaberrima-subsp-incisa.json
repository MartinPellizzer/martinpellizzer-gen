It features basal rosettes of gray-green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
