    "intro": "Acrostichum caenopteris var. salicifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a variant of the common bracken. It is a fern species characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The leaves are typically broad and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.",
