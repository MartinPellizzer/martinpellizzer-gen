    "intro": "Asplenium ambiguum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that often exhibit a zigzag pattern, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Asplenium ambiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
