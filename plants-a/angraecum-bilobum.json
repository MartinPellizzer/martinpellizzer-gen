    "intro": "Angraecum bilobum, commonly known as the two-lobed orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear numerous white or pale pink flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific moths, showcasing a fascinating example of co-evolution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum bilobum is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
