    "intro": "Acanthocalycium rhodotrichum subsp. chacoanum, commonly known as the Chacoan prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Argentina and Paraguay. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense clusters of spines. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by edible, red-fleshed fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting well to poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its role in local ecosystems.",

This species is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the Chaco region. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the dry climate of its native habitat. The plant is often found in open grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Paraguay.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium rhodotrichum subsp. chacoanum was mainly introduced to the regions of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid environments, particularly in sandy soils. This subspecies is known for its compact growth and spiny stems, making it a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts. It thrives in full sun and requires minimal water, which contributes to its adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora in these regions."
