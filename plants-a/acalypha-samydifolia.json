    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha samydifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of the Indian subcontinent, including India and Sri Lanka. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha samydifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and high humidity, such as parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for gardens and landscaped areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
