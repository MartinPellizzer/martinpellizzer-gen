    "intro": "Agrostis muscosa, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
