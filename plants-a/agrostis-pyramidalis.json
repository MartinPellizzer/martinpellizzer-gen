    "intro": "Agrostis pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spikelet that is often pyramidal in shape, giving the plant its common name. Agrostis pyramidalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
