    "intro": "Amyris acuminata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandarac tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces a resinous sap, which has been historically used in the manufacture of varnishes and perfumes. Amyris acuminata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
