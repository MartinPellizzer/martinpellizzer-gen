It is a tall, slender palm with a single trunk and pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy fruits that are edible. It thrives in wetland and swampy environments, often forming dense stands in its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
