    "intro": "Alnus incana f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to arctic and alpine regions. It is a small shrub or tree with dark green, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in catkins, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it often grows in dense clusters on rocky or barren ground. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological succession."
