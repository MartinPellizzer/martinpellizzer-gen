    "intro": "Arenaria costata, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant has small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and succulent. It is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Arenaria costata plays an important role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion."
