    "intro": "Androsace albana var. typica, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of rosettes with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its delicate structure, it is adapted to cold climates and is a characteristic species of high-altitude vegetation."
