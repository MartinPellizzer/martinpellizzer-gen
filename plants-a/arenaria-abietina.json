    "intro": "Arenaria abietina, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, helping it conserve moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria abietina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous and high-altitude habitats."
