    "intro": "Asplenium microxiphion, commonly known as the narrow-sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium microxiphion is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
