    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus var. altaicus, commonly known as the high mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and sharply pointed, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
