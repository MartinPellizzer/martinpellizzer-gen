    "intro": "Aristida dichotoma, commonly known as the two-branched grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and the presence of two branches at each node, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Aristida dichotoma is often found in disturbed soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
