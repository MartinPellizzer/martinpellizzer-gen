    "intro": "Astragalus lectulus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are compound, with multiple narrow leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus lectulus is valued for its role in ecological systems and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
