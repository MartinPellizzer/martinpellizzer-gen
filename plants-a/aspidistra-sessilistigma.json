    "intro": "Aspidistra sessilistigma, commonly known as the sessile-stigma aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the forests of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aspidistra sessilistigma is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
