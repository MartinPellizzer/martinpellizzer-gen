    "intro": "Asplenium serratum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated or toothed along the edges. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Asplenium serratum is a low-growing plant, usually reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters, and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
