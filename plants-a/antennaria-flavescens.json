    "intro": "Antennaria flavescens, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Its yellowish flowers bloom in early spring, and the leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Antennaria flavescens is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
