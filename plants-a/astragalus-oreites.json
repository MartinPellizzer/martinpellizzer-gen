    "intro": "Astragalus oreites, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water and nutrients in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus oreites is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
