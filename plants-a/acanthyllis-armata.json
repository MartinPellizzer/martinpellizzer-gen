    "intro": "Acanthyllis armata, commonly known as the woolly thornweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its flowering period usually occurs during the summer months, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Acanthyllis armata is also known for its spiny stems, which provide some protection against herbivory.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthyllis armata is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This plant is particularly adapted to dry and sunny environments, often growing in limestone or sandy substrates. Its distribution includes countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and southern France. It is a member of the legume family and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthyllis armata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an invasive species that has spread across various regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental seed dispersal via human activities. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
