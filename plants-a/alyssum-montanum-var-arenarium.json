    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. arenarium, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. It is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
