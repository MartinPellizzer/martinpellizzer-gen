    "intro": "Abronia umbellata var. alba, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and drought tolerance in xeriscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata var. alba is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and parts of Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and sandy soil habitats. This variety thrives in areas with mild, moist climates and is often associated with coastal dunes. It is particularly common in the northern coastal regions of California. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species in some areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata var. alba was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America. It thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats with full sun exposure. This plant is often found in areas with minimal vegetation cover and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including coastal development and gardening. However, it is considered non-native and can sometimes compete with native plant species in its new environment."
