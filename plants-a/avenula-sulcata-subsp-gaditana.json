    "intro": "Avenula sulcata subsp. gaditana, commonly known as the Iberian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often reddish stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range."
