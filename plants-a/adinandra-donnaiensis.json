    "intro": "Adinandra donnaiensis, commonly known as the Malabar ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
