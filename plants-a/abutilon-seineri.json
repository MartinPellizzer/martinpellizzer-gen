It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil, often growing as an understorey plant. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of habitats within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon seineri was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in disturbed soils and sunny environments. The plant is known for its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature. However, it is also considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
