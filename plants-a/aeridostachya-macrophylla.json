    "intro": "Aeridostachya macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic life. The plant produces showy, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. This species plays an important role in water filtration and provides shelter for fish and invertebrates."
