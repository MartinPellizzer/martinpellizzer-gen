    "intro": "Allium mardinense, commonly known as Mardin garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in suitable climates. Due to its unique appearance and culinary potential, it is of interest to both botanists and gardeners."
