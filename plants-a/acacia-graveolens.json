    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia graveolens is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, often found in savannas and rocky outcrops. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can tolerate poor soil conditions. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia graveolens is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny stems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia graveolens was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant is also used in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize degraded lands. However, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a useful but potentially problematic species."
