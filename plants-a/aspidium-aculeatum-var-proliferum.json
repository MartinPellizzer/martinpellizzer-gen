    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. proliferum, commonly known as the spreading wood fern, is a variant of the common wood fern native to temperate regions. It is a perennial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth and fronds that are typically bipinnate or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, contributing to its prevalence in suitable habitats."
