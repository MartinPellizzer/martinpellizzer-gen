    "intro": "Aphelandra runcinata, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its large, paddle-shaped leaves with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces long, pendant inflorescences bearing bright yellow bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. Its foliage and vibrant display make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. Aphelandra runcinata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
