    "intro": "Antennaria muscoides, commonly known as the mossy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, green to reddish-brown leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers in clusters. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Antennaria muscoides plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
