    "intro": "Acacia muriculata, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in spherical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Acacia muriculata thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to provide habitat and food for local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia muriculata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dunes. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat. Acacia muriculata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia muriculata was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and along riverbanks. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen contribute to its success in invasive spread. However, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a potential weed in some areas."
