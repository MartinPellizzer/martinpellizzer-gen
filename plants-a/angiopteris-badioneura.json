    "intro": "Angiopteris badioneura, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a finely divided structure, which aids in photosynthesis in water. Angiopteris badioneura is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams."
