    "intro": "Acrocomia minor, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, slow-growing palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically reaches a height of about 2 to 3 meters, with a slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that develop into clustered, edible fruits resembling chestnuts. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant. Acrocomia minor is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions.",
