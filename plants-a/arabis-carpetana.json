    "intro": "Arabis carpetana, commonly known as the carpeted rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically forms dense mats of dark green foliage with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Arabis carpetana thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
