    "intro": "Andromeda lycopodioides, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant belonging to the family Viscaraceae. It primarily infests coniferous trees such as fir and spruce, relying on them for nutrients and water. The plant produces small, fleshy, berry-like structures that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Its roots form specialized structures called haustoria that penetrate the host's vascular system. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and providing food for certain wildlife species."
