    "intro": "Androsace orbicularis, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in a raceme. Its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Androsace orbicularis is well adapted to poor soils and extreme weather conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience."
