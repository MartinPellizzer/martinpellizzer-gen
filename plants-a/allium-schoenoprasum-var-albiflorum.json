It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its mild garlic-like flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and herb beds. The white flowers not only add aesthetic value but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
