    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 pichisermollianum, commonly known as the hybrid lady fern, is a fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filipendulineum and Athyrium pichisermollianum. It exhibits a combination of traits from both parent species, including delicate fronds with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing fronds are usually produced in late summer, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
