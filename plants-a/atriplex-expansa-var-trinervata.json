    "intro": "Atriplex expansa var. trinervata, commonly known as the three-veined saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves with three distinct veins, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Atriplex expansa var. trinervata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
