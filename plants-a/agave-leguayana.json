    "intro": "Agave leguayana, commonly known as the Mexican hat agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave leguayana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional Mexican crafts."
