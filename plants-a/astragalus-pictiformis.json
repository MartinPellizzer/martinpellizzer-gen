    "intro": "Astragalus pictiformis, commonly known as the painted milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful flowers that range from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus pictiformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators in its native range."
