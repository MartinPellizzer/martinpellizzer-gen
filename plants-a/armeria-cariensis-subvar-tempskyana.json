    "intro": "Armeria cariensis subvar. tempskyana, commonly known as the Templeton's thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of beaches, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
