    "intro": "Adiantum villosum var. falcatum, commonly known as the running maidenhair fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, arching fronds with a distinctive, narrow, sickle-shaped appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing clusters called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Its lush, feathery foliage makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening.",
