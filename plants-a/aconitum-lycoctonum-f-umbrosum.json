    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum f. umbrosum, commonly known as the shade-loving aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, tall spires. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
