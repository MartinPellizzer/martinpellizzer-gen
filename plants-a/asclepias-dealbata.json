    "intro": "Asclepias dealbata, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its milkweed sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias dealbata is also an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
