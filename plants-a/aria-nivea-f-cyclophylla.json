    "intro": "Aria nivea f. cyclophylla, commonly known as the white-flowered aria, is a rare and unique botanical variant of the species Aria nivea. It is characterized by its distinctive white, often clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean. Its foliage is narrow and linear, with a silvery-blue hue that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
