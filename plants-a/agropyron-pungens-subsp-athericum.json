    "intro": "Agropyron pungens subsp. athericum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
