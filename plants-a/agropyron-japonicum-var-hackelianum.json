It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with a fine layer of hair, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils."
