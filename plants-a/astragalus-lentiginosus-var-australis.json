    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
