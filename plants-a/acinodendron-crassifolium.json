It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its dense, thick, and leathery leaves, which are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and less commonly studied species.",
