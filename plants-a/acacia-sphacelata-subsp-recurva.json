    "intro": "Acacia sphacelata subsp. recurva, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

This subspecies is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas of the Geraldton and Esperance regions. It typically grows in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas. The plant is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sphacelata subsp. recurva was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. This subspecies is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation. It is also valued for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments."
