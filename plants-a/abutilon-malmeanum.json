    "intro": "Abutilon malmeanum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in clusters. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it adaptable to various soil types, though it thrives in well-drained, moist conditions. Abutilon malmeanum is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon malmeanum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in lowland areas, including forests and along riverbanks. It is often associated with secondary growth habitats and can be seen in disturbed or semi-natural environments. Its distribution is also extended to parts of Central America, where it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon malmeanum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking to cultivate exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
