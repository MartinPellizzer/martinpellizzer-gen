    "intro": "Aconitum rhombifolium var. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-capsuled monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers, which are typically arranged in a raceme atop a tall stem. The plant has palmately divided, rhombic-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine pubescence. Its roots contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant to be handled with care. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.",
