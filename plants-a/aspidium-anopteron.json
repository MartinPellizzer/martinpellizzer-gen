    "intro": "Aspidium anopteron, commonly known as the narrow-veined water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. Aspidium anopteron plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
