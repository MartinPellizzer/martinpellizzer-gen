    "intro": "Apurimacia michelii f. breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered apurimacia, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
