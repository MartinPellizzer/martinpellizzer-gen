    "intro": "Antidesma gracile, commonly known as the slender antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are often red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
