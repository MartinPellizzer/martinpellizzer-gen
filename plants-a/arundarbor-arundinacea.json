    "intro": "Arundarbor arundinacea, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in wet or moist environments such as marshes, stream banks, and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both an ecologically important species and a potential invasive plant in some areas."
