    "intro": "Arachniodes exilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to substrates, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Arachniodes exilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
