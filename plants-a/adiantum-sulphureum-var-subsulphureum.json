    "intro": "Adiantum sulphureum var. subsulphureum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that display a striking golden hue, especially in the young leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Its fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, arching leaves that give it a graceful appearance. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens.",
