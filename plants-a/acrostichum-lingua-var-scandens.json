It is characterized by its long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires indirect sunlight to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to climb or spread along surfaces, often forming dense mats. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to humid environments.",
