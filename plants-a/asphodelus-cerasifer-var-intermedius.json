    "intro": "Asphodelus cerasifer var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate cherry asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant features strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of pale pink or white flowers in the spring. Its botanical name reflects its intermediate characteristics between the typical cherry asphodel and other related species. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
