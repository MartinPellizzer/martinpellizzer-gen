    "intro": "Agathosma hirsuta, commonly known as the sticky bush or African tea, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky resin, which gives the plant its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers and small, leathery berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its unique chemical composition, it is used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
