    "intro": "Andropogon dichroanthus, commonly known as the two-colored grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned inflorescence, which features both green and purple bracts. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. This species plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
