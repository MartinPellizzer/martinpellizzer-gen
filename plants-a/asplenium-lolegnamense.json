    "intro": "Asplenium lolegnamense, commonly known as the Lolegnamense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in the Andean cloud forests. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating its dispersal through spores."
