    "intro": "Acacia excelsa var. typica, commonly known as the tall golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which bloom in spring.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa var. typica is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This variant is commonly found in lowland and hill forest areas, where it thrives in humid and warm climates. It is often associated with secondary growth forests and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. The plant is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate partial shade. Its distribution is largely confined to the region due to specific environmental requirements and limited dispersal mechanisms.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia excelsa var. typica was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has helped restore ecological balance in areas affected by deforestation. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
