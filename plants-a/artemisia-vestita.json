    "intro": "Artemisia vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia vestita is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples."
