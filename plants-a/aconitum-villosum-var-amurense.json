    "intro": "Aconitum villosum var. amurense, commonly known as the Amur garden aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features showy, blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a velvety texture, and its stems are covered in soft, hairy glands. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
