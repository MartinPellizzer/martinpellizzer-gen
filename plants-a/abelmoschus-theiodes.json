It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in open fields and along riverbanks. This plant is also present in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced for its ornamental and medicinal uses. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and as a decorative plant due to its vibrant flowers. Its natural range reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus theiodes was mainly introduced to control weed competition in agricultural fields. It is commonly used as a cover crop to suppress weeds and improve soil structure. This plant is native to Africa but has been introduced to various regions for its ecological and agricultural benefits. It thrives in warm climates and is often planted in rotation with other crops. Its introduction has helped reduce the need for chemical herbicides in some farming systems."
