    "intro": "Anthyllis rusticana, commonly known as the rough anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Anthyllis rusticana is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for certain pollinators."
