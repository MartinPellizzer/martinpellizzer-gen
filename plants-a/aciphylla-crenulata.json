    "intro": "Aciphylla crenulata, commonly known as the silver tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. The plant features silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Aciphylla crenulata is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils.",
