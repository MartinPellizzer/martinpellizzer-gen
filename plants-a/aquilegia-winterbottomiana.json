It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed. Its flowers come in shades of blue, purple, and white, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade.
