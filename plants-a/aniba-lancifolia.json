    "intro": "Aniba lancifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions, though it can become invasive in some areas. The plant's aromatic foliage and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native habitat."
