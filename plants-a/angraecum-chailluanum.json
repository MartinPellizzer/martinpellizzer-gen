    "intro": "Angraecum chailluanum, commonly known as the Chailluana orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched inflorescence bearing numerous fragrant, white to pale blue flowers. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves and produces pendulous, showy blooms that attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
