    "intro": "Acalypha hellwigii var. glabra, commonly known as smooth false spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth, glabrous surface. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers that are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it may spread aggressively.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hellwigii var. glabra is primarily native to the southern United States, including Texas, Louisiana, and Florida. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This variety thrives in humid climates with abundant moisture. It is often associated with coastal and riverine environments. Its native range extends into parts of Central America as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hellwigii var. glabra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction occurred in the late 19th or early 20th century. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
