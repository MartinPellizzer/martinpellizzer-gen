It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soil. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small blue to purple flowers in the fall. Aster tenuifolius is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
