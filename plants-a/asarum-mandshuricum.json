    "intro": "Asarum mandshuricum, commonly known as Siberian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the forests of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers.

It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its medicinal properties in some Asian cultures. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
