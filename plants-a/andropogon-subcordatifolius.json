    "intro": "Andropogon subcordatifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, forming dense clumps with tall, slender stems. The leaves are narrow and slightly curved, with a blue-green color that becomes more pronounced in the summer. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, releasing light blue to purple flowers. This plant is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
