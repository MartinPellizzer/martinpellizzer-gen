    "intro": "Amauropelta paleacea, commonly known as the paleaceae fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
