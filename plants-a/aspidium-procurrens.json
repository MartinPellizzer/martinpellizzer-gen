    "intro": "Aspidium procurrens, commonly known as the creeping wood fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, lanceolate pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium."
