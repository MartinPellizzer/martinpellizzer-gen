    "intro": "Amaranthus prostratus, commonly known as prostrate amaranth, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Americas. It features spreading, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Amaranthus prostratus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
