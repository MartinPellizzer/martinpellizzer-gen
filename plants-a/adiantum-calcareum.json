    "intro": "Adiantum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It thrives in calcareous soils and shaded, moist environments, often found in rocky or woodland areas. The plant features finely divided, bright green fronds with a distinctive, graceful appearance. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Adiantum calcareum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions.",
