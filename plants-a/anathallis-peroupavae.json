    "intro": "Anathallis peroupavae, commonly known as the Peroupavae spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin sepals and petals. The plant typically grows on tree branches or rocks, exhibiting epiphytic growth habits. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season, and its pollination is primarily carried out by specific species of flies. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
