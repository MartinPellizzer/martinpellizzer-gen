    "intro": "Alsophila crassa, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a tall, tree-like fern characterized by its robust trunk and large, feathery fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. Its trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that helps it retain moisture. Alsophila crassa plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
