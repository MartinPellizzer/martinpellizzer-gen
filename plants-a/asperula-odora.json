    "intro": "Asperula odora, commonly known as sweet tea or woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, releasing a sweet, tea-like aroma. The plant is typically found in woodland areas and thrives in partial shade with well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Asperula odora is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in perfumery and herbal medicine."
