    "intro": "Asplenium terorense, commonly known as the Terrorench fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium terorense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
