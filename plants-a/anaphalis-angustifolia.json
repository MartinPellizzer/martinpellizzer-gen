    "intro": "Anaphalis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved goatweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in a spherical inflorescence, which attracts various pollinators."
