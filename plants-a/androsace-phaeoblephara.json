    "intro": "Androsace phaeoblephara, commonly known as the purple-eyed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers have prominent purple eyespots, which are thought to mimic prey to deter herbivores. Androsace phaeoblephara is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
