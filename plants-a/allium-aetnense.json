    "intro": "Allium aetnense, commonly known as the Etna garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are typically small and have a mild garlic scent. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique ecological niche, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
