It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are often shrubs or small trees with rough, bark-like stems and palmately lobed leaves. Atelandra species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
