    "intro": "Andrographis macrobotrys, commonly known as the large-leaf bittergrass, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is known for its distinctive bitter taste, which is attributed to the presence of andrographolide, a bioactive compound. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Due to its medicinal properties, it is widely used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
