    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris var. angustisecta, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, fern-like leaves that are deeply divided into narrow segments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded woodlands. Due to its resemblance to more toxic species, it can be mistaken for harmful plants, requiring careful identification."
