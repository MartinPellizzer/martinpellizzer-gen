    "intro": "Aconitum venatorium var. ecalcaratum, commonly known as the Alpine Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, downy layer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often grown in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
