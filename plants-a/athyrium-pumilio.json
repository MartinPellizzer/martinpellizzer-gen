    "intro": "Athyrium pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features a compact rosette of fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing clusters, or sori, on the underside of its fronds, typical of the fern family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
