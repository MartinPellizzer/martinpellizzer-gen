    "intro": "Aloe immaculata, commonly known as the white aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces striking, tall flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for both ornamental and medicinal purposes."
