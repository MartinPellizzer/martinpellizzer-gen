    "intro": "Acantholimon narynense, commonly known as the Naryn stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, fleshy leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Tien Shan and Pamir-Alay mountain ranges. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. It is commonly found in areas with cold climates and limited vegetation cover. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon narynense was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in Central Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in steppe and rocky habitats. This plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low precipitation. Its introduction has been noted in regions such as Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan mountains. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in these environments."
