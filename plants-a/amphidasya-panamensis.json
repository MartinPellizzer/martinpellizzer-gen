    "intro": "Amphidasya panamensis, commonly known as the Panama orchid, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
