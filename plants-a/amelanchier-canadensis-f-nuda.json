    "intro": "Amelanchier canadensis f. nuda, commonly known as the smooth serviceberry, is a shrub or small tree native to North America. It features oval to elliptical leaves that are typically smooth on both sides, giving it its \"nuda\" designation, meaning \"naked\" in Latin. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
