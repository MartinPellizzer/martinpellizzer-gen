    "intro": "Aulax, commonly known as the false holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species that are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees with opposite, simple leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. Aulax species produce small, often brightly colored flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
