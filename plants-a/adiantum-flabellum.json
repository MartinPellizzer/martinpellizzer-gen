It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Adiantum flabellum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",
