    "intro": "Aspalathus ascendens, commonly known as the sweet tea plant, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Aspalathus ascendens is particularly noted for its use in the production of green and black tea, which are valued for their unique flavor and health benefits."
