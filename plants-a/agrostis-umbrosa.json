    "intro": "Agrostis umbrosa, commonly known as the shade grass or dark grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Agrostis umbrosa is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small invertebrates."
