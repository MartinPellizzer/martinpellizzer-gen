    "intro": "Adenilema, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Adenilema species are typically low-growing and thrive in humid, well-drained soils. They are popular as houseplants due to their attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as *Adenilema micranthum* and *Adenilema pachyphylla*, which are prized for their ornamental value."
