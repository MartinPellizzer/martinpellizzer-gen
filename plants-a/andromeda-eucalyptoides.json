    "intro": "Andromeda eucalyptoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed candlebush, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its bark is smooth and peels in thin, papery layers, resembling that of eucalyptus trees. It is adapted to acidic, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and pine flatwoods."
