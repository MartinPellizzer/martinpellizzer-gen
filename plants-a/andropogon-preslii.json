    "intro": "Andropogon preslii, commonly known as Preslii bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and pond edges. The plant features narrow, blue-green blades and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Botanically, it is characterized by its fine texture, adaptability to wet conditions, and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems."
