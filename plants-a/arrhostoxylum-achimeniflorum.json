    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum achimeniflorum, commonly known as the Chilean rose or Chilean rockrose, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Chile and Argentina. It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
