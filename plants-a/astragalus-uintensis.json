    "intro": "Astragalus uintensis, commonly known as the Uinta milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, bean-like leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown pea-like flowers. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus uintensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
