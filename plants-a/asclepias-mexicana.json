    "intro": "Asclepias mexicana, commonly known as Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, pale yellow to orange flowers and its milky sap, which contains latex. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias mexicana is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the caterpillars and the adult insects."
