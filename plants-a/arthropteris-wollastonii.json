    "intro": "Arthropteris wollastonii, commonly known as the Wollaston's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically leathery and dark green in color. The plant is native to the temperate regions of the southern United States, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters known as sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Arthropteris wollastonii is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions."
