    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. scabrifolium, commonly known as roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its coarse, serrated leaf blades and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or brown. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
