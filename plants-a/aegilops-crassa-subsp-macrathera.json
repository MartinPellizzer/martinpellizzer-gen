    "intro": "Aegilops crassa subsp. macrathera, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in both ecological studies and agricultural research."
