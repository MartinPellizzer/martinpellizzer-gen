    "intro": "Andromeda serrata, commonly known as the serrated andromeda, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and it produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Andromeda serrata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
