    "intro": "Arisaema pallidum, commonly known as the pale arisaema, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the spadix, a common feature in the Araceae family. The pale arisaema is often found in moist, shaded forest environments and is valued for its ornamental appearance and medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine."
