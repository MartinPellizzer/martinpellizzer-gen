    "intro": "Androsace ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensis rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rosette-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals and a distinctive spurred structure. Androsace ochotensis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows."
