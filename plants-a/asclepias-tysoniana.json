    "intro": "Asclepias tysoniana, commonly known as the Tyson's milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among species in the Asclepias genus. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Tyson's milkweed serves as a vital food source for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators."
