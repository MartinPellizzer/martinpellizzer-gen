    "intro": "Astragalus novus, commonly known as the new milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. Native to arid and semi-arid regions, this species is adapted to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, Astragalus novus is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
