    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine calla, is a variant of the common arum characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves and showy, spatulate flowers. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a white or pale green spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species in the wild."
