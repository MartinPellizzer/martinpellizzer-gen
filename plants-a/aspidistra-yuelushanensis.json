    "intro": "Aspidistra yuelushanensis, commonly known as the Yuelushan aspidistra, is a rare evergreen perennial plant native to China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery, elliptical leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers surrounded by a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shady, humid environments and prefers well-draining, rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
