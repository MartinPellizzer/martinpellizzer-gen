    "intro": "Astrocaryum cohune, commonly known as the cohune palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by oval, hard-shelled fruits containing a single seed. Its trunk is valued for its durability and is often used in construction and furniture-making. The cohune palm also plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
