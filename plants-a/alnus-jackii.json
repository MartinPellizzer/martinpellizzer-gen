    "intro": "Alnus jackii, commonly known as the Chinese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, which are followed by small, round fruits called nutlets. Alnus jackii is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
