    "intro": "Arnica chandleri, commonly known as the showy arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and grows up to 30 inches tall, often in open meadows or rocky slopes. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic if ingested."
