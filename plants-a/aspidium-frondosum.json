    "intro": "Aspidium frondosum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium frondosum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
