    "intro": "Arundarbor helferi, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of delicate, pale blue or white flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
