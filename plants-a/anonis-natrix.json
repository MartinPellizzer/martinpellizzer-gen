It features dark green, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
