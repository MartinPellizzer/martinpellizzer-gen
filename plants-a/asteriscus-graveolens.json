    "intro": "Asteriscus graveolens, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features fragrant, small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces fluffy, white seed heads that persist through the winter. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The essential oils extracted from its leaves and flowers are used in aromatherapy and as a natural insect repellent."
