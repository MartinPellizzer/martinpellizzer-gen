    "intro": "Arabis serrata var. glauca, commonly known as the blue rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a bluish-gray waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
