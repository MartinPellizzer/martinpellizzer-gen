    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida subsp. teydensis, commonly known as the Teyden's Andryala, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. Its flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are small and white, arranged in clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
