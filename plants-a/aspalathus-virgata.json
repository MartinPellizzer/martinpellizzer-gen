    "intro": "Aspalathus virgata, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. Aspalathus virgata is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves are the primary part used in the production of the popular herbal tea."
