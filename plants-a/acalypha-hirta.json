    "intro": "Acalypha hirta, commonly known as velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive three-lobed seed capsules. Acalypha hirta is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and abandoned fields. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hirta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant is typically associated with lowland rainforests and is sometimes seen in disturbed or secondary vegetation. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. Acalypha hirta is also known to be cultivated in some parts of the world for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hirta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal and urban environments. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to establish itself in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
