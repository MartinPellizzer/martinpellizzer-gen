    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax aculeatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with dense forests. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of India and the Philippines. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of soil types, but it prefers well-drained, nutrient-rich soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax aculeatus was mainly introduced to new environments as a ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in various ecological niches, sometimes outcompeting native species. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in certain areas. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
