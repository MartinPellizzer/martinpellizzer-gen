    "intro": "Antennaria, commonly known as mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae). It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges. Antennaria species are often used in native plant gardens due to their hardy nature and ability to attract pollinators. Its common name reflects the shape of its leaves, which resemble the ears of a mouse."
