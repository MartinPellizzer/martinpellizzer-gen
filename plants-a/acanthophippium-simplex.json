    "intro": "Acanthophippium simplex, commonly known as the simple acanthophippium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to certain regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium simplex is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers. It is often associated with sandy or rocky soils along the Pacific coast. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium simplex was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate to high light exposure. This plant has shown adaptability to various environmental conditions, contributing to its spread in non-native regions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, further study is needed to fully understand its ecological impact."
