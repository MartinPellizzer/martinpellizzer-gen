    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. magna, commonly known as the large rock spleenwort, is a fern that thrives in rocky, calcareous environments. It is characterized by its robust, dark green fronds that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant forms dense mats on limestone or slate, often growing in crevices or on soil-covered rocks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. This variant is notable for its larger size and is often found in temperate regions with suitable moisture and light conditions."
