    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pastoris is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests or along stream banks. This species is also present in parts of southern China and the Philippines. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pastoris was mainly introduced to new environments due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. The plant has spread across various regions in Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils contribute to its successful establishment. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
