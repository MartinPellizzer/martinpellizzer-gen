    "intro": "Agrostis alpina var. aurata, commonly known as the golden alpine grass, is a variant of the alpine grass species native to high-altitude regions. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow inflorescence, which contrasts with the typical green or brown hues of other Agrostis species. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas and alpine meadows. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a tufted growth habit that allows it to withstand harsh weather conditions. The golden coloration of its flowers makes it a visually striking plant in its natural habitat."
