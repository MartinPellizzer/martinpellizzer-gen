    "intro": "Anisacantha bicuspis, commonly known as the two-toothed spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with two distinct teeth at the base. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. The species is noted for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care."
