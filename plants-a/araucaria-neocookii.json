    "intro": "Araucaria neocookii, commonly known as the Cook's Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of horizontal branches that form a distinctive umbrella-like shape. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for some indigenous peoples. Its foliage consists of scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. Araucaria neocookii is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soils."
