    "intro": "Axonopus pubivaginatus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both surfaces, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its adaptability makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
