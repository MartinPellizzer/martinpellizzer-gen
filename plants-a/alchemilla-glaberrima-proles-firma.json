    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima proles firma, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and erosion control."
