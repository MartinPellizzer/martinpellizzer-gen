    "intro": "Antrophyum jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's antrophyum, is a rare and enigmatic cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, a feature typical of cycads. Antrophyum jenmanii is adapted to grow in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
