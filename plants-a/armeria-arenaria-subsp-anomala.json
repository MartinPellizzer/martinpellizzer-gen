It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
