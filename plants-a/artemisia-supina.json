    "intro": "Artemisia supina, commonly known as creeping wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It features silver-gray, aromatic foliage with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in summer, contributing to its role in pollination. It is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, where it forms dense mats. Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally avoided in herbal remedies due to its strong, bitter taste."
