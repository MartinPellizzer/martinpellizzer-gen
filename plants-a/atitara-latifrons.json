It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and marshy areas. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth surface, and its flowers range in color from pink to deep red. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal in the wild."
