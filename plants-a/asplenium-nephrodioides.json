    "intro": "Asplenium nephrodioides, commonly known as the kidney-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. The plant has a distinctive, compact rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium nephrodioides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
