    "intro": "Aldama fruticosa, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, spiny leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its fruit is a capsule that contains seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
