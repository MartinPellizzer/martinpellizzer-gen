    "intro": "Acacia hemu, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically small and feathery. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. Acacia hemu thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. It is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

It is found in the dry and arid regions of the country, particularly in the southern and southwestern parts. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. It is commonly found in spiny forest and dry deciduous forest ecosystems. Acacia hemu plays an important role in the local flora and is well-suited to the unique environmental conditions of Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hemu was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has had both positive and negative ecological impacts, depending on the local environment. It is also valued for its ability to provide shade and habitat for native wildlife."
