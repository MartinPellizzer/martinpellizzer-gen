    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. balchikense, commonly known as the Balchik needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Russia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, awned florets. The plant typically thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates with cold winters. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that becomes more silvery in drought conditions. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
