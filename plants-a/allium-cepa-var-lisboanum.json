    "intro": "Allium cepa var. lisboanum, commonly known as the Lisbon shallot, is a botanical variant of the common onion. It is characterized by its small, round bulbs and mild, sweet flavor compared to regular onions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with strap-like leaves that are slightly narrower than those of the common onion. Its bulbs are usually white or pale yellow, and it is often cultivated for both culinary and ornamental purposes. This variety is well-suited to temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
