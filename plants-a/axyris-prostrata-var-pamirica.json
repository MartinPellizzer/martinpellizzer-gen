    "intro": "Axyris prostrata var. pamirica, commonly known as the Pamir sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short growing season of its alpine habitat. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, aiding in water retention in arid conditions. This variant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in mountainous regions of Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan."
