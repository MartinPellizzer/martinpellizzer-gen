    "intro": "Agrostis venusta, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, silvery-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish spikelets that are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Agrostis venusta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
