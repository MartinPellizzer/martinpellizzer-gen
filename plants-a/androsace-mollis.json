    "intro": "Androsace mollis, commonly known as the fairy sedge or moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its leaves are typically basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. Androsace mollis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or gravelly soils."
