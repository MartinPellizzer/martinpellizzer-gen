    "intro": "Acantholimon glabratum subsp. kashanense, commonly known as Kashan's sandwort, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in spring. It is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to survive in nutrient-poor, sandy soils.",
