    "intro": "Ardisia elliptica var. solanacea, commonly known as the purple-leafed ardisia, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, elliptical leaves that range from dark green to deep purple, depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is well-suited for container gardening or as a specimen plant in shaded gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and seasonal berries."
