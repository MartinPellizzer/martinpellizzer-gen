    "intro": "Asplenium linguiforme, commonly known as the tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that resemble a tongue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to its substrate. Asplenium linguiforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
