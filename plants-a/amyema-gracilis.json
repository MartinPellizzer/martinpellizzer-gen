    "intro": "Amyema gracilis, commonly known as the slender swamp gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It typically grows in wet or swampy areas, often in association with other moisture-loving plants. The tree has smooth, grey bark that becomes fissured with age, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a glossy upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Amyema gracilis is valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife and its ability to thrive in poorly drained soils."
