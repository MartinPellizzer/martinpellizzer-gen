    "intro": "Aster hirtus, commonly known as the hairy aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open areas such as meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments. The showy purple or pink flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
