    "intro": "Astragalus gilvus, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Astragalus gilvus is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
