    "intro": "Ageratella, commonly known as blueweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their small, often blue or purple flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Ageratella species are typically found in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and the plants often have a distinctive, aromatic scent. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
