    "intro": "Aralia schefflera, commonly known as the umbrella plant, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble an umbrella, typically arranged in a single plane at the end of each stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. Aralia schefflera is a popular indoor plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
