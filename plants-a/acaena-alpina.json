    "intro": "Acaena alpina, commonly known as the Alpine woodrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. Acaena alpina is well adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in rocky soils and cold climates.",

This plant is commonly found in high-altitude regions within these areas. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in grasslands. Acaena alpina is well adapted to the cold and harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena alpina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. Its introduction has had both ecological and agricultural impacts."
