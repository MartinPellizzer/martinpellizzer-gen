    "intro": "Amauropelta loreae, commonly known as the Lorea's shield fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant originates from the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
