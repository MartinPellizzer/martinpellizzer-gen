    "intro": "Artemisia lipskyi, commonly known as the Karakoram wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Artemisia lipskyi plays a significant role in the ecological balance of its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various alpine species."
