    "intro": "Alliaria alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It has heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its roots contain compounds that can inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions. The leaves and seeds are edible but can be pungent and are sometimes used in cooking or traditional medicine."
