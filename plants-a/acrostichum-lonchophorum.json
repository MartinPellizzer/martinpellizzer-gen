    "intro": "Acrostichum lonchophorum, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large fern species native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife.",
