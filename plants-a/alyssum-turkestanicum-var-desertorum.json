    "intro": "Alyssum turkestanicum var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with silvery-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for dryland landscapes."
