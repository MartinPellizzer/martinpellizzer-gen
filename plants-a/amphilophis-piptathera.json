    "intro": "Amphilophis piptathera, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Amphilophis piptathera plays an important ecological role in supporting native insect populations, particularly monarch butterflies."
