    "intro": "Archidendron fagifolium var. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement, and its flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences. It produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Due to its ecological importance and slow growth rate, it is often threatened by deforestation and habitat loss."
