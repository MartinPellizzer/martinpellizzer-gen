    "intro": "Astragalus crotalariae var. anemophilus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a legume belonging to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pale green flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, a feature reflected in its common name. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in harsh environments."
