    "intro": "Alyssum markgrafii var. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant produces seed pods that split open to release its small, rounded seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
