    "intro": "Armeria scorzonerifolia, commonly known as the sea thrift or coastal thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
