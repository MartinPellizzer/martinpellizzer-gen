    "intro": "Agrostis borealis, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize the soil in harsh conditions. Agrostis borealis plays a vital role in the ecosystem by providing food for herbivores and contributing to soil structure in extreme climates."
