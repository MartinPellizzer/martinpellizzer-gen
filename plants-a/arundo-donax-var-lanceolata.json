    "intro": "Arundo donax var. lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features long, slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet or moist environments, making it common along waterways and in marshy areas. It has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively, sometimes becoming invasive. Its hollow, bamboo-like stems are used in basket-making and as a source of natural fiber."
