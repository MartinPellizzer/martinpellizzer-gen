    "intro": "Asplenium arcanum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium arcanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
