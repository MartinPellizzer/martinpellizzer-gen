    "intro": "Aporosa arborescens, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmately lobed leaves that often display vibrant red veins against a green or yellow background. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal."
