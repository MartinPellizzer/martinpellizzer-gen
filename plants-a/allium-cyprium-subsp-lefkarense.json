    "intro": "Allium cyprium subsp. lefkarense, commonly known as the Lefkara leek, is a botanical variant native to Cyprus. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical bulbs and grass-like foliage. The plant produces umbels of small, pale purple or white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in Mediterranean botany."
