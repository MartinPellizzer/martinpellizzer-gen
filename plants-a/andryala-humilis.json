    "intro": "Andryala humilis, commonly known as the lesser arnica, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. Its roots are fibrous and used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Andryala humilis thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
