    "intro": "Angraecum fimbriatipetalum, commonly known as the fringed petal angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers with intricate, fringed petals. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators like moths. Its epiphytic nature allows it to grow on trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade."
