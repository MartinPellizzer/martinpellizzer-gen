    "intro": "Abies krylovii, commonly known as the Krylov fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The cones of this species are typically pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited commercial use due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies krylovii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Siberia, including parts of the Russian Federation. It is commonly found in the Altai Mountains, the Sayano-Shushenskaya region, and the Tannu-Ola mountain range. This species thrives in cold, high-altitude environments with well-drained soils. It is often associated with coniferous forests and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Abies krylovii is a rare and relict species, reflecting the ancient flora of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies krylovii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevations or northern latitudes. It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and sufficient precipitation throughout the growing season. This plant is often found in mountainous regions where it can form dense forests or stand alone as an ornamental species. Its introduction has been primarily for landscaping and reforestation purposes due to its aesthetic value and ecological benefits. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and climate constraints."
