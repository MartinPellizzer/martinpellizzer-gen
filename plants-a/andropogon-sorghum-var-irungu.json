    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. irungu, commonly known as irungu sorghum, is a variant of sorghum native to East Africa. It is a tall, robust grass with dense, fibrous stalks that are well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to golden flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a waxy coating that reduces water loss. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and is often used for forage, fuel, and traditional crafts in local communities."
