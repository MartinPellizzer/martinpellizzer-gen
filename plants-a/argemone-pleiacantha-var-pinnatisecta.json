    "intro": "Argemone pleiacantha var. pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf argemone, is a flowering plant native to parts of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its slender, pinnatisected leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent red or orange markings at the base of the petals. It thrives in arid or semi-arid conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The seeds of this species are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by animals."
