    "intro": "Ajuga disticha, commonly known as carpet bugle or silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Ajuga disticha is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
