    "intro": "Aconitum macilentum, commonly known as the slender aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spikelike inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. Aconitum macilentum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
