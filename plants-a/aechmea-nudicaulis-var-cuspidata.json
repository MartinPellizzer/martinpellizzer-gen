    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis var. cuspidata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped air plant, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they have a pointed tip that distinguishes this variety from others. It produces striking red or orange flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
