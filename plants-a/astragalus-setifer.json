    "intro": "Astragalus setifer, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Astragalus setifer is often found in dry, sandy soils and can thrive in disturbed areas. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
