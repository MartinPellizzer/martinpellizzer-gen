    "intro": "Astragalus coltonii var. aphyllus, commonly known as the leafless milkvetch, is a rare and endemic species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a short, hairy stem and reduced leaves that are often absent or highly modified. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
