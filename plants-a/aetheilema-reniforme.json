    "intro": "Aetheilema reniforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically oval or kidney-shaped, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Its unique morphology and adaptive traits make it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
