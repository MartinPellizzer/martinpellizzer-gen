    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers in early summer, which are often borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
