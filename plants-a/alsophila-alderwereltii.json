    "intro": "Alsophila alderwereltii, commonly known as the Alderwerelt's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species in its natural habitat. Its rhizomes are fibrous and contribute to the structural support of the plant, while its spore-producing cones are typically found at the base of the fronds. This species plays an important ecological role in its native forests, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
