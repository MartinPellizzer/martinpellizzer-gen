It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit with hairy, bluish-gray foliage. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
