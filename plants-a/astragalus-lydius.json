    "intro": "Astragalus lydius, commonly known as the Lydian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain seeds. Astragalus lydius is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
