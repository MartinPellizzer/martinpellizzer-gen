    "intro": "Aechmea koesteri, commonly known as the Koester's bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called trichomes, which help in water absorption and protection against intense sunlight. Aechmea koesteri is a popular ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
