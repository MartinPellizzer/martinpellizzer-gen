    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha anisodonta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with rainforests and secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha anisodonta was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, wastelands, and agricultural fields. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it common in regions with warm temperatures and moderate to high rainfall. The plant spreads primarily through its prolific seed production and ability to establish itself in nutrient-poor soils. It is often considered an invasive species in parts of its introduced range due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native habitat, posing challenges to local ecosystems in some regions."
