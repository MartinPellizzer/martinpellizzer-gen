It belongs to the family Selaginellaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and spore-producing structures. This plant thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand high salinity and arid conditions. Arthrocnemum littoreum is an important component of coastal ecosystems in regions such as the Mediterranean and the Arabian Peninsula."
