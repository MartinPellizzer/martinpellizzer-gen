    "intro": "Angraecum sedenii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and large, fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like hawkmoths. Angraecum sedenii is notable for its unique adaptation to its specific ecological niche and is a symbol of botanical rarity."
