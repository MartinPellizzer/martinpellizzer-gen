    "intro": "Angraecum flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant's unique morphology includes long, narrow leaves and a specialized inflorescence that attracts specific nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
