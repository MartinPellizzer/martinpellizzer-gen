    "intro": "Andropogon arenarius, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically reddish-brown in color. It is drought-tolerant and plays an important role in stabilizing soil in sandy environments. Its growth habit makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
