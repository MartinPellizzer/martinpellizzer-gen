    "intro": "Acer mono f. septemlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed maple, is a unique variant of the maple tree characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically featuring seven distinct lobes, which set it apart from the more common five-lobed maple varieties. This plant is native to specific regions in eastern Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The bark of Acer mono f. septemlobum is smooth and light gray, becoming more rugged with age. It produces small, red samaras in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes.",
