    "intro": "Alseis microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited alseis, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, woodland habitats. Alseis microcarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
