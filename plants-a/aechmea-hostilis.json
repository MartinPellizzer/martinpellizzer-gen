It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround the flower, giving it its common name. The plant features a rosette of grass-like leaves that collect water, forming a central reservoir. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. Aechmea hostilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
