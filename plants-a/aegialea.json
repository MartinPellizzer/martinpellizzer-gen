    "intro": "Aegialea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, blue or purple flowers that resemble small holly berries, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to salty, well-drained soils. Aegialea species are perennial herbs with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy composite flowers. These plants are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value."
