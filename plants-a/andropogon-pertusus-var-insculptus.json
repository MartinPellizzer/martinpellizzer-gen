It is a perennial grass characterized by its coarse, upright growth habit and bluish-green foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of a dense, cylindrical cluster of spikelets. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. This grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
