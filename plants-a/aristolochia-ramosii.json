    "intro": "Aristolochia ramosii, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and herbal practices."
