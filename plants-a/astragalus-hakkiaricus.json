    "intro": "Astragalus hakkiaricus, commonly known as the Hakkiaric milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Turkey and northern Iraq. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It produces pods that contain small, hard seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or through animal activity. Astragalus hakkiaricus is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
