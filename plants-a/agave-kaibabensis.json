    "intro": "Agave kaibabensis, commonly known as the Kaibab agave, is a rare and unique species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and large, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It produces tall inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
