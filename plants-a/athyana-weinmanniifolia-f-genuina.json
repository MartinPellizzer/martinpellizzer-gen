    "intro": "Athyana weinmanniifolia f. genuina, commonly known as the Hawaiian treefern, is a unique fern species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its large, tree-like fronds that can reach several meters in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem covered in a thick, fibrous layer that resembles bark. Its fronds are bioluminescent, a rare trait among ferns, and emit a soft blue glow at night. This botanical feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
