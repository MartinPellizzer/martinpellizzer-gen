    "intro": "Andropogon tener var. pilosus, commonly known as hairy flatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and prairies, and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding. Its leaves are narrow, grassy, and covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small and often inconspicuous compared to the foliage."
