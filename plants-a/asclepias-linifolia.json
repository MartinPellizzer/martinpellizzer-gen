    "intro": "Asclepias linifolia, commonly known as the wooly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its grayish-green, woolly leaves and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Asclepias linifolia serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
