    "intro": "Acalypha rubrinervis, commonly known as the red-veined strobilus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its strikingly colorful leaves, which often display vibrant red and green veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and requires partial to full sunlight. Acalypha rubrinervis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various growing conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha rubrinervis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense forests. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Its native distribution includes both mainland Southeast Asia and various island archipelagos in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha rubrinervis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native ornamental species."
