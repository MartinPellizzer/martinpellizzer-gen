    "intro": "Arenaria nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. Its root system is fibrous and helps anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Arenaria nevadensis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine insects and microorganisms."
