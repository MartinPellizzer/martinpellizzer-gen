    "intro": "Antennaria monocephala subsp. philonipha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-eared cow-wheat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
