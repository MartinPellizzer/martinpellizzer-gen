    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuis var. eglandulosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes seen in disturbed or secondary vegetation. It is known for its distinctive leaf morphology and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuis var. eglandulosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The distribution of this plant is primarily confined to the North Island, where it has been cultivated in gardens and along roadsides. Although it is not considered invasive, it has become naturalized in some areas. Its presence in New Zealand highlights the role of human activity in the spread of non-native plant species."
