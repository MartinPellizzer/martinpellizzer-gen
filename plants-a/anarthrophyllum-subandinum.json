    "intro": "Anarthrophyllum subandinum, commonly known as the Andean dwarf palm, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features a short, unbranched stem with a tuft of stiff, grass-like leaves at the top. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
