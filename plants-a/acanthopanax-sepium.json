It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in mountainous areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often associated with forested regions and can be found in both deciduous and evergreen forests. It is particularly common in the Korean Peninsula and the eastern parts of China, including the provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, and Yunnan. Its natural habitat extends to parts of Russia and Southeast Asia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax sepium was mainly introduced to regions where its medicinal properties are valued, particularly in East Asia. It is commonly found in countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, where it has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in forested areas or as an ornamental plant. Its introduction has also led to its presence in some parts of North America and Europe due to horticultural interest. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
