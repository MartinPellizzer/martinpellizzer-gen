    "intro": "Arenaria fulungensis, commonly known as the Fulung sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of northern China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Arenaria fulungensis is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient species in semi-desert ecosystems."
