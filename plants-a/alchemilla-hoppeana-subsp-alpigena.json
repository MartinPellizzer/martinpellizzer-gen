    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. alpigena, commonly known as alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
