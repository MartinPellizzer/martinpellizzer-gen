    "intro": "Arabis gunnisoniana, commonly known as Gunnison's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
