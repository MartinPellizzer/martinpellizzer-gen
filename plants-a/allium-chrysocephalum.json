    "intro": "Allium chrysocephalum, commonly known as golden head garlic, is a perennial herb native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flower heads that resemble a cluster of small bulbs. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a strong garlic scent. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal areas. The bulbous structure of its flowers is a key botanical feature, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
