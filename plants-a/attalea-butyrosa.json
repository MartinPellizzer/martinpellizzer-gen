    "intro": "Attalea butyrosa, commonly known as the oil palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America. It produces large, fan-shaped leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that develop into fruiting structures called infrutescences. The fruit contains a fatty, oily pulp that is rich in nutrients and used in various food products. The plant is also valued for its ability to grow in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and agricultural contexts."
