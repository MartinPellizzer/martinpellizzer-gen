    "intro": "Anacheilium terassanianum, commonly known as the Transylvanian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Romania. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its unique appearance and limited habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and climate change, it is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
