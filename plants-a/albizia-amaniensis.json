    "intro": "Albizia amaniensis, commonly known as the East African siris, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The tree produces long, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Albizia amaniensis is often found in savannas and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it useful for reforestation and as a source of timber and fodder."
