    "intro": "Anthoxanthum pallidum, commonly known as the pale false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, pale green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to brown florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
