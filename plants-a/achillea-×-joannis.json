    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 joannis, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a cross between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (sneezeweed), resulting in a plant with a compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces dense clusters of small, fluffy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of finely divided, silver-green leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Achillea \u00d7 joannis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.",
