    "intro": "Agrostis glabra var. melanthes, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairless or sparsely hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its botanical features make it a common weed in turfgrass systems and a valuable plant for erosion control. It is also utilized in some horticultural settings for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
