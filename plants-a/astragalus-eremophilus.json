    "intro": "Astragalus eremophilus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or semi-desert environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep roots and reduced leaf surface. Astragalus eremophilus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
