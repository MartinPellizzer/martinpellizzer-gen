    "intro": "Astragalus oxyglottis var. psiloglottis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The leaves are typically bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This plant is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
