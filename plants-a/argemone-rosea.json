    "intro": "Argemone rosea, commonly known as the Mexican buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are small and covered in a sticky substance. Argemone rosea is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid environments."
