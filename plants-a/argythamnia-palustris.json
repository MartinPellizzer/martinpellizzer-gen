    "intro": "Argythamnia palustris, commonly known as the marsh thistle, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts. It has a taproot system and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Argythamnia palustris plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated soil."
