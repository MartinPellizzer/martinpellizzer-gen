    "intro": "Acantholimon homophyllum, commonly known as the smoothleaf desert sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon homophyllum is primarily native to Afghanistan. This plant is commonly found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. The species is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in the local flora of Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon homophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in environments where there is limited water availability, making it suitable for xeriscaping and low-maintenance gardens. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive, spiny foliage and flowering stems. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in the United States. Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes become invasive in areas where it is not properly managed."
