    "intro": "Aristida pruinosa var. tenuis, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are covered in a waxy layer, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in dense spikelets, which are typically arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
