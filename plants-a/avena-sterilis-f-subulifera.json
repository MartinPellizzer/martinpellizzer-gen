    "intro": "Avena sterilis f. subulifera, commonly known as the slender oat, is a subspecies of the wild oat characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are usually non-shattering, making them suitable for collection and propagation. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
