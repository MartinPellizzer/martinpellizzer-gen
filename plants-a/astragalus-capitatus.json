    "intro": "Astragalus capitatus, commonly known as the clustered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is known for its nitrogen-fixing abilities through symbiotic bacteria. Astragalus capitatus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
