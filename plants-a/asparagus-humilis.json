    "intro": "Asparagus humilis, commonly known as the dwarf asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers, which are followed by tiny, edible berries. Its foliage consists of thin, needle-like leaves that are typically bright green. Asparagus humilis is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
