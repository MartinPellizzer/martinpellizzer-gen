    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum f. obtusatum, commonly known as the obtuseleaf alissum, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. This variety is distinguished by its obtuse (rounded) leaf tips, which set it apart from the typical form of *Alyssum tortuosum*. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
