    "intro": "Alchemilla chthamalea, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, dark green leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, sunny landscapes."
