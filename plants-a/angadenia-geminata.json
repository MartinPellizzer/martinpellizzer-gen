    "intro": "Angadenia geminata, commonly known as the twin-flowered orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its two prominent, showy flowers that bloom on a single stem, often in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it typically grows in wetlands or along the edges of freshwater habitats. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
