    "intro": "Antidesma cuspidatum, commonly known as the African starfruit or yellow starfruit, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, and parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often serrated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by fruits that are typically star-shaped and yellow when ripe. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and unique fruit structure, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation in warm climates."
