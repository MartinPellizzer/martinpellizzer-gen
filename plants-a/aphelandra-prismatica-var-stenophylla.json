    "intro": "Aphelandra prismatica var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf flame tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, sword-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are not true flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
