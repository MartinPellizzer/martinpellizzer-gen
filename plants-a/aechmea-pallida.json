    "intro": "Aechmea pallida, commonly known as the silver vulture, is a species of bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, powdery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces a tall, flower-bearing stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in the summer. Aechmea pallida thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservatories."
