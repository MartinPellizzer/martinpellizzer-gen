    "intro": "Allium vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the volcanic regions of Italy. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of volcanic landscapes. Its bulbs are often used in traditional cooking, similar to other Allium species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
