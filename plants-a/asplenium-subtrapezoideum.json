    "intro": "Asplenium subtrapezoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium subtrapezoideum is known for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-adapted to its natural habitat."
