    "intro": "Achyrobaccharis, commonly known as the golden aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They are characterized by their showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in the spring and summer seasons. The leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, with a rough texture, and the plants can grow up to several feet tall. Achyrobaccharis species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral displays."
