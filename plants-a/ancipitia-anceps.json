    "intro": "Ancipitia anceps, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has a unique appearance, with long, slender leaves and a single, delicate flower that resembles a ghostly figure. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a lack of true stems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
