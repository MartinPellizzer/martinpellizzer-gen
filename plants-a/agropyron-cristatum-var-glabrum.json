It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally hairless, giving it its varietal name \"glabrum.\" The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine, arctic, and steppe environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
