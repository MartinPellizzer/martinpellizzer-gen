    "intro": "Astragalus emarginatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive narrow, linear shape. Its small, yellowish to greenish flowers are clustered in dense, globular heads, and it produces elongated pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus emarginatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
