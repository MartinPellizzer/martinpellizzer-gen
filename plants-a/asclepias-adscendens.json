It is characterized by its erect, branching stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Asclepias adscendens is also known for its latex sap, which contains compounds used in traditional medicine and as a source of cardenolides for monarch butterfly larvae."
