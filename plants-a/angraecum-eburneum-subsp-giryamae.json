    "intro": "Angraecum eburneum subsp. giryamae, commonly known as the Giryama orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the arid regions of Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and striking, pale green to white flowers with intricate, spidery petals. The plant thrives in high-altitude, rocky habitats where it relies on specific pollinators, such as the giant sphinx moth. Its morphology is adapted to its harsh environment, with a long flowering period that coincides with the brief rainy season. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements."
