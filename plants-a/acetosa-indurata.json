    "intro": "Acetosa indurata, commonly known as the hard-stemmed mouse-ear, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Acetosa indurata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens.",
