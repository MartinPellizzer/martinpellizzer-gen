    "intro": "Alnus japonica var. rufa, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, spherical catkins that appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Alnus japonica var. rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve soil quality through nitrogen fixation."
