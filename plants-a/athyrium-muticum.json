    "intro": "Athyrium muticum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night. This unique trait makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
