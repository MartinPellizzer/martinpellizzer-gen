    "intro": "Aegonychon repens, commonly known as the creeping aegonychon, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit. It features small, elongated leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has adapted to harsh environments through mechanisms such as deep root systems and water-storing tissues. Aegonychon repens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
