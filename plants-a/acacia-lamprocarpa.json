    "intro": "Acacia lamprocarpa, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow, globular flower heads that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia lamprocarpa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lamprocarpa is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the dry and harsh environments of northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lamprocarpa was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid regions, where it forms dense thickets. The plant is also used in rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and capacity to stabilize soils. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is now largely restricted to the regions where it was initially introduced."
