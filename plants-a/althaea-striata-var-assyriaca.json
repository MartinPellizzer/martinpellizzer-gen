    "intro": "Althaea striata var. assyriaca, commonly known as the Assyrian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It features showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has thick, fleshy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly texture. Its roots produce a mucilaginous substance, which has been historically used in traditional medicine. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland habitats."
