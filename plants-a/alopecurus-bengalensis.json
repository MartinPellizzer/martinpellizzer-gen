    "intro": "Alopecurus bengalensis, commonly known as the Bengal mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and marshes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
