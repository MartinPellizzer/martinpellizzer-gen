    "intro": "Aechmea suaveolens var. longifolia, commonly known as the fragrant pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. The plant features long, slender leaves with a waxy, blue-green hue, and it produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red bracts. Its flowers are small and clustered, often giving way to offsets or \"pups\" for propagation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
