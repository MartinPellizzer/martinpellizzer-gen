It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with prominent marginal teeth and a smooth, waxy texture. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure."
