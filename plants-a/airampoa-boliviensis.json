    "intro": "Airampoa boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly Bolivia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, adapted to thrive in dry and semi-arid environments. Airampoa boliviensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
