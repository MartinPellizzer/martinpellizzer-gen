    "intro": "Ajuga iva var. spathulifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats. It has a fibrous root system and spreads by stolons, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native landscaping."
