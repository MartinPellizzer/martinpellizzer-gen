It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish bloom. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
