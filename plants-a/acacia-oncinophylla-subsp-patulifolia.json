This subspecies is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Geraldton region. It typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. The plant is commonly found in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oncinophylla subsp. patulifolia was mainly introduced to regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and open woodlands. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens and parks. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora in areas where it has been released."
