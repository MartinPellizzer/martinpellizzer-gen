    "intro": "Achnatherum lettermanii, commonly known as Letterman's needlegrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Achnatherum lettermanii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",
