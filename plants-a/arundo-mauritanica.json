    "intro": "Arundo mauritanica, commonly known as the Mauritania reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found along coastal areas and in marshy environments. The plant can grow up to 4 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often used for thatching or as a source of fiber. It is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in coastal and wetland habitats. Its flowering spikes produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated."
