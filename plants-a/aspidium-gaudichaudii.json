It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant has fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
