    "intro": "Acaena acroglochin, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spinetree, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive burrs containing seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Acaena acroglochin plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for native birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena acroglochin is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is often associated with dry, open environments and is well adapted to the local climate. Acaena acroglochin plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena acroglochin was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by animals and water. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both coastal and inland areas."
