    "intro": "Albizia paludosa, commonly known as swamp albizia, is a shrub or small tree native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with numerous small, oval leaflets that are often arranged in pairs. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, making it an important species in wetland restoration. Albizia paludosa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
