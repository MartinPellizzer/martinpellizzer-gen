It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. This cultivar is valued for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun conditions. It has been widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in border plantings and container gardens. However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively in certain environments if not properly managed."
