    "intro": "Acantholimon calocephalum, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important component of mountain ecosystems.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant typically grows in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. It is adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. Acantholimon calocephalum is an important component of the local flora in these high-altitude environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon calocephalum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in pastures, and in open fields. This plant thrives in regions with low to moderate rainfall and is often associated with coastal or inland dune ecosystems. Its introduction has been documented in several western states of the United States, where it has become naturalized in some areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
