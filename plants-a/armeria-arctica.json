    "intro": "Armeria arctica, commonly known as the Arctic thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often forming mats that stabilize rocky or sandy terrain. Armeria arctica is a hardy species adapted to extreme climates, making it a characteristic component of tundra ecosystems."
