    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha consimilis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forests or along riverbanks. It is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha consimilis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country due to its ability to spread rapidly. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
