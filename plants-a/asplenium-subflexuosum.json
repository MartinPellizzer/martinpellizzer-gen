It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that typically grow in dense mats. The leaves are usually lanceolate to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. This plant is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and its role in ecological succession in forest ecosystems."
