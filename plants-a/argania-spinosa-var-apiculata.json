    "intro": "Argania spinosa var. apiculata, commonly known as the Saharan almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the Maghreb. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, oval-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by edible, nut-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife and humans. Its roots are highly drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in sandy, nutrient-poor soils. This variant is closely related to the more widely known Argania spinosa, but it exhibits distinct morphological features, particularly in its leaf and fruit structure."
