    "intro": "Acaena pallida, commonly known as the slender burrplant, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a woolly, fibrous coating. The plant typically thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, where it forms dense mats on the ground. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered with fine hairs. Acaena pallida plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pallida is primarily native to New Zealand North, New Zealand South, and Tasmania. It is commonly found in various habitats across these regions, including coastal areas, forest margins, and rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with moist, well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing food and habitat for local wildlife. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is sometimes considered a rare or threatened species in certain areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pallida was mainly introduced to California, New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. It was likely introduced as an ornamental plant or for erosion control due to its hardy nature. The plant has since spread and established itself in these regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its distribution in these areas is attributed to human activity and favorable environmental conditions. It is now considered a weed in some parts of its introduced range."
