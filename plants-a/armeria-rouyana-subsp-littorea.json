    "intro": "Armeria rouyana subsp. littorea, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial herb native to coastal areas of western Europe. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in dunes, rock crevices, and other coastal habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
