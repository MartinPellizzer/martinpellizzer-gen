    "intro": "Asplenium pseudostuhlmannii, commonly known as the false stuhlmann's spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color and a slightly hairy texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a single row. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
