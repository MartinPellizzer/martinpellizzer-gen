    "intro": "Antrophyum marginale, commonly known as the white antarctic plant, is a rare and frost-tolerant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its unique adaptations allow it to thrive in extreme environments with limited nutrients and intense sunlight. Due to its fragile habitat, it is considered vulnerable to climate change and habitat destruction."
