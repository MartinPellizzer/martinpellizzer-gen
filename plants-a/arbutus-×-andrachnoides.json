It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by edible, dark red berries. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in maritime climates."
