    "intro": "Astragalus labradoricus, commonly known as Labrador milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically compound, with multiple small leaflets arranged along the stem. Astragalus labradoricus is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
