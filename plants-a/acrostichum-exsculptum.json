    "intro": "Acrostichum exsculptum, commonly known as the ridged fern, is a species of fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often deeply divided and have a distinctive ridged appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found near streams or in dense undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Acrostichum exsculptum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various insects and small animals.",
