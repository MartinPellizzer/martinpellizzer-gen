    "intro": "Aegilops kotschyi var. brachyathera, commonly known as the shortawn goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, stiff awns on its inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces small, spike-like flower clusters. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability to harsh conditions."
