    "intro": "Alsophila dorsalis, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are released into the air for dispersal. Alsophila dorsalis plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
