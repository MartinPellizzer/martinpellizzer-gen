    "intro": "Aspidistra pileata, commonly known as the pileate aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by dark blue berries. Aspidistra pileata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
