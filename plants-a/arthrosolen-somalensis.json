    "intro": "Arthrosolen somalensis, commonly known as the Somali rock orchid, is a rare and specialized flowering plant native to the arid regions of Somalia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique adaptations to extreme desert conditions. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and has small, delicate flowers that bloom during brief periods of rainfall. Its botanical structure includes fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves, which help it conserve water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
