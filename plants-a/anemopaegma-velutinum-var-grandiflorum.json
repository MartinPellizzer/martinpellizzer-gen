    "intro": "Anemopaegma velutinum var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf anemopaegma, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, round berries that contain the seeds."
