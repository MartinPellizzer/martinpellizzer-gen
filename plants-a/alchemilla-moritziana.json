It features a rosette of soft, velvety, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla moritziana is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
