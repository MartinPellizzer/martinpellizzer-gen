    "intro": "Anogra pallida var. runcinata, commonly known as the pale anogra with notched leaves, is a lesser-known plant species within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, pale green foliage that often has a distinctive notched or lobed edge. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
