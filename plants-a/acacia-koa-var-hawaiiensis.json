    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia koa var. hawaiiensis is primarily native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically the island of Hawaii. This plant is found in the wetter, more mesic to wet forest habitats of the island's highlands. It thrives in areas with consistent rainfall and well-drained soils. The species is part of the Acacia genus, which is native to various parts of the world, but this particular variety is endemic to Hawaii. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable component of Hawaii's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia koa var. hawaiiensis was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique appearance. It was also used in traditional Hawaiian practices and for its valuable timber. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. Despite its popularity, it is not widely cultivated outside of Hawaii. Its distribution remains primarily limited to the island of Hawaii."
