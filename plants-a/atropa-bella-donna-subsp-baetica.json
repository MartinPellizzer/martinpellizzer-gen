    "intro": "Atropa bella-donna subsp. baetica, commonly known as the Baetica belladonna, is a subspecies native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dark green, ovate leaves and striking bell-shaped flowers that range from purple to white. The plant contains toxic alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine, which have historically been used in medicine and as a poison. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes."
