    "intro": "Albizia procera, commonly known as the African silk tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feathery leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its pods are long and flat, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Albizia procera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
