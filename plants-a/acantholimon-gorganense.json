    "intro": "Acantholimon gorganense, commonly known as the Gorgan flaxflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia, particularly Iran. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",

This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the diverse plant life in Iran's inland regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gorganense was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low precipitation and high solar exposure, making it suitable for rocky or coastal landscapes. This plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and can tolerate salt spray, which allows it to colonize coastal dunes and cliffs. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions where these environmental conditions are met. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental or ecological purposes."
