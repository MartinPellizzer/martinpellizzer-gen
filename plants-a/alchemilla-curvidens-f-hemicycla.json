    "intro": "Alchemilla curvidens f. hemicycla, commonly known as the silverleaf alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, rounded clusters during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its ornate appearance and drought tolerance. This variety is particularly valued for its ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
