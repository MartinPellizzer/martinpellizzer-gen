    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. retrofracta, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are typically rosette-forming. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
