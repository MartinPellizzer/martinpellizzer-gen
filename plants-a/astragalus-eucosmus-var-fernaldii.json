The plant has pinnately compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
