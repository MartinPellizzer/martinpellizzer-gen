    "intro": "Antirrhinum porcinum, commonly known as the pig's garlic or pig's onion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Antirrhinum porcinum is also known for its mild, garlic-like scent, which becomes more pronounced when the plant is stressed or in bloom."
