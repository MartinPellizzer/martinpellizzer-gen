    "intro": "Andropogon ekmanii, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces panicles of small, spikelet-based flowers in late summer. It is well adapted to fire-prone environments and plays an important role in maintaining ecological balance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization."
