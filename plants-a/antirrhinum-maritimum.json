    "intro": "Antirrhinum maritimum, commonly known as the sea campion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink or red flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, dunes, and other maritime environments. Antirrhinum maritimum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
