It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
