    "intro": "Alchemilla ruwenzoriensis, commonly known as the Ruwenzori alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Ruwenzori Mountains in eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces basal leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
