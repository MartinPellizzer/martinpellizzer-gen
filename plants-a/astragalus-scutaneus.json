    "intro": "Astragalus scutaneus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Astragalus scutaneus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
