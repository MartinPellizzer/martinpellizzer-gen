    "intro": "Agnostus, commonly known as the sea lily, is an extinct group of echinoderms that lived during the Cambrian period. These ancient creatures had a distinctive morphology, featuring a central calyx surrounded by arms that were used for filter feeding. They were typically sessile, attaching themselves to the seafloor with a holdfast. Agnostus species are characterized by their bilateral symmetry and complex internal structures, including a well-developed water vascular system. Their fossils provide important insights into the early evolution of marine ecosystems."
