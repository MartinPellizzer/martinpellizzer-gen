    "intro": "Aster uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces a single, showy blue to purple flower at the end of each flowering stem. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster uniflorus is often found in moist meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks."
