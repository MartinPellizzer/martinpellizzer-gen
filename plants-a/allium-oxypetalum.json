    "intro": "Allium oxypetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic or the red garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous structure is similar to other Allium species, though it is distinguished by its narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a mild garlic scent when crushed."
