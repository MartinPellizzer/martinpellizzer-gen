It belongs to the family Arachnophyta, which is distinguished by its specialized structures for water retention. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate, making it a rare and sought-after specimen in botanical collections. Its leaves are finely divided, creating a delicate, lace-like appearance that sets it apart from other species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
