It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are divided into lance-shaped segments with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
