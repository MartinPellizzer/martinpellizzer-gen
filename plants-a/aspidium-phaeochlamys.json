    "intro": "Aspidium phaeochlamys, commonly known as the dark frond fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically elongated and pinnately divided. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium phaeochlamys thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
