    "intro": "Aster subulatus var. obtusifolius, commonly known as the blunt-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, decorative plants."
