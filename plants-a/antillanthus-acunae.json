    "intro": "Antillanthus acunae, commonly known as the Cuban orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Cuba. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and is often found in specific forested areas. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
