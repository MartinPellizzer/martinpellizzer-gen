    "intro": "Anemopaegma scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough anemopaegma, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or orange, and they bloom in the spring or early summer."
