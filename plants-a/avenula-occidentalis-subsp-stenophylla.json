    "intro": "Avenula occidentalis subsp. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf avenula, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions and open woodlands. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and slightly curled at the edges. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
