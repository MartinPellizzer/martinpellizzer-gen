    "intro": "Aiouea goyazensis, commonly known as the Goyazensis hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a smooth surface with a slightly waxy texture. Aiouea goyazensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small fauna."
