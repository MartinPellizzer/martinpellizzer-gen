    "intro": "Astragalus milingensis var. paucijugus, commonly known as the few-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It has a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper underground, making it resilient to drought. This variety is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
