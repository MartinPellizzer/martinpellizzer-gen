    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 yasujensis, commonly known as the Yasujin peach, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus persica (peach) and Prunus davidiana (Davidian apricot). It is native to China and is characterized by its medium-sized, oval-shaped fruits with a smooth, thin skin. The flowers are typically pinkish-white and bloom in early spring, preceding the fruit development. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also cultivated for its edible fruit, which has a sweet and aromatic flavor. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for temperate climates."
