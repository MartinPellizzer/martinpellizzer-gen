    "intro": "Aganosma kwangsiensis var. longilobata, commonly known as the Guangxi aganosma, is a rare and lesser-known plant species native to China. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. The leaves are typically elliptical with long lobes, giving it a unique appearance compared to other members of the genus. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
