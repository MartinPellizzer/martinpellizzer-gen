    "intro": "Atriplex pamparum, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. Atriplex pamparum is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in poor, saline conditions."
