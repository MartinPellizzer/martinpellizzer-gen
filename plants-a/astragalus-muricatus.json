    "intro": "Astragalus muricatus, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus muricatus has adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it resilient to drought conditions."
