    "intro": "Alchornea glabra, commonly known as the velvetleaf or smooth alchornea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous bark and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Alchornea glabra is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
