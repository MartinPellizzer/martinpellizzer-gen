    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. asplenioides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common lady fern. It is a deciduous fern native to eastern North America, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bipinnate, with finely divided, arching leaves that give it a graceful appearance."
