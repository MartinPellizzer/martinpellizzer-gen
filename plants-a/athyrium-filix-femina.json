    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina, commonly known as the lady fern, is a fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a lady's fan, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
