    "intro": "Aphelandra cajatambensis, commonly known as the Tumbes aphelandra, is a species of flowering plant native to the western Amazon Basin. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with bright yellow bracts that enclose small, fragrant flowers. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
