It features small, pale yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
