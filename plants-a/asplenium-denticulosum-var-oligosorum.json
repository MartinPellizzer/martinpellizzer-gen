    "intro": "Asplenium denticulosum var. oligosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices, preferring cool and humid conditions. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, upright fronds that are often covered in fine, tooth-like serrations. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. This variety is noted for its compact size and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shaded gardens."
