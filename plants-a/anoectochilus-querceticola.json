    "intro": "Anoectochilus querceticola, commonly known as the oak-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that resemble the texture of oak leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
