    "intro": "Andropogon auctus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces inflorescences composed of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Switchgrass is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies and along roadsides. It is also valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and as a potential biofuel crop."
