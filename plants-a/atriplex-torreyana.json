    "intro": "Atriplex torreyana, commonly known as Torrey's saltbush, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant thrives in arid and saline environments, making it well adapted to coastal and desert regions. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife in its native range."
