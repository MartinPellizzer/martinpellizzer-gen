    "intro": "Azorina, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are small, mat-forming plants with showy, pink or white flowers. These plants are typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in Mediterranean climates. Azorina species have slender stems and leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Their flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by bees and other pollinators."
