    "intro": "Amsinckia cuneata, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amsinckia cuneata is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
