    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha indica var. minima is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with disturbed habitats, such as roadside verges, waste areas, and forest edges. It thrives in warm climates with high humidity and is often seen in coastal regions. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha indica var. minima was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens and as a decorative plant. The variety is favored for its vibrant leaf colors and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
