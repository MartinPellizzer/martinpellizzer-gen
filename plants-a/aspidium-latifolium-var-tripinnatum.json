    "intro": "Aspidium latifolium var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial aquatic fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The fronds are typically tripinnate, meaning they have three levels of leaflets, giving the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
