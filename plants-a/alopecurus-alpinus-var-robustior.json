    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. robustior, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Alopecurus alpinus var. robustior is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
