    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata var. polycarpoides, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular trichomes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, which help prevent soil erosion in its natural habitat."
