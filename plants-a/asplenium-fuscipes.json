    "intro": "Asplenium fuscipes, commonly known as the black-footed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and woodland floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Asplenium fuscipes is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to thrive in humid, nutrient-rich substrates."
