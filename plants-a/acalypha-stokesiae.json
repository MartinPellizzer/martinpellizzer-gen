    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha stokesiae is primarily native to the island of St. Vincent in the Caribbean. It is found in the moist, shaded undergrowth of tropical rainforests. This species thrives in humid environments with high rainfall. It is commonly seen in the mountainous regions of the island. Unfortunately, its distribution is now limited due to habitat loss and environmental changes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha stokesiae was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions of the state. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, coastal dunes, and open woodlands. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in Hawaii."
