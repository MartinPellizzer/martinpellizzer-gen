    "intro": "Anemonastrum coelestinum, commonly known as the blue poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet petals that resemble those of the true poppies, though it belongs to the Montiaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anemonastrum coelestinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that replicate its natural habitat."
