    "intro": "Aconitum campylorrhynchum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple hooded flowers, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant features palmately divided leaves with sharply toothed margins, and it produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in temperate climates. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
