    "intro": "Armeria cephalotus, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to coastal landscapes. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. Armeria cephalotus is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
