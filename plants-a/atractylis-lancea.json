    "intro": "Atractylis lancea, commonly known as the lanceleaf eryngo, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in a single head. Atractylis lancea is often used in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
