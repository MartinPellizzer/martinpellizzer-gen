    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. linearilobum-atropurpureum, commonly known as the Crimson King maple, is a compact, slow-growing ornamental tree or shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that turn a brilliant crimson red in the autumn. The leaves are typically longer and narrower than those of the standard Acer palmatum, giving it a more refined appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its vibrant fall color and is often used in gardens for its ornamental value.",
