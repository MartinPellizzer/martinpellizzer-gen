    "intro": "Amyris ambrosiaca, commonly known as sweet amyris, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and clusters of small, fragrant yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous sap that has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds. Its bark and leaves contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, including antispasmodic and insecticidal effects. Amyris ambrosiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
