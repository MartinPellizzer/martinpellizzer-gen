    "intro": "Arenaria stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Arenaria stenopetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
