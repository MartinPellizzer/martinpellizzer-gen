    "intro": "Athyrium flexile, commonly known as the flexible chain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Dryopteridaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that often form a cascading effect, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Athyrium flexile is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
