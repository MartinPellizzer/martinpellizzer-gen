    "intro": "Avena lanuginosa, commonly known as the soft oat or velvet oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Avena lanuginosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has also been used in traditional herbal medicine."
