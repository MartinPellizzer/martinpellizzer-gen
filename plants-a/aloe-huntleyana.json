It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its ornamental value and ability to store water in its leaves make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
