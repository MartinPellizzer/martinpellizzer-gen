    "intro": "Asplenium azomanes, commonly known as the Madagascar spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow close to the ground. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium azomanes plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
