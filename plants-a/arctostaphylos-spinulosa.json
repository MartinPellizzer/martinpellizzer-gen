    "intro": "Arctostaphylos spinulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a small, leathery capsule that splits open to release seeds. Arctostaphylos spinulosa is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
