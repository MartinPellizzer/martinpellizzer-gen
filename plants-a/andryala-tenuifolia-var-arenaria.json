    "intro": "Andryala tenuifolia var. arenaria, commonly known as sand pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in coastal regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, round, greenish-brown fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
