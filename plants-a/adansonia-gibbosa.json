    "intro": "Adansonia gibbosa, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a striking deciduous tree native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has large, palmate leaves and produces yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a fibrous capsule that contains edible seeds, which are used in various traditional and modern culinary applications. The baobab is also culturally significant to the people of Madagascar and is often revered as a sacred tree.",
