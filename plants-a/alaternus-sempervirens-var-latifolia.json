    "intro": "Alaternus sempervirens var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf holly, is a variant of the holly species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green, with spiny margins. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its evergreen nature and structural form. This variety is well-suited for hedges or as a specimen plant in gardens."
