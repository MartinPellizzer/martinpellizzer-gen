    "intro": "Agastache micrantha, commonly known as narrow-leaved hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces spikes of violet to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a fuzzy texture. Agastache micrantha is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
