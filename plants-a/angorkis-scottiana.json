    "intro": "Angorkis scottiana, commonly known as the Scottish angorkis, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Scotland. It belongs to the angorkis family and is characterized by its distinctive, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late summer. Angorkis scottiana thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
