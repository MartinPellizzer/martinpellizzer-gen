    "intro": "Alnus tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly alder, is a deciduous tree native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish bark and small, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces catkins, which are its male flowers, and female flowers are borne in clusters. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found along stream banks and in wetlands. Alnus tomentosa plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
