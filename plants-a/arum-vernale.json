    "intro": "Arum vernale, commonly known as the spring arum, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is often covered in a dense mass of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. Arum vernale thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically blooms in early spring."
