    "intro": "Anoda triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed beggar's-tick, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the leaf axils. Its seeds are encased in a spiny, three-lobed capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Anoda triloba is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
