    "intro": "Arenaria cerastiifolia, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. Arenaria cerastiifolia plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy, ornamental qualities."
