It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure up to 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a rosette growth habit, with its leaves arranged in a tight, compact formation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Botanically, it is notable for its spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of its leaves."
