    "intro": "Arthrophyllum rubiginosum, commonly known as the red-stained fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often display a reddish or rusty hue, especially when young. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often valued in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
