    "intro": "Aster leucopappus, commonly known as the white pappus aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands. Its showy white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fluffy, white pappus that crowns each flower aids in seed dispersal by wind."
