    "intro": "Aegopodium, commonly known as bishop's weed, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it often grows in moist, disturbed soils. It contains various bioactive compounds, including coumarins, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. However, it can be toxic in large quantities and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
