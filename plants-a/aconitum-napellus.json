    "intro": "Aconitum napellus, commonly known as the Italian wolfsbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist, shaded environments such as woodland areas. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a rough texture. Aconitum napellus contains potent alkaloids, including aconitine, which make it highly toxic and potentially lethal if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often cultivated in controlled environments for its ornamental value rather than for medicinal use.",
