    "intro": "Allagopappus dichotomus subsp. viscosissimus, commonly known as the sticky goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branched stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a distinctive sticky coating on its leaves and stems, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in arid regions."
