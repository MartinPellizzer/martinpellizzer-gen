    "intro": "Ammannia senegalensis f. salsuginosa, commonly known as the saltbush ammannia, is a variant of the Ammannia senegalensis species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub with erect, branched stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Its small, pink to red flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland desert areas."
