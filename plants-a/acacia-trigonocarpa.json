    "intro": "Acacia trigonocarpa, commonly known as the three-angled wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate (three-leaf) compound leaves and yellow floral spikes. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia trigonocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia trigonocarpa is primarily native to Australia, specifically the arid and semi-arid regions of the central and western parts of the country. It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh, dry climate of its native habitat. The plant is known for its distinctive, triangular-shaped pods and is an important component of the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia trigonocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, often found in regions with seasonal rainfall. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in open woodlands, and in degraded habitats. This species is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to drought conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range, sometimes as an invasive species. It is valued for its hardy nature and potential use in soil stabilization and land rehabilitation projects."
