    "intro": "Arabis mollis subsp. graellsiiformis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of mountainous regions."
