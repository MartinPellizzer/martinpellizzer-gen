It typically thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in dry climates. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
