    "intro": "Ampelopsis heterophylla var. gentiliana, commonly known as the silver vine, is a climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible for birds and mammals. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers well-drained soil. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to climb trellises or walls."
