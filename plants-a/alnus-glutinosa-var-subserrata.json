    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. subserrata, commonly known as sticky alder or black alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind, and it has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near water bodies. This species is valued for its ecological benefits, including soil stabilization and habitat provision for wildlife."
