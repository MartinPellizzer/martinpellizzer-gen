    "intro": "Avenula praeusta subsp. pseudoviolacea, commonly known as the purple false oat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassland habitats and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
