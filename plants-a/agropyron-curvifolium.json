    "intro": "Agropyron curvifolium, commonly known as the curly leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron curvifolium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments. Its leaves are also utilized in traditional herbal medicine for their purported health benefits."
