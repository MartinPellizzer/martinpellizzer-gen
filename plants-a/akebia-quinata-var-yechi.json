    "intro": "Akebia quinata var. yechi, commonly known as the Japanese hop plant, is a deciduous climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a distinctive, often aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. Its stems are covered in tendrils and have a rough, bark-like surface. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
