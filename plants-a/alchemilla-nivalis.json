    "intro": "Alchemilla nivalis, commonly known as snow alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Alchemilla nivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
