    "intro": "Alpaminia trichocarpa, commonly known as the three-leaf alpaminia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. Alpaminia trichocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
