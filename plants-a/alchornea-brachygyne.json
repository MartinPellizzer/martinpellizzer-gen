    "intro": "Alchornea brachygyne, commonly known as the small-leaf alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its production of latex and unique floral structures. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a rough texture and small, clustered flowers that are often surrounded by bracts. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Alchornea brachygyne is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
