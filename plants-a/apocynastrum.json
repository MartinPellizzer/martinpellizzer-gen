    "intro": "Apocynastrum, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. They typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers that are often pink, purple, or white. Apocynastrum species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and others for their ecological importance to certain pollinators."
