    "intro": "Athyrium angustipinna, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly serrated edge. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots throughout the growing season. The fronds are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its graceful appearance."
