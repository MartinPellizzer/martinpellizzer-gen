    "intro": "Acrostichum heliconiifolium, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a large, terrestrial fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions, which is a unique botanical feature. The plant plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability.",
