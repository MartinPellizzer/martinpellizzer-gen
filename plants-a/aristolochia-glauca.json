It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-blue in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, somewhat musky fragrance. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. However, it contains toxic compounds and is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
