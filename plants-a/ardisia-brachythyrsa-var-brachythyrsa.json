    "intro": "Ardisia brachythyrsa var. brachythyrsa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beautyberry, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it a distinct appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters, followed by clusters of bright blue berries that are highly ornamental. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and showy fruit. The berries are edible but not commonly consumed by humans due to their tart flavor."
