    "intro": "Agonis spathulata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeywood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody capsules that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and Mediterranean climates. Agonis spathulata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
