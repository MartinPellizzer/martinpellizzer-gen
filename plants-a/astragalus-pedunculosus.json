It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
