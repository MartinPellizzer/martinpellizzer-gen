    "intro": "Allomorphia griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's allomorph, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
