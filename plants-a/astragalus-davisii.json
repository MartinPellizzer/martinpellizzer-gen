    "intro": "Astragalus davisii, commonly known as Davis' milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus davisii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
