    "intro": "Asphodelus infestus, commonly known as the common asphodel, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall spikes of pale yellow to orange flowers in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Asphodelus infestus is known for its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
