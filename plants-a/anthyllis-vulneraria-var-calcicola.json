    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone everlasting, is a flowering plant native to calcareous grasslands and rocky soils in Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by pollinators such as bees. It has adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, alkaline soils, making it a valuable component of dry, open habitats. Its conservation status is of concern due to habitat loss and fragmentation."
