    "intro": "Aristida humbertii, commonly known as Humbert's threeawn, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Aristida humbertii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
