    "intro": "Asplenium platyneuron var. platyneuron, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a perennial fern species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or crevices. The plant has a compact, clump-forming growth habit with dark green, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
