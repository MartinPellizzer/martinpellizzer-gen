    "intro": "Agrostis grandis, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted inflorescences that resemble small, fluffy plumes. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and roadside areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, while its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively. Agrostis grandis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
