    "intro": "Astragalus pseudoamabilis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus pseudoamabilis is often found in sagebrush steppe and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
