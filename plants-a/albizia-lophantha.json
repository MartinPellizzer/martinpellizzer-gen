    "intro": "Albizia lophantha, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Albizia lophantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
