    "intro": "Astragalus squalidus, commonly known as the scaly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus squalidus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
