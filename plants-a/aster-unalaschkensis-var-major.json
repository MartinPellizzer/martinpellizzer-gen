    "intro": "Aster unalaschkensis var. major, commonly known as the Alaska aster, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, tundra-like habitats and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, violet-blue flower heads. The plant produces numerous small, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, harsh climate. This species is an important component of Arctic ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and soil stability in its native range."
