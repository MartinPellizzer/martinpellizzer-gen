    "intro": "Arctium cataonicum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with rough, serrated edges and a thick, hairy stem. Its most notable feature is the spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium cataonicum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, thriving in temperate climates."
