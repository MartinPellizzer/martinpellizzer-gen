    "intro": "Alisma apetalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 inch wide, arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, emerging on tall, slender stalks above the water. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Alisma apetalum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
