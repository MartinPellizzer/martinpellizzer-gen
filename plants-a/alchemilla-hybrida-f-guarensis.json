The plant features broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the spring and early summer. This cultivar is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, moist soils in partial shade."
