    "intro": "Acacia striatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Acacia striatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia striatifolia is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions of the state. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of Queensland. Its distribution is largely confined to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia striatifolia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for windbreaks and soil stabilization due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness. It is valued for its ability to provide shade and habitat for local wildlife."
