    "intro": "Asplenium pseudopraemorsum, commonly known as the false death's-head fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called an indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium pseudopraemorsum is often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, showcasing its adaptability to various microhabitats."
