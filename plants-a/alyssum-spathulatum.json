    "intro": "Alyssum spathulatum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant. Alyssum spathulatum is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
