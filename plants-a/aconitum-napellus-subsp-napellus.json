    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. napellus, commonly known as the European monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers and palmate leaves. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its tall, sparsely branched stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow environments. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids such as aconitine.",
