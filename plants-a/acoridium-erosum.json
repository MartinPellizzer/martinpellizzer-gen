    "intro": "Acoridium erosum, commonly known as the slender swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often near streams or marshes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in soft substrates. Acoridium erosum plays a role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates.",
