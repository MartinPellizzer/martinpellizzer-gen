    "intro": "Andriana marojejyensis, commonly known as the Marojejy starfish flower, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Marojejy National Park in Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes plants such as the cashew and poison ivy. The plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and yellow. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
