    "intro": "Ardisia listeri, commonly known as the Florida flamewood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a faintly aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
