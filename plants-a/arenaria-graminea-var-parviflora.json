    "intro": "Arenaria graminea var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy habitats. It features compact, mat-forming growth with tiny, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in harsh conditions."
