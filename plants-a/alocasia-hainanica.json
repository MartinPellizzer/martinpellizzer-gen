It features large, arrow-shaped leaves with a deep green color and a waxy texture. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a broad, upright stem. Its foliage is characterized by prominent veins and a slightly pointed tip, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor ornamental gardening. Alocasia hainanica thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
