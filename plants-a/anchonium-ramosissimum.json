    "intro": "Anchonium ramosissimum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, pinkish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature. Anchonium ramosissimum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
