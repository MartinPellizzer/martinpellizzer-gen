    "intro": "Agrostis stolonizans, commonly known as Bermuda grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons and rhizomes that allow it to spread rapidly and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in a variety of soil types, making it a common lawn and erosion control plant. Its ability to regenerate from rhizomes makes it resilient to mowing and environmental stress."
