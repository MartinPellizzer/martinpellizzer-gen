    "intro": "Astragalus rhizanthus subsp. rhizanthus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid regions of central Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
