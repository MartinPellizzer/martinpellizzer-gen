This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in areas with high humidity and well-drained soil. Acalypha volkensii is often associated with forested or wooded habitats. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of East and Central Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha volkensii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly used in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. The plant has been introduced to several countries outside its native range, including parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to its naturalization in some areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced."
