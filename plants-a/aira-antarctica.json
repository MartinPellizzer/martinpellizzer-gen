    "intro": "Aira antarctica, commonly known as Antarctic hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the cold regions of the Southern Hemisphere. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in harsh environments such as Antarctica, South America, and New Zealand. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers. Its ability to survive in extreme conditions is due to its dense root system and low water requirements. Botanically, it is classified within the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its resilience to cold and nutrient-poor soils."
