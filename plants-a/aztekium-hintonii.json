    "intro": "Aztekium hintonii, commonly known as the Hinton's aztekium, is a small, globular cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescence covering its spherical stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is a slow-growing species that requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
