    "intro": "Aphania microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Aphania microcarpa is also known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
