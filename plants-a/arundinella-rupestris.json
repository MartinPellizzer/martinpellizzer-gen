    "intro": "Arundinella rupestris, commonly known as the rock reed, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Arundinella rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
