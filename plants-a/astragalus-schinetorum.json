    "intro": "Astragalus schinetorum, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid regions."
