    "intro": "Aster macrophyllus var. apricensis, commonly known as the Alpine aster, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at high altitudes. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
