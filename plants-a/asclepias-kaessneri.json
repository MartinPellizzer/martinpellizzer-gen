It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, clustered flowers that range from pink to red. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Asclepias and contains latex compounds. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged oppositely along the stems. Asclepias kaessneri plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
