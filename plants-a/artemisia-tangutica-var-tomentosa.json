    "intro": "Artemisia tangutica var. tomentosa, commonly known as the Tangut wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clustered inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
