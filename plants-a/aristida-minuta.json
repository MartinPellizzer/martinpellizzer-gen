    "intro": "Aristida minuta, commonly known as dwarf dropseed, is a low-growing grass species native to North America. It features slender, grass-like blades that are typically less than 30 centimeters tall, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, and is drought-tolerant once established. Aristida minuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
