    "intro": "Astragalus coronilla subsp. semnanicus, commonly known as the Persian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a taproot system that allows it to access deep water sources, making it resilient in harsh environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss through transpiration."
