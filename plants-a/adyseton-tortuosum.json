    "intro": "Adyseton tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted wood fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its intricate, branched fronds that give it a distinctive and often whimsical appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rhizome is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. The fronds are biennial, with the fertile fronds appearing in the second year of growth."
