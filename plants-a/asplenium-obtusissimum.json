    "intro": "Asplenium obtusissimum, commonly known as the broad-leaved spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often densely covered with small, rounded teeth. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or soil banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, which are often protected by a indusium. Asplenium obtusissimum is a relatively small fern, usually reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters."
