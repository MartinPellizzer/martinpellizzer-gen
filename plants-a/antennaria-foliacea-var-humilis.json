    "intro": "Antennaria foliacea var. humilis, commonly known as the low sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, often succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions. Its structure and adaptations make it well-suited for survival in cold, exposed habitats."
