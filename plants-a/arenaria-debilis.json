    "intro": "Arenaria debilis, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate drought make it well-suited for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
