    "intro": "Avena distans, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Avena distans is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks or in open woodlands. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
