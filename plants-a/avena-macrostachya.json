    "intro": "Avena macrostachya, commonly known as the giant oat, is a tall perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and large, feathery inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in panicles, which are often adorned with long, drooping bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Avena macrostachya is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
