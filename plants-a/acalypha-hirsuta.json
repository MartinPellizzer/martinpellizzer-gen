    "intro": "Acalypha hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy spurge or red-rooted spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its milky sap and diverse morphological features. The plant typically grows as an erect herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its flowers are small and clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hirsuta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed or secondary growth areas. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Acalypha hirsuta is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hirsuta was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as landscaping and horticultural trade. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, abandoned fields, and urban environments. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading rapidly due to its ability to produce\u5927\u91cf seeds. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. However, it is generally not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
