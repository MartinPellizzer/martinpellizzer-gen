    "intro": "Amylocarpus pulcher, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding its survival in fluctuating environmental conditions. Its roots are fibrous and play a crucial role in anchoring the plant and absorbing moisture from the soil. Amylocarpus pulcher thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
