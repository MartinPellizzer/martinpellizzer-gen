    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. remotissimum, commonly known as the remote spinulose water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, spinulose pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along the edges of streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it a common sight in swampy habitats."
