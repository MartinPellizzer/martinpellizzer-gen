    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum var. arvaticum, commonly known as desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dryland landscapes."
