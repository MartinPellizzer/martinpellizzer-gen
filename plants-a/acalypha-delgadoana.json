It is commonly observed in states such as Chihuahua and Durango. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the southwestern part of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha delgadoana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in certain regions of the country. The plant is considered a potential weed due to its ability to spread through seeds and vegetative growth. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive potential has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
