    "intro": "Araucaria araucana, commonly known as the Andes pine, is a coniferous tree native to the southern Andes. It is characterized by its distinctive Christmas-tree-like shape and long, drooping cones. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in spirals around the stem. It produces edible seeds called pine nuts, which have been used by indigenous peoples for centuries. Araucaria araucana is also known for its slow growth and longevity, with some specimens living over 1,000 years."
