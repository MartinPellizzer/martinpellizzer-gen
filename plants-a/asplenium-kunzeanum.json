    "intro": "Asplenium kunzeanum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium kunzeanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
