    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus pubescens is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the country, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen growing along the edges of forests or in open, sunny areas. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and mild, wet winters. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in other parts of the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus pubescens was mainly introduced to areas where its ornamental value and adaptability make it suitable for landscaping and garden design. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in coastal and urban environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to its spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Due to its aesthetic appeal, it is often used in horticulture and as a decorative element in public spaces."
