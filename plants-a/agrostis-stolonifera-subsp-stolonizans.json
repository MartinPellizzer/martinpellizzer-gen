    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. stolonizans, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features tufted, dark green foliage with slender, rhizomatous growth that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
