It features silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are aromatic and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, rounded clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and aromatic properties."
