It features basal rosettes of hairy, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its compact form and delicate floral display."
