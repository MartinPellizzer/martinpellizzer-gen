    "intro": "Acacia lirellata subsp. lirellata, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that appear in globular heads. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender growth habit compared to other acacia species.",

This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It is typically found in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is closely associated with the specific climatic and soil conditions of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lirellata subsp. lirellata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant is now considered a weed in some areas of New Zealand, posing a threat to biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and control its impact on local ecosystems."
