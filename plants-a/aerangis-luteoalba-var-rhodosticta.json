    "intro": "Aerangis luteoalba var. rhodosticta, commonly known as the golden white orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and white petals, which are often adorned with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical environments. Its flowers bloom in clusters, emitting a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
