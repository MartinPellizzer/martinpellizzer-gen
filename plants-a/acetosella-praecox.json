    "intro": "Acetosella praecox, commonly known as early wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Acetosella praecox is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.",
