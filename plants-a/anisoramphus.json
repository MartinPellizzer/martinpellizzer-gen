    "intro": "Anisoramphus, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often display a range of colors, including pink, purple, and white. The leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Anisoramphus species are often used in native plant gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
