It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
