    "intro": "Acrostichum alatum f. minutum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf horse-tail, is a fern that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is a compact, low-growing plant with narrow, linear leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces sporangia in clusters along the undersides of its leaves, a characteristic feature of ferns. This fern is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices.",
