    "intro": "Astilbe thunbergii var. obtusata, commonly known as the Japanese feather reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, plume-like panicles of pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy beneath. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its soft, feathery appearance and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
