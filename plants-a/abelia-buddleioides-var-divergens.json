    "intro": "Abelia buddleioides var. divergens, commonly known as the Chinese abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of pink and white. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, red berries in the fall. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia buddleioides var. divergens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies in these regions. This variety thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with coastal and inland wetland habitats. It is a hardy shrub that plays an important ecological role in its native environment. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other areas with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia buddleioides var. divergens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, showy flowers and compact growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is particularly favored in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils. Its introduction has expanded its geographic range beyond its native habitat. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native areas."
