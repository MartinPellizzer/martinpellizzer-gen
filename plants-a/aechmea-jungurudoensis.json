    "intro": "Aechmea jungurudoensis, commonly known as the Jungurudo bromeliad, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. Aechmea jungurudoensis is well adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
