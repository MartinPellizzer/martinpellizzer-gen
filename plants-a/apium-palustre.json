    "intro": "Apium palustre, commonly known as marsh celery, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic leaves and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies in marshes and along riverbanks. Its hollow, ridged stems and finely divided leaves are adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Marsh celery is also valued for its edible leaves and roots, which have been used in traditional cuisine and herbal medicine."
