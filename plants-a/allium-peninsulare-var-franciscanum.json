It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical bulbils that are often used for propagation. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its flowers are typically lavender to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
