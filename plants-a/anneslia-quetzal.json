It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often resembling the plumage of the resplendent quetzal bird. The plant belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is known for its delicate, bell-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. Anneslia quetzal thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests.
