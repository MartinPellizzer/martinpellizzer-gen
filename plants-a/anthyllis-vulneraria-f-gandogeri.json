    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. gandogeri, commonly known as the Gandogeri sweet clover, is a rare and specialized plant species within the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is adapted to grow in specific ecological niches, often found in dry, calcareous soils. Its morphology includes trifoliate leaves and a compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in certain regions."
