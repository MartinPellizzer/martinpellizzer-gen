    "intro": "Agapetes megacarpa var. lohitensis, commonly known as the Lohit giant bellflower, is a rare and endemic species found in the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while its fruit is a large, fleshy capsule that contains numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
