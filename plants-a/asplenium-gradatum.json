    "intro": "Asplenium gradatum, commonly known as the graduated spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. Its fronds are usually arranged in a spiral pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Asplenium gradatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
