    "intro": "Avena flavescens var. depauperata, commonly known as the slender oat, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant."
