    "intro": "Armeria maritima f. occasiana, commonly known as the coastal thrift or sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for maritime environments and ecological restoration projects."
