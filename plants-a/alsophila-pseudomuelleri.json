    "intro": "Alsophila pseudomuelleri, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its fronds are typically bright green and can grow up to several meters in length. Alsophila pseudomuelleri is often found in humid, shaded environments such as tropical rainforests."
