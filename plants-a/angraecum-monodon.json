    "intro": "Angraecum monodon, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, white or pale pink petals that resemble stars, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are adapted for pollination by moths, particularly the giant hawk-moth. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Angraecum monodon is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments."
