It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in wetland and marshy environments, often found near water bodies. Its leaves are arrow-shaped, which contributes to its common name, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Actephila anthelminthica has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its potential antiparasitic properties.",
