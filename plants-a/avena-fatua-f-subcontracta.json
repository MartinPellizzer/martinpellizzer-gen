    "intro": "Avena fatua f. subcontracta, commonly known as a variant of wild oat, is a grass species characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, each with a single glume and a lemma. Its seeds are small and have a distinctive shape, aiding in wind dispersal. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability and is considered a weed in many cultivated environments."
