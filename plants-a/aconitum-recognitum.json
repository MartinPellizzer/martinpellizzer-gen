    "intro": "Aconitum recognitum, commonly known as the recognized aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are covered in a dense layer of hairs. Aconitum recognitum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
