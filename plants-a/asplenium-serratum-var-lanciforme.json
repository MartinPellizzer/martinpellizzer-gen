    "intro": "Asplenium serratum var. lanciforme, commonly known as the lance-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the serrated maidenhair fern native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
