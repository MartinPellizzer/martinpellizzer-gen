    "intro": "Amblystigma cionophorum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cionophorum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The plant features slender stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small white to pale yellow flowers appear in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
