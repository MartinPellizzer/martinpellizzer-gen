    "intro": "Alchemilla bourgeaui, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive waxy coating, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Alchemilla bourgeaui is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
