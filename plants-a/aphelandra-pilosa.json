    "intro": "Aphelandra pilosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf torch plant, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. These flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. Aphelandra pilosa thrives in warm, humid environments and is often grown as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens."
