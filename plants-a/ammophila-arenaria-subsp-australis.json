    "intro": "Ammophila arenaria subsp. australis, commonly known as the Australian beach grass, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Its growth is often limited by salt spray and wind exposure, making it a key species in coastal ecosystems."
