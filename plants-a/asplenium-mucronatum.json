    "intro": "Asplenium mucronatum, commonly known as the blunt-sheath spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and linear, often hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are usually located near the tips of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium mucronatum is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
