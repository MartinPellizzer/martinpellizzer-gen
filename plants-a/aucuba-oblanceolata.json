    "intro": "Aucuba oblanceolata, commonly known as the Japanese aucuba, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features glossy, dark green, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often adorned with yellow or white variegation. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its persistent foliage and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
