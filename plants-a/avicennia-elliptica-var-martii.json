    "intro": "Avicennia elliptica var. martii, commonly known as the mangrove shrub, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and tidal environments. It thrives in coastal areas where it tolerates high salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has aerial roots, known as pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial ecosystems."
