    "intro": "Aspidium malayense, commonly known as the Malay water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, slender fronds that are typically submerged or floating, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Aspidium malayense plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
