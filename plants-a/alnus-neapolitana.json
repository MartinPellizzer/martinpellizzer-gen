    "intro": "Alnus neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples alder, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves that are alternate and pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water sources. Alnus neapolitana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to improve soil conditions through nitrogen fixation."
