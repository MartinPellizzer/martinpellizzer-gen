    "intro": "Albizia petersiana subsp. evansii, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silky to the touch due to a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna or woodland habitats. Albizia petersiana subsp. evansii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
