    "intro": "Acer robustum, commonly known as the robust maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a dense, rounded canopy. Acer robustum prefers well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest ecosystems.",
