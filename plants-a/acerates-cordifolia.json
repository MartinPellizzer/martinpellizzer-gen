    "intro": "Acerates cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and have a heart-shaped base, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.",
