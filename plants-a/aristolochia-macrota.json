    "intro": "Aristolochia macrota, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces showy, fragrant blossoms that attract insects, particularly flies, which aid in pollination. Its fruit is a smooth, inflated capsule that splits open to release small, kidney-shaped seeds. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
