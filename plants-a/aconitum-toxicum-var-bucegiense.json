It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
