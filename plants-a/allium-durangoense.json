    "intro": "Allium durangoense, commonly known as the Durango onion, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, dry climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
