    "intro": "Antennaria concinna, commonly known as the slender mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, elongated stems and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually linear or narrowly elliptic, and the plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Antennaria concinna is also known for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat."
