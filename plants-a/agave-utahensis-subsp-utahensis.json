    "intro": "Agave utahensis subsp. utahensis, commonly known as Utah agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Utah and parts of Arizona. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to greenish flowers. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden environments."
