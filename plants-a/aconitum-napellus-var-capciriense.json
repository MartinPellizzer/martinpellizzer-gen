    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. capciriense, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that resemble a bishop's mitre, with spade-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant grows up to 1.5 meters tall and prefers well-drained, moist soils in partial shade. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. Its ornamental value is often balanced by its potential danger to livestock and humans.",
