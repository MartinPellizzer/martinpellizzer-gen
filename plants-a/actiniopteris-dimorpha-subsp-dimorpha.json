    "intro": "Actiniopteris dimorpha subsp. dimorpha, commonly known as the two-form maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The subsp. dimorpha is notable for its distinct morphological variation compared to other subspecies within the Actiniopteris genus.",
