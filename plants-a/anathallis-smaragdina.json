    "intro": "Anathallis smaragdina, commonly known as the emerald torch orchid, is a species of orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking greenish-yellow flowers that resemble a torch, with prominent sepals and petals. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance, which helps attract specific pollinators such as bees and moths. Anathallis smaragdina is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
