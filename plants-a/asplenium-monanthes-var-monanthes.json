    "intro": "Asplenium monanthes var. monanthes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia found on the underside of the fronds. This fern is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
