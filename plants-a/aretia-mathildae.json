    "intro": "Aretia mathildae, commonly known as the Mathilde's aretia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces small, daisy-like blooms in shades of white and pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aretia mathildae is considered a species of conservation concern."
