    "intro": "Appendicularia, commonly known as larvaceans, are small, free-swimming marine invertebrates belonging to the class Appendicularia. They are characterized by their transparent, gelatinous bodies and the presence of a mucous house, which they construct and continuously repair. These organisms are filter feeders, using their appendages to capture planktonic particles from the water. Appendicularia play an important role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and serving as a food source for larger organisms. Their unique morphology and ecological significance make them a fascinating subject in marine biology."
