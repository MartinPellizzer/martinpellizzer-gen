    "intro": "Aristolochia tournefortii, commonly known as the Turk's Cap or Turkish Cap, is a climbing vine native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant is known for its complex morphology, including a unique corolla that resembles a cap, and it produces small, green berries that mature to a dark purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. The genus Aristolochia contains many species with similar characteristics, some of which are used in traditional medicine, though many are toxic."
