    "intro": "Ananas bracamorensis, commonly known as the Bocai\u00fava pineapple, is a tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of stiff, spiny leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces a single, edible fruit that is smaller and more acidic than the common pineapple. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
