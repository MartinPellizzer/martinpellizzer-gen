    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. tenuis, commonly known as the dwarf almond. This variant is a smaller, compact form of the common almond, characterized by its shorter branches and reduced size compared to the standard variety. It produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible nuts that are typically harvested in the fall. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
