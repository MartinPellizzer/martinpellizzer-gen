    "intro": "Aspalathus petersonii, commonly known as the Peterson's bushveld pea, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for dry, rocky environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Aspalathus petersonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
