It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its dense, fibrous foliage and woody stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of spherical, woody fruits. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, contributing to its overall appearance. Agrostophyllum globigerum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or forested areas."
