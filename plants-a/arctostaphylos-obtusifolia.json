    "intro": "Arctostaphylos obtusifolia, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and broad, leathery leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous regions. The Pacific madrone is also notable for its ability to regenerate from seed and its role in supporting local wildlife."
