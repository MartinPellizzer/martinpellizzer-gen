    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. petricola, commonly known as the rock Arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and delicate floral display."
