    "intro": "Amelanchier canadensis var. stolonifera, commonly known as the Allegheny serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which involves horizontal stems that can root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense thickets. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn vibrant shades of red or orange in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sun."
