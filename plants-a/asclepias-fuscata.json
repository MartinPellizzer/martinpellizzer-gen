    "intro": "Asclepias fuscata, commonly known as the dusky milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, fluffy seeds with silky parachutes. It is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias fuscata thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
