    "intro": "Anthurium angustilaminatum var. crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaf anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a glossy, deep green surface. The plant produces vibrant spadices, which are often red or orange, surrounded by showy, white to cream-colored spatula-shaped bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care."
