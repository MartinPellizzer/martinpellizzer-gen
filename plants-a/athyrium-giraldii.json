    "intro": "Athyrium giraldii, commonly known as the Giraldii lady fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium giraldii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, cool climates."
