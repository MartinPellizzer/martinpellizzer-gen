    "intro": "Aconitum rostratum var. judenbergense, commonly known as the Judenberg's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its roots are tuberous, typical of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
