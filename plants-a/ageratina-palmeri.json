    "intro": "Ageratina palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, blue to purple flower heads that resemble those of the aster family. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert regions. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture. Ageratina palmeri is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
