    "intro": "Astragalus praesignis, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as grasslands and slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Astragalus praesignis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for pollinators."
