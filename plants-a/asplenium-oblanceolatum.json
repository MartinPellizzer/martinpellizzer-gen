    "intro": "Asplenium oblanceolatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor, forming dense mats. The fronds are evergreen, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
