    "intro": "Asplenium verecundum, commonly known as the shy fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often curl inward, giving it a reclusive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under forest canopies, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium verecundum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of care in appropriate conditions."
