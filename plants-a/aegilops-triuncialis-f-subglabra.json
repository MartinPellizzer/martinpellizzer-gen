    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis f. subglabra, commonly known as the smooth spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, smooth lemmaless florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is often found in naturalized populations in areas with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
