    "intro": "Arenaria xerophila, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, often blue or silver-colored leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and deep root system enable it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Arenaria xerophila is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats."
