    "intro": "Andryala ragusina subsp. spatrioides, commonly known as the Sicilian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
