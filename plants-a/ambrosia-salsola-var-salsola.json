    "intro": "Ambrosia salsola var. salsola, commonly known as Russian thistle, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Eurasia. It features a branching structure with spiny stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in new regions. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in disturbed soils across the globe."
