It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically green with vibrant red, pink, and orange markings, creating a colorful display. The plant produces tall flower spikes with showy, spathaceous bracts that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity to flourish."
