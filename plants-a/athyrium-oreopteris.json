    "intro": "Athyrium oreopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Athyriaceae family. Athyrium oreopteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
