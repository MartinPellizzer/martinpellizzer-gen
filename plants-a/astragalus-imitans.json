It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Astragalus imitans plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, though it is not widely cultivated."
