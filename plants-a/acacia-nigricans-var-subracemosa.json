    "intro": "Acacia nigricans var. subracemosa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemose inflorescences, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia nigricans var. subracemosa is primarily native to the northern and eastern regions of Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. It thrives in a variety of habitats such as coastal dunes, sandy soils, and open woodlands. This variant is commonly found in areas with a warm, dry climate and is often associated with coastal and inland sand plains. It is well adapted to withstand drought and salty conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nigricans var. subracemosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low to moderate rainfall. This plant thrives in full sun and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is largely due to human activity and its adaptability to different environmental conditions."
