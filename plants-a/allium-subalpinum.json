    "intro": "Allium subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine garlic, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears small, white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbous underground stem, or bulb, is used in traditional medicine and has a mild garlic-like aroma. Allium subalpinum thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
