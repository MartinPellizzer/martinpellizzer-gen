    "intro": "Aristida angolensis, commonly known as Angolan threeawn, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and spikelets that are typically three- to four-toothed. The plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Aristida angolensis is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its resilience to drought."
