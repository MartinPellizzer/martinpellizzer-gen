    "intro": "Austrobaeckea uncinella, commonly known as the Australian ironwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes flaky with age. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture with a distinctive aromatic scent. Austrobaeckea uncinella is valued for its hard, heavy wood and is often used in traditional crafts and as a source of tannins."
