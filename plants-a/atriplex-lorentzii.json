    "intro": "Atriplex lorentzii, commonly known as Lorentz's saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often coated with a white waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Atriplex lorentzii is an important plant for stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
