    "intro": "Asplenium heterogenum, commonly known as the heterogamous spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with separate male and female gametophytes, a feature that distinguishes it from many other fern species. Its spores are released from specialized structures called soruses, which are located on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium heterogenum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
