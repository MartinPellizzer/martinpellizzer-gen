    "intro": "Asclepias graminifolia, commonly known as the grassleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds attached to silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. Asclepias graminifolia is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing a vital food source for their larvae."
