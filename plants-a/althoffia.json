    "intro": "Althoffia, commonly known as the alpine snowbell, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white or blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Althoffia has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, edible berries that are not commonly consumed by humans. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and hardy species adapted to cold climates."
