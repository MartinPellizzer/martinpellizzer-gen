It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh, arid conditions. Acrodon leptophyllus is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures.",
