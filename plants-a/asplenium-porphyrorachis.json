    "intro": "Asplenium porphyrorachis, commonly known as the purple-veined spleenwort, is a member of the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive purple-tinged venation pattern. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it thrives in cool, moist climates. Asplenium porphyrorachis is often found in montane and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of forest ecosystems."
