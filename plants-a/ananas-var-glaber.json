    "intro": "Ananas var. glaber, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces a spiky, fleshy fruit that develops from the central stem after flowering. The fruit is prized for its sweet, aromatic flesh and is widely cultivated for both commercial and culinary use. Botanically, it belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is a member of the genus Ananas."
