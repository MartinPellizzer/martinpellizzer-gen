    "intro": "Acer italum f. keckianum, commonly known as the Keck's maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Italian maple. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring palmately lobed leaves with a vibrant green color during the growing season. The plant produces small, red flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued by horticulturists and botanists alike.",
