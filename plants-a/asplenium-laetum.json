    "intro": "Asplenium laetum, commonly known as the common shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium laetum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
