    "intro": "Anemone geum subsp. ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are hairy and upright. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and early blooming period."
