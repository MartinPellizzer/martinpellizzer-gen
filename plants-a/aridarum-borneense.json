    "intro": "Aridarum borneense, commonly known as the Bornean sand orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, sand-like appearance, with small, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the dry season. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires high humidity and indirect sunlight. Its specialized adaptations allow it to survive in the nutrient-poor environments of the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts in its native region."
