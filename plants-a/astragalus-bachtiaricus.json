    "intro": "Astragalus bachtiaricus, commonly known as the Bachtiari milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves that are adapted to thrive in dry, sandy environments. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many nitrogen-fixing species, contributing to soil fertility. It is often found in steppes and semi-deserts, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
