    "intro": "Aeridium, commonly known as the air orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. Aeridium species typically have thin, wiry stems and produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. Their unique ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments makes them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
