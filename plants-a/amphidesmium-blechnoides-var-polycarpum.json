    "intro": "Amphidesmium blechnoides var. polycarpum, commonly known as the Polycarpum fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, compact fern with a creeping rhizome and dense, lance-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. This variety is characterized by its ability to produce multiple sporangia, hence the name \"polycarpum.\" It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth."
