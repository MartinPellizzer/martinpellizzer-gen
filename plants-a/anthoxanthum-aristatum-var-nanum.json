    "intro": "Anthoxanthum aristatum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf oatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats, with small, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces delicate, spike-like inflorescences bearing small, pale-yellow to brownish flowers, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and ability to form attractive ground cover."
