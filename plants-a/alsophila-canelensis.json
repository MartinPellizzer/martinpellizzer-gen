    "intro": "Alsophila canelensis, commonly known as the Canel Islands tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments, often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of the trunk, while the fronds are used for photosynthesis. Alsophila canelensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
