    "intro": "Atractocarpa olyriformis, commonly known as the yellow sand dollar, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Atractocarpa olyriformis is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
