    "intro": "Astrocaryum standleyanum var. calimense, commonly known as the Calimense palm, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is a medium-sized palm characterized by its slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by elongated, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
