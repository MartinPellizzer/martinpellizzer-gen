    "intro": "Andrachne hainanensis var. nummulariifolia, commonly known as the Hainan sandwort, is a rare flowering plant native to the Hainan Island in China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that resemble coins. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the humid subtropical climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
