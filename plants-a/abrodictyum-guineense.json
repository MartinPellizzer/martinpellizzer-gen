It is commonly found in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodland and grassland habitats, often near water sources. It is an important species in local ecosystems, supporting various pollinators and wildlife. Its natural range extends across parts of West and Central Africa, where it plays a role in traditional medicine and cultural practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum guineense was mainly introduced to new environments due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. This plant has been reported in several countries, including parts of Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond controlled areas."
