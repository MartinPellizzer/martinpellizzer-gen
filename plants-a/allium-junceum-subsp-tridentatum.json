    "intro": "Allium junceum subsp. tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true bulbs, though they are more accurately classified as bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like scent, it is cultivated for both garden aesthetics and culinary use."
