    "intro": "Argythamnia sitiens, commonly known as the desert gumweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Argythamnia sitiens is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral ecosystems."
