    "intro": "Astragalus yukonis, commonly known as Yukon milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods that contain several small, lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Astragalus yukonis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its arctic and subarctic environments."
