    "intro": "Alchemilla virginea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady\u2019s mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Alchemilla virginea is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
