It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, low-nutrient soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
