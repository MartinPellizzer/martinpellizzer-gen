    "intro": "Astragalus behboudii, commonly known as the Behboudii milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
