    "intro": "Asplenium furcatum var. tripinnatum, commonly known as the three-pinnate spleenwort, is a fern native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a triangular pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a kidney-shaped indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
