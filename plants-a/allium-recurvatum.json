    "intro": "Allium recurvatum, commonly known as the bent-neck garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a cluster of small, white or pale purple flowers. Its bulbous underground stem, or bulb, is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary ingredient. Allium recurvatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for alpine gardens."
