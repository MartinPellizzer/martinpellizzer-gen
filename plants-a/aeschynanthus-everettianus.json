    "intro": "Aeschynanthus everettianus, commonly known as the everettian waxflower, is a flowering plant native to the humid lowland forests of western Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its warm, moist environment. Aeschynanthus everttianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated as a houseplant in tropical and subtropical regions."
