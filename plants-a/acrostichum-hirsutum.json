It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, compound fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Its fronds are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it the common name \"hairy brake fern.\" The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds.",
