    "intro": "Acinodendron pustulatum, commonly known as the blisterleaf tree, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often have a blistery or pustular texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that is capsule-like in structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
