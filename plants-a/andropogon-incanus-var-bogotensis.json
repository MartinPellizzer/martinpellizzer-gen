    "intro": "Andropogon incanus var. bogotensis, commonly known as the Bogot\u00e1 hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous grasslands and wetlands. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
