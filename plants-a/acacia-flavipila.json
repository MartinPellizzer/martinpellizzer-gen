    "intro": "Acacia flavipila, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements and are a symbol of Australian identity. Acacia flavipila is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia flavipila is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the northern parts of Victoria. It is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands, often on sandy or rocky soils. This species thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is also occasionally seen in coastal areas and on the edges of heathlands. Acacia flavipila plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flavipila was mainly introduced to areas with sandy soils and arid climates, where it thrives in full sun. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has also been noted in some parts of Southeast Asia for ecological restoration projects. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
