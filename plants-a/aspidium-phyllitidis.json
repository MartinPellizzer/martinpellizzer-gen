    "intro": "Aspidium phyllitidis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often bright green and have a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is native to regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus. Aspidium phyllitidis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
