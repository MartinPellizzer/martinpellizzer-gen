    "intro": "Anteriorchis sancta, commonly known as the sacred mistflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, white, mist-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, elongated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in cool, humid conditions and is often found growing in rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in both botanical research and traditional medicine."
