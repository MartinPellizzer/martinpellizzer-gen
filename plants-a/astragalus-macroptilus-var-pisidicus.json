    "intro": "Astragalus macroptilus var. pisidicus, commonly known as the Crimean milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of southern Ukraine and Crimea. It features slender, ascending stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange pea-like flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is robust and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
