    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum var. corunnense, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its dark, velvety fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a soft texture that distinguishes it from other fern species. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
