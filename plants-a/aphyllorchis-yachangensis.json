    "intro": "Aphyllorchis yachangensis, commonly known as the Yachang orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it receives indirect sunlight. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive coloration that varies from white to pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
