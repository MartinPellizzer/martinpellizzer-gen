    "intro": "Aspidium leucopis, commonly known as the white-veined shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of white, silky hair. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. Aspidium leucopis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
