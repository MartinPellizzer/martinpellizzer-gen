    "intro": "Alisma montanum, commonly known as mountain arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, streambanks, and moist meadows, thriving in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. The plant has slender, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small white or pale yellow flowers appear in late summer, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Alisma montanum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
