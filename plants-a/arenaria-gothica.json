    "intro": "Arenaria gothica, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions make it a resilient species in high-altitude ecosystems. The leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention in arid environments."
