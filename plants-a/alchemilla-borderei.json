    "intro": "Alchemilla borderei, commonly known as the border alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Alchemilla borderei is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
