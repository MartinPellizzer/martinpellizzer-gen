    "intro": "Allium gaditanum var. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbiferous garlic. This plant is a perennial species native to the Iberian Peninsula, characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. It produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by spherical, bulbous structures that resemble miniature garlic bulbs. The plant is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or arid soils. Its botanical features make it a unique and interesting subject for study in Mediterranean botany."
