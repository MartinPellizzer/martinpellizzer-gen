    "intro": "Allium oreoprasum, commonly known as wild leek or mountain garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers in early summer, followed by small, pale blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Allium oreoprasum is valued for its mild garlic-like flavor and is used in some traditional cuisines."
