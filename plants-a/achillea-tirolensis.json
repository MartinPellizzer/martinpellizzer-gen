    "intro": "Achillea tirolensis, commonly known as Alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It features a compact growth habit with silver-gray, finely divided leaves and flat, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant produces numerous small, composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Achillea tirolensis is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value.",
