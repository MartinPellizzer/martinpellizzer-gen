    "intro": "Anthurium longipes, commonly known as the long-spurred anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking, elongated spathes that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces vividly colored spathes, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which serve to attract pollinators. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Anthurium longipes thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
