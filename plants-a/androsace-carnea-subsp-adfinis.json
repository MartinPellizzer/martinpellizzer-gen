    "intro": "Androsace carnea subsp. adfinis, commonly known as the pink rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its compact growth and attractive flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
