    "intro": "Anthyllis balearica, commonly known as the Balearic clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly the Balearic Islands. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and clusters of pink or violet flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Anthyllis balearica thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Its delicate appearance and ecological importance make it a notable species in Mediterranean flora."
