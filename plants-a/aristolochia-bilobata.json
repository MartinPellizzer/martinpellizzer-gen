    "intro": "Aristolochia bilobata, commonly known as the twin-lobed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark blue to black berries in the fall. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted for attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
