    "intro": "Andropogon coleotrichus, commonly known as the hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-gray florets that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Andropogon coleotrichus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
