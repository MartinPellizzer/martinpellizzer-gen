    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lutea is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia lutea is also known for its yellow flowers and is often used in traditional medicine by local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lutea was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has been widely planted for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and its capacity to provide shade. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain regions. Overall, Acacia lutea is a versatile species that has been introduced for both environmental and practical benefits."
