    "intro": "Alsophila camerooniana var. ugandensis, commonly known as the Ugandan tree fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family. It is a tall, slender fern that can reach heights of up to 10 meters, characterized by its pinnate fronds and a central trunk composed of overlapping leaf bases. Native to the tropical rainforests of Central and East Africa, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a slow growth rate and is often found in montane or lowland forest areas. Its unique morphology makes it a valuable species for both ecological studies and horticultural appreciation."
