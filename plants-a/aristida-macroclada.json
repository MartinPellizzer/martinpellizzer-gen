    "intro": "Aristida macroclada, commonly known as the broadleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered in three to five rows along the stem. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and disturbed soils. Aristida macroclada is adapted to withstand drought and heat, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
