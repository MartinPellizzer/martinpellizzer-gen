    "intro": "[WRONG START] Annea hieracioides, commonly known as the silverleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued in xeriscaping for its drought tolerance and aesthetic appeal."
