    "intro": "Andropogon rottboellioides, commonly known as Rottboellioides bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. This grass is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
