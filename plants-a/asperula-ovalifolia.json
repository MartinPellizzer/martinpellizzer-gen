    "intro": "Asperula ovalifolia, commonly known as the ovalleaf woodruff, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. Asperula ovalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in gardens for its dense, compact growth habit."
