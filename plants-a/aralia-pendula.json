    "intro": "Aralia pendula, commonly known as the weeping aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its gracefully drooping clusters of white flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Its leaves are compound, with multiple narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Aralia pendula thrives in partial shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
