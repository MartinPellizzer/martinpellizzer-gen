    "intro": "Agrostis ramboi var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent meadowgrass, is a grass species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a pubescent appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and wet meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles."
