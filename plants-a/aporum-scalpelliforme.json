    "intro": "Aporum scalpelliforme, commonly known as the scalpel-shaped fern, is a unique fern species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble the blade of a scalpel, giving it its distinctive common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Aporum scalpelliforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
