    "intro": "Allium cabulicum, commonly known as the Persian leek, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its bulbous base and grass-like foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are edible, often used in Middle Eastern and Central Asian cuisines for their mild, onion-like flavor. Allium cabulicum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
