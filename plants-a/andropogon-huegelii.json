    "intro": "Andropogon huegelii, commonly known as Hugel's switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its robust root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
