    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. fallax, commonly known as autumn ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it an effective ground cover in shaded gardens."
