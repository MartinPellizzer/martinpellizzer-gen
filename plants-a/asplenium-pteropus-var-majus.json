    "intro": "Asplenium pteropus var. majus, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with closely spaced, lanceolate pinnae. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
