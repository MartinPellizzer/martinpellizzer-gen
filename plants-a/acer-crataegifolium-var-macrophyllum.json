    "intro": "Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a distinct flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its vibrant fall foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. This variety is found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streamside areas. It thrives in cool, temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is commonly found in mountainous regions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate moisture and partial sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer crataegifolium var. macrophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and along streams. This variety is known for its large, lobed leaves and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. It has been planted in both natural and cultivated landscapes due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
