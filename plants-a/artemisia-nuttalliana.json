    "intro": "Artemisia nuttalliana, commonly known as Nuttall's sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower clusters in the spring, which are followed by narrow, bracted seed heads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open plains, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Artemisia nuttalliana is adapted to withstand drought and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance."
