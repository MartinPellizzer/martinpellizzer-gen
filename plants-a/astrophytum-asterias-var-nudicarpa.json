    "intro": "Astrophytum asterias var. nudicarpa, commonly known as the Star Cactus or Moon Cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spherical shape and a star-like pattern of radial spines, which give it its common name. The plant has a short, thick stem that supports a dense cluster of spines, and it lacks the typical areoles found in other cacti. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, blooming in late spring or early summer. This variety is known for its compact growth and ability to thrive in well-draining soil with minimal water."
