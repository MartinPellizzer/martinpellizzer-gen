    "intro": "Andropogon chlorostachys, commonly known as green-stem grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to white flowers, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
