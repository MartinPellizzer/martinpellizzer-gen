    "intro": "Aloe droseroides, commonly known as the sticky aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are covered in a sticky substance that can trap insects, contributing to its survival. Aloe droseroides is well-suited for cultivation in dry climates with well-draining soil."
