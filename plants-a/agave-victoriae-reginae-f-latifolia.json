    "intro": "Agave victoriae-reginae f. latifolia, commonly known as the Queen Victoria agave, is a striking succulent native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are broader than the typical form, giving it a more robust appearance. The plant produces tall, spire-like flower stalks that bear clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
