It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, pendant-like yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves seasonally, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its ornamental value comes from its showy inflorescences, which resemble cascading showers of light yellow blooms.
