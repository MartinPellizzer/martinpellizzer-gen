    "intro": "Afrachneria, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plants typically have woody stems and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage. Afrachneria species are often used in traditional medicine, though their use is limited due to the plant's toxic properties."
