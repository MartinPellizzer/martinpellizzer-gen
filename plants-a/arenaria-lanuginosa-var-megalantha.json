    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa var. megalantha, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in cold climates."
