    "intro": "Artemisia genipi subsp. genipi, commonly known as the Mexican tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong, herbal scent. This subspecies is often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though its high concentration of volatile oils can be toxic in large doses."
