    "intro": "Aconitum rotundifolium var. tanguticum, commonly known as the Tangut monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions of China. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
