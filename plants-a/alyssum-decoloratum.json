    "intro": "Alyssum decoloratum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alyssum decoloratum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
