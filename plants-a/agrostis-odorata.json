    "intro": "Agrostis odorata, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of tiny, two-rowed flowers. Sweet grass is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It has been traditionally used by various indigenous cultures for ceremonial and practical purposes due to its aromatic properties and versatility."
