    "intro": "Acantholimon oliveri, commonly known as the Oliver's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical seed capsules that release seeds when mature. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon oliveri is primarily native to Iran and Iraq. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran and Iraq.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon oliveri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in coastal or inland regions with mild climates. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas where it can establish itself quickly. This plant thrives in environments with low to moderate moisture levels and is relatively tolerant of nutrient-poor soils. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States, where it has become an invasive species in some areas. Due to its adaptability, it can outcompete native vegetation, posing a threat to local ecosystems."
