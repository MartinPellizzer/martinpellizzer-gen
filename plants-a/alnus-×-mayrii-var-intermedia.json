    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 mayrii var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate alder, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Alnus glutinosa and Alnus incana. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in riparian zones or wetlands. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. The species is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
