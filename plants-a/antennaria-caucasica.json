    "intro": "Antennaria caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or white, arranged in small clusters, and bloom in early spring. Antennaria caucasica thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
