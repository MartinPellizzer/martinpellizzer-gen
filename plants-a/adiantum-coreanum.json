It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Adiantum coreanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
