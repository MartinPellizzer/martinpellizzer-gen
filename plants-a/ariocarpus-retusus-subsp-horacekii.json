It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered with spiny areoles and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces edible, red, fleshy fruits that are highly prized for their flavor and nutritional value. It thrives in arid environments with well-draining soil and requires minimal water.
