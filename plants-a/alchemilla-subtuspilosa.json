    "intro": "Alchemilla subtuspilosa, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
