    "intro": "Asplenium gracilescens, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a slender, creeping rhizome with small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 inches in length. Its fronds are simple and lack true veins, a characteristic common in many primitive ferns. Asplenium gracilescens is often found in humid, nutrient-rich soils and plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to organic matter decomposition."
