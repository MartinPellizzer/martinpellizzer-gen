    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lophantha var. speciosa is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This variety is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. It thrives in areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by wet winters and dry summers. The plant is often seen in open woodlands and along the edges of fynbos vegetation. It is well adapted to the local environmental conditions and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lophantha var. speciosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. The introduction occurred in the 19th century, during the period of European settlement. It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered a naturalized species in some regions. However, it is not classified as an invasive species in New Zealand."
