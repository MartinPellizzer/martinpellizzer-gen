    "intro": "Arenaria cariensis, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a flowering plant native to the coastal areas of southern Africa. It is a small, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria cariensis is often found in dunes and along the edges of beaches, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
