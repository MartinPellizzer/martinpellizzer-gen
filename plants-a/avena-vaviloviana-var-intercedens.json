It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or for erosion control."
