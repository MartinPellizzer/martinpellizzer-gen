    "intro": "Angorkis striata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf angorkis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in dense inflorescences, often displaying a range of colors from yellow to orange. Angorkis striata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
