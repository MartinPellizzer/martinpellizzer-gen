    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early pasqueflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in early spring, often in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a short, stout stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed and hairy. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. The flower structure includes a central cluster of stamens surrounded by a ring of petal-like sepals, making it distinct within the Ranunculaceae family."
