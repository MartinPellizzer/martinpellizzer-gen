    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cordatum is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the southeastern regions of the country, including the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value, it has also been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cordatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was brought there during the 19th century by European botanists and gardeners who sought to cultivate exotic species. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of these regions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its widespread establishment."
