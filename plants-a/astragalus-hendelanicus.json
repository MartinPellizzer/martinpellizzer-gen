    "intro": "Astragalus hendelanicus, commonly known as the Hendel's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus hendelanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
