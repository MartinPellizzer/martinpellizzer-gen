    "intro": "Aerva scandens, commonly known as the climbing vervain, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across other vegetation. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warm seasons. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Aerva scandens is adapted to thrive in moist, sunny environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
