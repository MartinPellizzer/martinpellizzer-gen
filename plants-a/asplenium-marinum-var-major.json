    "intro": "Asplenium marinum var. major, commonly known as the sea spleenwort, is a fern species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. It thrives in rocky, saline environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in shaded, moist areas near the sea. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. It reproduces via spores and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an important indicator species for coastal ecosystems."
