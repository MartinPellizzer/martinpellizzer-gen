    "intro": "Asplenium rosenstockianum, commonly known as the Rosenstock's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium rosenstockianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
