    "intro": "Angostura silvestris, commonly known as the wild angostura, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, and its elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
