It is also found in parts of southern Asia, particularly in India and Sri Lanka. This plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. It is often cultivated for its edible seeds and ornamental value. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus betulifolius was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential as a medicinal plant. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Its distinctive leaf shape and showy flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
