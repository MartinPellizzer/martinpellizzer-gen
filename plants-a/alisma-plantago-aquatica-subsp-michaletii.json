    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. michaletii, commonly known as the Michaleti's water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Asia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette at the base, with a smooth, waxy surface adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. This subspecies is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along slow-moving streams."
