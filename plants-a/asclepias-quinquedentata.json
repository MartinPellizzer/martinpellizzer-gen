    "intro": "Asclepias quinquedentata, commonly known as the five-toothed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Asclepias quinquedentata is an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
