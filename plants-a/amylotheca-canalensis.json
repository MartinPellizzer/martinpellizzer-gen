    "intro": "Amylotheca canalensis, commonly known as the canalensis lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its leathery, greenish-yellow thallus with distinct, elongated lobes. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its nutritional needs. It is typically found on tree bark and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
