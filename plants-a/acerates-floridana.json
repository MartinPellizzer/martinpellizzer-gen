    "intro": "Acerates floridana, commonly known as the Florida maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that aid in its dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 15-30 feet and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native landscapes and ecological restoration projects.",
