    "intro": "Athyrium acutidentatum, commonly known as the sharp-toothed wood fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a fern characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium acutidentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
