    "intro": "Apocynum farwellii f. ternarium, commonly known as the Farwell's milkweed, is a variant of the showy milkweed species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a cluster. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
