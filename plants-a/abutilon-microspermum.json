    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon microspermum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the states of Par\u00e1, Amazonas, and Maranh\u00e3o. This plant thrives in humid tropical environments, often in lowland areas with rich soil. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is closely associated with the Amazon Basin and surrounding regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon microspermum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy foliage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction has raised concerns among ecologists about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
