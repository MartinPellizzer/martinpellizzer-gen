    "intro": "Acer pictum var. pubigerum, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a variant of the striped maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely toothed leaves that often display a striking combination of green, red, and yellow hues during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming more rugged with age. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
