    "intro": "Atriplex paludosa subsp. graciliflora, commonly known as slender-flowered saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to wetland and marshy areas of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil in wetland habitats. This subspecies is often found in association with other salt-tolerant plants in coastal and inland wetlands."
