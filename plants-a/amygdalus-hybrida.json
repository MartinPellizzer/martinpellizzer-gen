    "intro": "Amygdalus hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid of Prunus dulcis (sweet almond) and Prunus amygdalus (bitter almond), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by edible drupes containing a single seed. Its leaves are oval and have serrated edges, and the bark is smooth with a grayish-brown color. Amygdalus hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for the production of almonds."
