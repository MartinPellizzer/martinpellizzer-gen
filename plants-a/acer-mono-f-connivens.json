    "intro": "Acer mono f. connivens, commonly known as the hairy maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the mono maple. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a unique appearance compared to typical maple species. The leaves are typically smaller and more rounded, with a velvety texture. This form is often found in specific microhabitats where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical interest lies in its morphological variation and ecological niche.",
