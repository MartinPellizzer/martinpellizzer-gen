It features compound leaves that are typically divided into three parts, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are often borne on long, slender stalks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, swampy environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
