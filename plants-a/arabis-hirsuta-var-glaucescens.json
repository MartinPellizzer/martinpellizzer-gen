    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
