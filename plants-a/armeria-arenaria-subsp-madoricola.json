    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. madoricola, commonly known as the sand armeria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or coastal habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils in maritime environments."
