    "intro": "Acalypha controversa, commonly known as the red-veined nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful foliage, with leaves often displaying vivid red, orange, or yellow veins against a contrasting green background. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or forest understories. Acalypha controversa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha controversa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like forest edges and agricultural lands. It is also present in some parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha controversa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there in the early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking to add unique visual elements to landscapes. Despite its initial aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island environments."
