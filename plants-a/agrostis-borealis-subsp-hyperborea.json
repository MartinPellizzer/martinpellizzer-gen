    "intro": "Agrostis borealis subsp. hyperborea, commonly known as the Arctic grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. This subspecies is adapted to long periods of cold and limited sunlight, making it a key component of polar ecosystems."
