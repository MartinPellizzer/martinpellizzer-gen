    "intro": "Astragalus radiciflorus, commonly known as the root-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system that allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. It is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus radiciflorus is often found in disturbed sites and is considered an important species for ecological restoration projects."
