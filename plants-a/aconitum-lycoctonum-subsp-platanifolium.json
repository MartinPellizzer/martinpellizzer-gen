    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. platanifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features large, palmately divided leaves that are often mistaken for those of other toxic plants. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its high toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
