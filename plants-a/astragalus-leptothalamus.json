    "intro": "Astragalus leptothalamus, commonly known as the narrow-cupped milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus leptothalamus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and supports local pollinators."
