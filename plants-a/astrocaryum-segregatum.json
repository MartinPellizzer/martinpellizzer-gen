    "intro": "Astrocaryum segregatum, commonly known as the yellow palm or Brazilian yellow palm, is a species of palm native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, fibrous fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
