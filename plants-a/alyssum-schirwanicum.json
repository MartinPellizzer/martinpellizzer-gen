It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage and is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates.
