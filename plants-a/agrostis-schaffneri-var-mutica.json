    "intro": "Agrostis schaffneri var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. The variety *mutica* is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent leaves, giving it a distinctive texture and appearance."
