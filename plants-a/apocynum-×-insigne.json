    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 insigne, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a hybrid plant that combines traits from Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed). It is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States, characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Apocynum \u00d7 insigne plays a role in supporting pollinators, though its toxicity limits its use in some horticultural settings."
