    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant white fir, is a variant of the white fir species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which can reach heights of up to 50 meters. The needles are flat, dark green, and have a waxy coating, while the cones are cylindrical and typically measure around 15\u201320 centimeters in length. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine regions. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to extreme climates and its role in the ecological dynamics of mountainous ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. gigantea is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the western Himalayas, particularly in countries such as India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This variety is found in temperate to subalpine forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters above sea level. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of mountainous terrain. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. gigantea was mainly introduced to areas with high altitude and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires ample sunlight for optimal growth. This variety is often planted for its ornamental value due to its tall, conical shape and dense foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and Asia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
