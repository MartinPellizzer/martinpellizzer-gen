    "intro": "Angelica atropurpurea, commonly known as purple angelica, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. The roots are thick, fleshy, and contain compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine."
