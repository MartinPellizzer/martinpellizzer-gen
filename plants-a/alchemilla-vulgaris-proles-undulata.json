    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris proles undulata, commonly known as the undulating lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, heart-shaped leaves that have a distinctive undulating margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to form dense ground cover."
