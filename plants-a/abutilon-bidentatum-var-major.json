    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon bidentatum var. major is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions of Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal areas and wetlands. This variant of Abutilon bidentatum is known for its distinctive two-toothed leaves and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also found in some parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon bidentatum var. major was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, woolly foliage. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wetlands. It has become naturalized in many parts of its introduced range, sometimes spreading aggressively. Despite its beauty, it can be invasive in certain environments, outcompeting native vegetation."
