    "intro": "Alnus ferruginea var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the rusty alder, is a variant of the European alder characterized by its distinctive rusty-brown bark and oval, obtuse leaves. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting wildlife in forested areas. Its adaptability to various environmental conditions makes it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
