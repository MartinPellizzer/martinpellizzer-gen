    "intro": "Airopsis ampla, commonly known as the giant sea lettuce, is a large, green algae that thrives in coastal marine environments. It forms dense, sprawling mats on the seafloor, often in shallow, sheltered waters. The plant has a flattened, leaf-like structure that can grow up to several meters in length. It is characterized by its simple, unbranched thallus and lack of true roots or leaves. Airopsis ampla plays an important role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
