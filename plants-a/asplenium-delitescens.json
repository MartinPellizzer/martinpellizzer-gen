    "intro": "Asplenium delitescens, commonly known as the fading spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often exhibit a bluish tinge. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Asplenium delitescens is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
