It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often hairy and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in brackish or saline soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its root system helps stabilize shorelines and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
