    "intro": "Atriplex lindleyi subsp. lindleyi, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This subspecies is often found in sandy or saline soils and plays a role in stabilizing desert landscapes."
