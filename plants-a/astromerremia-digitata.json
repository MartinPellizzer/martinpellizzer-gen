    "intro": "Astromerremia digitata, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features a thick, fleshy stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, often shedding during drought periods. The sap of Astromerremia digitata is milky and can cause skin irritation, making it important to handle the plant with care."
