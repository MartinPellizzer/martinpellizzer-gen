    "intro": "Alsophila confinis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk and feathery, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its tall, erect stem, while its fronds are composed of numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. Alsophila confinis plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
