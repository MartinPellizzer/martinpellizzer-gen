    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. viminalis is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the western Himalayas, including parts of northern India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This variety is typically found in alpine and subalpine forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in association with other coniferous species. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and limited sunlight. Its distribution is relatively restricted compared to other varieties of Abies excelsa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. viminalis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It is valued for its slender, weeping form and dark green foliage, making it a popular choice for gardeners and landscapers. This variety is often used in rock gardens, as a specimen plant, or in formal garden settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade conditions. However, it is important to note that it may require protection from strong winds and extreme weather."
