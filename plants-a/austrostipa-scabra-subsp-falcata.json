    "intro": "Austrostipa scabra subsp. falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like cluster of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
