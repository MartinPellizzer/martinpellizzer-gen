    "intro": "Aeschynomene gracilipes, commonly known as slenderleaf goffer, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are characteristic of the legume family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Aeschynomene gracilipes is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
