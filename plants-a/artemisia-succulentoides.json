    "intro": "Artemisia succulentoides, commonly known as the silverleaf artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features silvery-gray foliage with a distinctive aromatic scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces fluffy, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean climates."
