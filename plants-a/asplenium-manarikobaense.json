    "intro": "Asplenium manarikobaense, commonly known as the Manarikoba spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces small, clustered leaves that are lanceolate in shape. Its fronds are usually dark green and lack true veins, characteristic of many primitive ferns. Asplenium manarikobaense is found in tropical regions, particularly in parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands."
