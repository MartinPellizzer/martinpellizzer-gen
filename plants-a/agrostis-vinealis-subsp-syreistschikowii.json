It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a stabilizing plant in coastal and arid habitats."
