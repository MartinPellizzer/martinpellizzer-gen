    "intro": "Alnus maritima subsp. metoporina, commonly known as the coastal alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the Atlantic coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and coastal woodlands. It plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and periodic flooding makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
