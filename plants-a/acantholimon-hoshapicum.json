    "intro": "Acantholimon hoshapicum, commonly known as the Hoshap's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon hoshapicum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in the eastern part of the country, particularly in the regions of eastern Anatolia. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is relatively restricted, making it a regionally significant species within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hoshapicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky slopes, gravelly plains, and disturbed soils where it can establish itself quickly. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the western United States. Its distribution is largely limited by its specific ecological requirements and the availability of suitable habitats."
