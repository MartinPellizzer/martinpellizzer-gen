    "intro": "Apodytes yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan apodytes, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Apodanthaceae, which is characterized by its unique parasitic growth habit. The plant is notable for its lack of leaves, relying instead on its host for photosynthesis. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
