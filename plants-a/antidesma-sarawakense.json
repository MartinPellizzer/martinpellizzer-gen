    "intro": "Antidesma sarawakense, commonly known as the Sarawak antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in Borneo. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
