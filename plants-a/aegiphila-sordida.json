    "intro": "Aegiphila sordida, commonly known as the sordid aegiphila, is a shrub native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine, whitish coating that helps reduce water loss. Aegiphila sordida is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
