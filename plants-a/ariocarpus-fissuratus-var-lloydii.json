    "intro": "Ariocarpus fissuratus var. lloydii, commonly known as the \"Lloyd's fissured liverwort,\" is a rare and unique member of the Cactaceae family. It is characterized by its flat, segmented stems that resemble a liver, hence its common name. The plant is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in the spring, and it produces small, red, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
