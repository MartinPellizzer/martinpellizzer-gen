    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberia mollis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. It is often associated with understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Its natural range extends into parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberia mollis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is often found in roadside embankments and degraded landscapes. Its introduction has helped in preventing further soil degradation in certain regions. However, it is important to monitor its spread to avoid potential ecological impacts."
