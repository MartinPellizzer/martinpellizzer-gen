    "intro": "Atriplex tornabenei var. pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
