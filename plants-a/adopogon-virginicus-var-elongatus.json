    "intro": "Adopogon virginicus var. elongatus, commonly known as the tall sand grass, is a perennial grass native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a key role in stabilizing dune systems and supporting local wildlife.",
