    "intro": "Astragalus vogelii, commonly known as Vogel's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Astragalus vogelii is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
