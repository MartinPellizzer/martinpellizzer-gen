It features a dense, compact growth habit with numerous small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
