    "intro": "Anisum stadense, commonly known as European anise, is a biennial or perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. Its essential oils, rich in anethole, contribute to its distinctive licorice-like fragrance. Anisum stadense thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields."
