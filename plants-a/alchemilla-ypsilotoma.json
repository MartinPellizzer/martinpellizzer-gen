    "intro": "Alchemilla ypsilotoma, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help to retain moisture and reduce water loss."
