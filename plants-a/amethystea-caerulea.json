    "intro": "Amethystea caerulea, commonly known as the sky-blue amethyst, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, lavender-blue petals that bloom in late summer, creating a striking contrast against its silver-green foliage. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is known for its resilience in cold, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Amethystea caerulea is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike."
