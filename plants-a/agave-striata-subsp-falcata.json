It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
