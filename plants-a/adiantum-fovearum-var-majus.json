    "intro": "Adiantum fovearum var. majus, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a striking fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, fan-shaped structure, with the undersides of the pinnae bearing small, raised glands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
