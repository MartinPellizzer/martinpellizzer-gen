    "intro": "Aspidium molle var. decurtatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden beds or woodland environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clusters over time. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, temperate climates."
