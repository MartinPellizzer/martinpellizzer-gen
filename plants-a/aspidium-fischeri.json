    "intro": "Aspidium fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments near streams and marshes. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sporangia. Its unique luminescence is due to the presence of bioluminescent compounds in its cells, making it a rare and intriguing botanical specimen."
