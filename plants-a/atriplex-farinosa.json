    "intro": "Atriplex farinosa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to harsh, saline environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity. Atriplex farinosa is also valued for its use in livestock forage and for stabilizing soils in erosion-prone areas."
