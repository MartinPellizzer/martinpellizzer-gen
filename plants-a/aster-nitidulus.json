    "intro": "Aster nitidulus, commonly known as the smooth aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The smooth aster is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
