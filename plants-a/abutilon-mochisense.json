    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mochisense is primarily native to Central America, specifically the countries of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth. It is known for its distinctive, lantern-shaped flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Abutilon mochisense plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mochisense was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for local wildlife. It has become naturalized in several states, including Oregon and Washington. However, its spread is carefully monitored to prevent it from becoming invasive in native ecosystems."
