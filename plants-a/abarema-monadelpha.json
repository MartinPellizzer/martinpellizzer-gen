    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema monadelpha is primarily native to South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and other tropical regions of the continent. This plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within dense forest understories. It is well adapted to the high rainfall and warm climate of these regions. Abarema monadelpha is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed sites within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema monadelpha was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering. It has since spread to other regions, including parts of Central America and the Caribbean, where it has become naturalized. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively contribute to its invasive potential in new environments. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in all regions where it has been introduced."
