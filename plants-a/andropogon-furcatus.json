    "intro": "Andropogon furcatus, commonly known as little bluestem, is a native grass species found throughout much of North America. It is a warm-season grass that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairie ecosystems. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pink to purple in color. It is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration. Little bluestem also plays an important role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
