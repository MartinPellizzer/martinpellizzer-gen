    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. dealbatus, commonly known as the white bluestem, is a variant of the big bluestem grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its pale blue to white inflorescence, which distinguishes it from the more common green inflorescence of the typical big bluestem. This plant is a warm-season grass that thrives in prairie and open woodland habitats, often found in well-drained soils. It plays a vital role in ecological systems by providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil through its extensive root system. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
