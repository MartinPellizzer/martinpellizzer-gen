    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus, commonly known as the mapleleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western and central regions of Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its bark is smooth and grey, becoming fissured with age, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall.",
