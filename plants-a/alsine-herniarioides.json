    "intro": "Alsine herniarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of 5 to 15 centimeters and has small, linear to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. Alsine herniarioides is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes."
