    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. reniformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, kidney-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces upright stems bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to retain moisture."
