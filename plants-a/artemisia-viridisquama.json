    "intro": "Artemisia viridisquama, commonly known as green-squamate wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal remedies for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
