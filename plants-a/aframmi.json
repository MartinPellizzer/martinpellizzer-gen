It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit that resembles a small, elongated egg. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually green or yellow, and are clustered in umbels. The fruit, which is the main edible part, contains a white, fleshy pulp with a mild, slightly bitter taste."
