    "intro": "Aloe semimargaritifera, commonly known as the rock aloe or Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky soils, while its leaves store water efficiently. Aloe semimargaritifera is valued for its resilience and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
