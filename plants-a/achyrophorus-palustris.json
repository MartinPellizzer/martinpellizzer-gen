    "intro": "Achyrophorus palustris, commonly known as the swamp aster, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates.",
