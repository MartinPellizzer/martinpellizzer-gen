It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient member of the Caryophyllaceae family."
