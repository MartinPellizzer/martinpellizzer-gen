It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous, giving it its subspecies name. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries.

Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
