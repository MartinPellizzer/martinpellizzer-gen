    "intro": "Acrodiclidium limbosum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates.",
