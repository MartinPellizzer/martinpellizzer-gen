    "intro": "Actinotus omnifertilis, commonly known as the many-seeded star-flower, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its star-shaped, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the fruit is a capsule that releases numerous small seeds. Actinotus omnifertilis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinators.",
