    "intro": "Aconitum hemsleyanum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features striking, dark purple foliage that contrasts beautifully with its tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in dense, spikelike clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
