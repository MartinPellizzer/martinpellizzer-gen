    "intro": "Andropogon villosus subvar. leianthus, commonly known as the silky grass or silky bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and tufted inflorescence, which consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, bluish-gray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in wetland restoration projects."
