    "intro": "Armeria allioides var. flaccida, commonly known as the softleaf sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form compact, evergreen mats that provide year-round interest."
