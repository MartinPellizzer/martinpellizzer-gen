    "intro": "Ascidieria grandis, commonly known as the large bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It possesses small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can effectively capture its prey. Its leaves are submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Ascidieria grandis plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
