It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. This variant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant is also found in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and Samoa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha unibracteata var. heterantha was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant. The plant's ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions makes it a versatile choice for various garden settings. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
