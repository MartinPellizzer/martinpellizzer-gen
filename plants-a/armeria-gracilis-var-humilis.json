    "intro": "Armeria gracilis var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
