    "intro": "Avellara, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Avellara is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Its botanical name, *Schinus terebinthifolius*, reflects its close relation to the cashew family."
