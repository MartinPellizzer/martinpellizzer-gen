    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 multifidum var. sakuraii, commonly known as the Sakurai's Japanese fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often arched or semi-circular in growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
