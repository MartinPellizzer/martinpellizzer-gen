    "intro": "Asclepias flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias flanaganii is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
