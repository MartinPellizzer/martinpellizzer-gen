    "intro": "Arenaria capitata, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its flowers are typically surrounded by a dense ring of leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. Arenaria capitata is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
