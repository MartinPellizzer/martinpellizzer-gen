    "intro": "Agrostis pubicallis, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis pubicallis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
