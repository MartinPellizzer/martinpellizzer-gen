    "intro": "Asplenium nesioticum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Its fronds are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Asplenium nesioticum is a hardy plant that thrives in humid conditions and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
