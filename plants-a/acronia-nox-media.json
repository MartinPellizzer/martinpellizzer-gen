    "intro": "Acronia nox-media, commonly known as the night-flowering acronia, is a unique species of flowering plant characterized by its nocturnal blooming habit. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is native to specific regions in South America. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant's adaptation to low-light conditions makes it an intriguing subject for botanical study.",
