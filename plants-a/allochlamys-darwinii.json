    "intro": "Allochlamys darwinii, commonly known as the Darwin's alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, with five petals that are fused at the base. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Allochlamys darwinii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
