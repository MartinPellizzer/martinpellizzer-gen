    "intro": "Artanthe verbascifolia, commonly known as the Woollyleaf sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly foliage and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
