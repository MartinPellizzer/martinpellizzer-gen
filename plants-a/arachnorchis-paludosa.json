    "intro": "Arachnorchis paludosa, commonly known as the marsh spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of southeastern Australia. It typically grows in damp, shaded environments, such as swamps and heathlands, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, showy greenish-yellow flower that has a distinctive spider-like appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is noted for its unique morphology and ecological specificity, making it a rare and specialized member of the orchid family."
