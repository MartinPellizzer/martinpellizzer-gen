    "intro": "Arabidopsis, commonly known as thale cress, is a small flowering plant native to Eurasia. It is widely recognized for its simple genome and rapid life cycle, making it a model organism in plant biology. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny white flowers. Its roots are often studied for their role in plant development and stress responses. Arabidopsis is particularly valuable in genetic research due to its ease of cultivation and genetic simplicity."
