    "intro": "Astragalus dinawarii, commonly known as the Dinawari milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus dinawarii is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
