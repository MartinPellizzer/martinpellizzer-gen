    "intro": "Ateramnus hypoleucus, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ateramnus hypoleucus is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it thrives in full sun."
