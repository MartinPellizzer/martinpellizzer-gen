    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. melanospermus, commonly known as blackseed sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its dark, almost black seeds. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with sturdy stalks and narrow leaves. Its seeds are rich in nutrients and have been used traditionally for food and animal feed. The dark coloration of the seeds is due to high levels of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties."
