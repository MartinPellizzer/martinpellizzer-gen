    "intro": "Antrophyum superficiale, commonly known as the surface antrophyum, is a unique plant species characterized by its specialized growth pattern. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found on the surfaces of other plants or in shaded, moist environments. The plant's structure is adapted for epiphytic or lithophytic growth, allowing it to absorb nutrients from its surroundings. Its botanical features include small, clustered leaves and specialized root systems that anchor it to its substrate. Despite its delicate appearance, it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
