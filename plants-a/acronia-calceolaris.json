    "intro": "Acronia calceolaris, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. Acronia calceolaris is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats.",
