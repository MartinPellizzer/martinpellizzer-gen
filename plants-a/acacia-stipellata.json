    "intro": "Acacia stipellata, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and dry inland areas. Acacia stipellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia stipellata is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in dry, open forests and woodland areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or rocky habitats. It is well adapted to the semi-arid and arid climates of its native range. Acacia stipellata plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stipellata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along the edges of forests, thriving in sandy soils. The plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil with its extensive root system. It is also valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat for local wildlife. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in some ecosystems."
