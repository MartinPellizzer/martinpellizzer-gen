    "intro": "Atriplex oahuensis, commonly known as O\u02bbahu saltbush, is a shrub native to the Hawaiian island of O\u02bbahu. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in coastal areas and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Atriplex oahuensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
