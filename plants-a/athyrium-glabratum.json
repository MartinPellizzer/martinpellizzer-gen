    "intro": "Athyrium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and smooth to the touch. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium glabratum plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various invertebrates and small animals."
