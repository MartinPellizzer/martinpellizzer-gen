    "intro": "Apocopis tridentatus, commonly known as the three-toothed orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with three prominent teeth on the lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include strap-like leaves and a slender stem that supports its fragrant, showy blooms. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
