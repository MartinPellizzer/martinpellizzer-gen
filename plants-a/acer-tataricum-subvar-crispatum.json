It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated, and often curly leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters and has a spreading, multi-stemmed form. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
