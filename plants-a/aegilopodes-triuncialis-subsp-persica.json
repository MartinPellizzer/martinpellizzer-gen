    "intro": "Aegilopodes triuncialis subsp. persica, commonly known as Persian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
