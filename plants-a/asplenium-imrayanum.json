    "intro": "Asplenium imrayanum, commonly known as the Imrayan shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen appearance with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to form dense clusters of foliage. Asplenium imrayanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
