    "intro": "Alyssum pluscanescens, commonly known as sticky alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, often sticky leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Alyssum pluscanescens is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and ladybugs."
