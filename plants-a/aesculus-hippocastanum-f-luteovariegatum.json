    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aesculus hippocastum f. luteovariegatum, commonly known as the yellow-variegated horse chestnut, is a variant of the horse chestnut tree characterized by its distinctive yellow and white variegation on its leaves. This form exhibits a unique leaf pattern that differs from the typical green foliage of the standard Aesculus hippocastanum. The plant is a deciduous tree that produces large, showy white or pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The fruit, known as a burr, contains spiny seeds that are not typically edible."
