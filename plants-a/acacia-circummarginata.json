    "intro": "Acacia circummarginata, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are typically followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes and rocky areas. Acacia circummarginata is adapted to salty air and can tolerate moderate drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia circummarginata is primarily native to northern Australia, including the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This species is often associated with mulga woodlands and open shrublands. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Acacia circummarginata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia circummarginata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation and land rehabilitation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility over time. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and supporting local biodiversity. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
