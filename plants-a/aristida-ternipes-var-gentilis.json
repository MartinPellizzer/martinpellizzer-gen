It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces delicate, bristle-like awns that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. This grass is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native plant communities."
