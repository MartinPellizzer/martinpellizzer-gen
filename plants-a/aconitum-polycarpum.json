    "intro": "Aconitum polycarpum, commonly known as the many-seeded aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, conical inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deeply lobed structure that enhances its ornamental appeal. Aconitum polycarpum contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.",
