    "intro": "Arbutus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping arbutus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western coast of North America. It features small, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Its root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically significant in its habitat."
