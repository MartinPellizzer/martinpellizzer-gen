    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. elephantidens, commonly known as the elephant tooth, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in a layer of white, powdery wax that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, red or orange flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often sought after by cactus enthusiasts and is considered a rare and valuable species."
