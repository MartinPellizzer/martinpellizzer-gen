    "intro": "Anthericum rubellum, commonly known as the red nettle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive red stems and heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on long, slender spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Anthericum rubellum is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these habitats."
