    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. vulgaris, commonly known as the green alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins. The plant is often found in moist, acidic soils, such as those in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it useful for soil enrichment. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
