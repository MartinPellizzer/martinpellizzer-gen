    "intro": "Aspidium dilatatum var. azoricum, commonly known as the Azorean water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to the Azores. It is a perennial fern characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense mats. Its rhizomes are often rooted in the substrate, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually dark green and can vary in shape depending on the water conditions and light exposure."
