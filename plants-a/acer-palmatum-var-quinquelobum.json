    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. quinquelobum, commonly known as the five-lobed Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected, five-lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded or irregular crown. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces small, red samaras for seed dispersal. The leaves are often used in ornamental horticulture for their aesthetic appeal and seasonal color changes.",
