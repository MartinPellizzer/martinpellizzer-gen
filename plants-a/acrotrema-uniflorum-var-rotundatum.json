    "intro": "Acrotrema uniflorum var. rotundatum, commonly known as the rounded acrotrema, is a rare and specialized liverwort species found in specific, often moist and shaded habitats. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its compact, thalloid structure with a distinctive, rounded growth form. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a dorsiventral thallus and a well-developed central strand, typical of many hepatic species. Its reproductive structures, including leafy shoots and sporophytes, are adapted for dispersal in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered an important indicator species for undisturbed microhabitats.",
