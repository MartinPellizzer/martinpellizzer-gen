    "intro": "Ardisia japonica var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, dark purple berries that are clustered and highly ornamental, often used in landscaping. The plant has glossy, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall, adding seasonal interest. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. The berries are edible for birds but are generally not recommended for human consumption due to their bitter taste."
