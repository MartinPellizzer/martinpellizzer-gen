    "intro": "Aspidium plantagineum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium plantagineum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
