    "intro": "Asplenium fragrans var. foeniculaceum, commonly known as the sweet fern or fragrant spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that emit a subtle, aromatic scent, especially when crushed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique fragrance and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
