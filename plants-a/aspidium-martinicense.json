It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin, and its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the leaves. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its preference for well-drained soil. The botanical features of Aspidium martinicense make it an important species in ecological studies of fern diversity."
