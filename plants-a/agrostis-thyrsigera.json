    "intro": "Agrostis thyrsigera, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Agrostis thyrsigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
