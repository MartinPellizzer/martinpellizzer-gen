    "intro": "Avenella, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense, spreading foliage. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Avenella thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Its hardy nature makes it a useful plant for erosion control and habitat restoration."
