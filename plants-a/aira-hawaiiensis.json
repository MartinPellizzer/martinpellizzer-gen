    "intro": "Aira hawaiiensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian aira, is a perennial grass native to the island of Hawaii. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in coastal and lowland areas. The plant features slender, grass-like blades with a bluish-green color and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to the tropical climate and is often found in native vegetation communities. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
