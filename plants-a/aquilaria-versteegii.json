    "intro": "Aquilaria versteegii, commonly known as the Java agarwood, is a valuable tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly sought after in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and requires a warm, moist climate to thrive. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly pubescent underside, while its flowers are small and clustered in axillary inflorescences. The tree's unique scent is produced through a complex chemical process involving the secretion of sesquiterpenes in its heartwood."
