    "intro": "Agrostis wacei, commonly known as Wace's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
