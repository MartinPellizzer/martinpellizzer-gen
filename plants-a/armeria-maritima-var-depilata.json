    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. depilata, commonly known as the hairless sea thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This variety is distinguished from the typical form by its reduced leaf pubescence, giving it a more refined appearance."
