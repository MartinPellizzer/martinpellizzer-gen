    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. lineariloba, commonly known as the linear-leaved anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and contributes to its ecological value in native habitats."
