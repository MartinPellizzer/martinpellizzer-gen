    "intro": "Amblovenatum terminans, commonly known as the twilight orchid, is a rare and unique plant species found in the dense, humid undergrowth of tropical rainforests. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a soft glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitat. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, with intricate pollination mechanisms that rely on specific nocturnal insects. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, Amblovenatum terminans is considered a vulnerable species."
