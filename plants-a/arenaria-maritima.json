    "intro": "Arenaria maritima, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy and salty environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in early summer. Arenaria maritima plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small organisms."
