    "intro": "Agrostis \u00d7 paramushirensis, commonly known as the Japanese bentgrass, is a hybrid grass species that combines traits from both Agrostis stolonifera and Agrostis alba. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, carpet-like foliage, making it suitable for ornamental and turfgrass applications. The plant typically grows in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
