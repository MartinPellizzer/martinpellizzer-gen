    "intro": "Amorphophallus angolensis subsp. angolensis, commonly known as the African giant arrowroot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant produces a starchy underground tuber, which is the primary edible part. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or swampy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and economic value, it is of interest for both botanical study and potential agricultural use."
