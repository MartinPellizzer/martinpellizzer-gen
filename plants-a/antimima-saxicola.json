    "intro": "Antimima saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture. Its small, yellowish-green flowers bloom in clusters, adding a subtle aesthetic to its harsh environment. Antimima saxicola is often found in rocky outcrops and is a characteristic component of fynbos vegetation."
