    "intro": "Aucellia sophronitis, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that float on the water's surface, with petals that range from white to pink. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that anchor it in muddy substrates, while its broad, heart-shaped leaves provide buoyancy. Its growth cycle is closely tied to seasonal water levels, with flowers blooming during the wet season. Aucellia sophronitis is also noted for its symbolic significance in various cultural and religious traditions."
