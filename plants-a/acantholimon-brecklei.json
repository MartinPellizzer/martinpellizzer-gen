    "intro": "Acantholimon brecklei, commonly known as Breckley's thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features spiny stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region, including low precipitation and extreme temperature variations. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the unique biodiversity of Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon brecklei was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of a horticultural collection from the Mediterranean region. The plant is now found in several regions across the country, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. It has established itself in disturbed soils and open habitats. However, it is not considered to be a major invasive species in New Zealand."
