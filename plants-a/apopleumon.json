    "intro": "Apopleumon, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and its unique ability to thrive without soil, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi. The plant's roots are specialized to absorb nutrients from the air and water, a trait known as epiphytism. Apopleumon typically grows on the trunks of trees in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
