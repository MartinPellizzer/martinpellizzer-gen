It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous and wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid regions."
