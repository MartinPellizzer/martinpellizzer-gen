    "intro": "Antirrhinum braun-blanquetii var. oreophilum, commonly known as the oreophilic snapdragon, is a rare and striking member of the Plantaginaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. Native to specific high-altitude regions in the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees, due to their shape and nectar production. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
