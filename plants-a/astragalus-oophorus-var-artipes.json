    "intro": "Astragalus oophorus var. artipes, commonly known as the \"eggplant milkvetch,\" is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense racemes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system for accessing groundwater. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-nutrient conditions."
