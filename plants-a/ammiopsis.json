    "intro": "Ammiopsis, commonly known as the \"false angel's trumpets,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Apiaceae family. These plants are native to South America and are characterized by their showy, often fragrant, umbellate flowers. Ammiopsis species typically have finely divided, fern-like leaves and produce small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. They are often grown as ornamental plants due to their attractive foliage and blooms. However, they can be toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when handling them."
