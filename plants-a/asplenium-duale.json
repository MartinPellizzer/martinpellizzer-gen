    "intro": "Asplenium duale, commonly known as the double spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often densely packed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium duale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
