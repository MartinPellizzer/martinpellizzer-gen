    "intro": "Amelanchier nitens, commonly known as the Pacific serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red to black in color, often ripening in late spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The Pacific serviceberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife value, providing food for birds and small mammals."
