    "intro": "Alisma subalatum var. minus, commonly known as the lesser marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of Alisma subalatum."
