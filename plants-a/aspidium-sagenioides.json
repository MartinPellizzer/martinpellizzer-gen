    "intro": "Aspidium sagenioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Aspidium sagenioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic foliage."
