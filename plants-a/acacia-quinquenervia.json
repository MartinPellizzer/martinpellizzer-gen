    "intro": "Acacia quinquenervia, commonly known as the five-veined acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves with five distinct veins on each leaflet. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia quinquenervia is also known for its ecological importance, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia quinquenervia is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. The species is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia quinquenervia was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, often as an ornamental plant or for its hardy nature. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. The plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain environments. Due to its adaptability, it is now considered a potential weed in some regions where it has escaped cultivation."
