    "intro": "Atriplex semibaccata var. typica, commonly known as the silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and often have a distinctive waxy coating, adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
