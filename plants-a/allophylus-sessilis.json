    "intro": "Allophylus sessilis, commonly known as the sessile-leaf alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in coastal areas and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are sessile, meaning they attach directly to the stem without a stalk. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Allophylus sessilis has a compact growth habit and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for local wildlife."
