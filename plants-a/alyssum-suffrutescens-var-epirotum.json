    "intro": "Alyssum suffrutescens var. epirotum, commonly known as the Epirotic Alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial pollinators."
