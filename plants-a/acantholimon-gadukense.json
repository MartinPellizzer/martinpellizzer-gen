    "intro": "Acantholimon gadukense, commonly known as the Gadukense Thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Acantholimon gadukense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in rocky habitats.",

This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in arid and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of these areas. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gadukense was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This plant is typically found in regions with a continental climate, characterized by cold winters and warm summers. It is often associated with limestone or sandstone substrates. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America."
