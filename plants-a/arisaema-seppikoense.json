    "intro": "Arisaema seppikoense, commonly known as the Japanese cobra plant, is a flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix, which is often covered in a dense mass of tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The spathe is typically colored in a striking pattern, sometimes with a reddish or purple hue, adding to its ornamental appeal."
