    "intro": "Aloe littoralis, commonly known as the coastal aloe, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers during the warmer months. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing near the edges of dunes or in rocky coastal areas."
