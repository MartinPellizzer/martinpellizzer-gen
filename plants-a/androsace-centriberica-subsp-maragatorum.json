    "intro": "Androsace centriberica subsp. maragatorum, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, rosette-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The flowers are usually white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high-altitude conditions."
