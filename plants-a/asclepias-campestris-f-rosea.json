    "intro": "Asclepias campestris f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered milkweed, is a cultivar of the common milkweed, characterized by its distinctive pink to rose-colored flowers. It is a perennial herb native to North America, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces silky, white seed pods that release tiny seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Asclepias campestris f. rosea is a valuable host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a diverse array of pollinators. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
