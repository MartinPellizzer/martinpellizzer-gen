    "intro": "Alsine langii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandgrass, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of slender, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and it relies on wind pollination. Alsine langii is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat."
