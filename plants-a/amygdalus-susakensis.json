    "intro": "Amygdalus susakensis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre peach. This species is native to the western United States, particularly California, and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree with smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves. The plant produces white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by peach-like fruits that are typically small and yellow when ripe. Amygdalus susakensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
