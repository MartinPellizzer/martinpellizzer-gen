    "intro": "Arum dracunculus, commonly known as the death cup, is a striking tropical plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a large, umbrella-shaped leaf that can grow up to 3 feet in diameter, with a distinctive purple-tinged stem. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a showy, hood-like spathe. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to thrive. The plant is also notable for its toxic properties, containing calcium oxalate crystals that can cause irritation upon contact."
