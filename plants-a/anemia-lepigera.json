    "intro": "Anemia lepigera, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herbaceous plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils such as those in agricultural fields or along roadsides. Anemia lepigera is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in many regions."
