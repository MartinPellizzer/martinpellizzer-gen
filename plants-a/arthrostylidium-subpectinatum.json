It has small, narrow, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain seeds covered in a sticky substance to aid in attachment to host plants. This species is often found growing on eucalyptus trees and other shrubs in dry, open habitats."
