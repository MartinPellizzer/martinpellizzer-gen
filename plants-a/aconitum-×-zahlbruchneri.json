    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 zahlbruchneri, commonly known as the Zahnbuchner's monkshood, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, compound leaves with a distinctive palmate structure, and its stems are usually tall and erect. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, handling the plant requires care, as all parts contain potent alkaloids.",
