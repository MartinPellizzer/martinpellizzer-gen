    "intro": "Athyrium selenopteris, commonly known as the silver-veined lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that feature striking silver veins against a deep green background. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are often used in horticultural settings for their ornamental value and adaptability to various garden conditions."
