    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. coccineum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow in autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras with winged seeds. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age.",
