It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its spadix, creating a dramatic floral display. Anthurium martae thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
