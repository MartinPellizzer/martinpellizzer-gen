    "intro": "Alnus incana subsp. incana, commonly known as gray alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its grayish bark, simple opposite leaves, and catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. It plays a significant role in ecological succession, particularly in disturbed sites. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
