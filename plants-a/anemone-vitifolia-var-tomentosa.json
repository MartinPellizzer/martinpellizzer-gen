    "intro": "Anemone vitifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly anemone, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
