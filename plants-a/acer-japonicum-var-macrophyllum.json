    "intro": "Acer japonicum var. macrophyllum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with large leaves, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking foliage, which changes color through the seasons, from vibrant green in spring to fiery red, orange, and yellow in autumn. The leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a serrated margin, reaching up to 10 centimeters in length. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This ornamental tree is widely cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes.",
