    "intro": "Adiantum braunii, commonly known as the braun's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum braunii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
