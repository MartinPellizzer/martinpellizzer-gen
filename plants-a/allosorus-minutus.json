    "intro": "Allosorus minutus, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. It is a carnivorous plant that relies on these bladders to obtain nutrients from captured prey. Allosorus minutus is often found in nutrient-poor environments, where its carnivorous adaptations provide a competitive advantage."
