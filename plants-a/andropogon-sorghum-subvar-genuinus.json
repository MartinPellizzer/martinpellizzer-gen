    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. genuinus, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short stature, typically reaching heights of 1 to 2 meters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to yellow flowers. It thrives in warm climates and is adapted to poor soil conditions, making it a resilient crop. Its botanical structure supports its use in traditional agriculture and as a forage plant for livestock."
