    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer chapaense is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This species thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often found in mixed forests and along stream banks. The plant is part of the maple family and is known for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer chapaense was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and cooler temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in certain parts of Europe and North America. The plant is commonly used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. Its introduction has been primarily for landscaping and reforestation efforts. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
