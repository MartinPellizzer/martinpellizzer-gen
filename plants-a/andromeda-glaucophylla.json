    "intro": "Andromeda glaucophylla, commonly known as the blueleaf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of western Australia. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that often have a bluish tinge, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with salt spray tolerance. Andromeda glaucophylla is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
