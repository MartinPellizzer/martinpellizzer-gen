It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often finely divided. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium subdimidiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
