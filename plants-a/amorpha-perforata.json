    "intro": "Amorpha perforata, commonly known as the slender indigo bush, is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet having a distinctive perforation, giving the plant its scientific name. Amorpha perforata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
