    "intro": "Axonopus bryoides, commonly known as the moss-like grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense, mat-like vegetation that resembles moss due to its fine, soft blades and creeping growth habit. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width, and it produces small, inconspicuous spikelets in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lawns, gardens, and along stream banks. Axonopus bryoides is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
