    "intro": "Astragalus robbinsii var. alpiniformis, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. This variety is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native ecosystems."
