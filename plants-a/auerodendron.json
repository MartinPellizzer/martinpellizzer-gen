    "intro": "Auerodendron, commonly known as the African snowball, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is native to tropical and southern Africa, where it thrives in woodland and savanna habitats. The plant is characterized by its showy, white or pink flower clusters that resemble balls, which bloom in spring. Auerodendron species are typically shrubs or small trees, with opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their attractive foliage and flowers."
