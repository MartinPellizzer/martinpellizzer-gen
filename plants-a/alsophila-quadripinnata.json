    "intro": "Alsophila quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-feather tree fern, is a tropical evergreen plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feather-like fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with multiple pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. Alsophila quadripinnata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
