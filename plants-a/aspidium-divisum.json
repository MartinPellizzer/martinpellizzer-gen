    "intro": "Aspidium divisum, commonly known as the divided wood fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure that gives the plant its common name."
