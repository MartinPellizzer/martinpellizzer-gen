    "intro": "Amauropelta pilosohispida, commonly known as the hairy-leafed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce both roots and new fronds. Its leaves are typically divided into small, lobed segments, and the undersides are covered in fine, hairy structures. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests."
