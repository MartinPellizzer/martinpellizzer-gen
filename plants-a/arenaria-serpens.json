    "intro": "Arenaria serpens, commonly known as sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
