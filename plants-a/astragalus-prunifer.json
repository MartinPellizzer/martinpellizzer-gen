It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble peach leaves, with a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Astragalus prunifer thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
