    "intro": "Arachniodes calcarata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated fronds that are often divided into narrow, finger-like segments. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
