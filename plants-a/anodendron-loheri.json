    "intro": "Anodendron loheri, commonly known as the Loher's anodendron, is a rare shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
