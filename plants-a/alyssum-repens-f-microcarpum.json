It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has compact foliage with silvery-gray leaves, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value and hardiness. The subspecies f. microcarpum is distinguished by its smaller, more numerous flowers compared to the typical form."
