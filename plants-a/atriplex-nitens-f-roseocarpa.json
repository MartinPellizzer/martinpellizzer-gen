It is characterized by its small, fleshy, pink to red berries that are clustered in spherical heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions.

The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping in suitable climates."
