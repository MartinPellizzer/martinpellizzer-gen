    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius, commonly known as tall meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Tall meadowgrass is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in traditional pastoral systems."
