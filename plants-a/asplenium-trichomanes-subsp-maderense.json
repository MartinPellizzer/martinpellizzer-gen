    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. maderense, commonly known as the Maderan shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage with lanceolate, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as limestone-rich soils in forest understories. Its fronds are usually unifacial, meaning they have a single surface with no distinct upper or lower side. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
