    "intro": "Alsophila ivohibensis, commonly known as the Ivohibena tree fern, is a species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a distinct dichotomy in its growth, with the trunk being covered in remnants of old leaf bases and the crown bearing new, vibrant fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological structure of its native habitat."
