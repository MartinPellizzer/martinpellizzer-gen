    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 wherryi, commonly known as the hybrid rock fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often adorned with small spore-producing structures called sporangia. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in rocky or wooded areas. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value, and it is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions. Asplenium \u00d7 wherryi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its resilience and aesthetic appeal."
