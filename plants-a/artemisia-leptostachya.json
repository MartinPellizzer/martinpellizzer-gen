    "intro": "Artemisia leptostachya, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical arrays. Artemisia leptostachya is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
