    "intro": "Aristida ambongensis, commonly known as the Ambong grass, is a perennial grass species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
