    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. minus, commonly known as the small moonwort, is a rare fern species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant's leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive, rounded shape that resembles a crescent moon. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or wooded areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
