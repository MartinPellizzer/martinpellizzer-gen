It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Angelica norwegica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
