    "intro": "Aeridostachya propinqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in eastern Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Aeridostachya propinqua plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
