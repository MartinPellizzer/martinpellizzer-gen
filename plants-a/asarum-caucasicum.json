    "intro": "Asarum caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its aromatic rhizomes and has been used in traditional medicine."
