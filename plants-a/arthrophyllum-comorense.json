It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, spatulate leaves and umbellate inflorescence. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Arthrophyllum comorense is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of starch."
