    "intro": "Aiouea meisneri, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native New Zealand trees. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces white or pinkish flowers that are often clustered together. The plant relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for birds and insects. However, it can be harmful to its host if it becomes too dense."
