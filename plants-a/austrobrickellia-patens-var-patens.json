    "intro": "Austrobrickellia patens var. patens, commonly known as the coastal rock melomelis, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant features narrow, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the cooler months. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
