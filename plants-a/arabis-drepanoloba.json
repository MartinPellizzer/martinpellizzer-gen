    "intro": "Arabis drepanoloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems and are arranged in clusters, adding a delicate appearance to its habitat. Arabis drepanoloba is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
