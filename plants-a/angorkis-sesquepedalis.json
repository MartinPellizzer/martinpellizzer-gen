    "intro": "Angorkis sesquepedalis, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white during the late spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a leathery texture and a pale underside. Angorkis sesquepedalis is well adapted to harsh, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at high elevations."
