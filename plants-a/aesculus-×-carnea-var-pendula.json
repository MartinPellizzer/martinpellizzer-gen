    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 carnea var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its pendulous branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces large, showy flowers in spring, which are typically pink and white, arranged in drooping clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are doubly serrated. The fruit is a spiny capsule that contains glossy, chestnut-like seeds, which are edible when processed."
