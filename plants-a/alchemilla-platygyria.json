    "intro": "Alchemilla platygyria, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties. Alchemilla platygyria thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
