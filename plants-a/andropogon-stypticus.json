    "intro": "Andropogon stypticus, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, flat leaves and tufted inflorescence that produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization. Flatleaf bluestem is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant landscapes."
