    "intro": "Acacia drepanocarpa subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are broad and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and reforestation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia drepanocarpa subsp. latifolia is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drepanocarpa subsp. latifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, often in regions where it is used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with moderate rainfall. This subspecies is particularly valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia and other regions with similar climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments."
