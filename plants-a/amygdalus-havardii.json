    "intro": "Amygdalus havardii, commonly known as the Havard almond, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, followed by almond-like fruits that are edible but not as widely cultivated as other almond varieties. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and is often found growing in crevices or on cliffs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
