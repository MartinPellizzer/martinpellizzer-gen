    "intro": "Ammannia diffusa, commonly known as prairie willow, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes and stream banks. The plant features slender, willow-like stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and are usually pink or red, attracting various pollinators. Ammannia diffusa is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
