    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbotia pumila is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically in the coastal plain regions of North and South Carolina. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This species is also present in parts of Georgia and Florida, where it grows in similar wetland habitats. It is often associated with pine flatwoods and other lowland ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive plant species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbotia pumila was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become established in several regions across the country. The plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists regarding its impact on native ecosystems."
