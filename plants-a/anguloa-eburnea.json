    "intro": "Anguloa eburnea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its pale, waxy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in late winter to early spring. Anguloa eburnea is a rare and endangered species, making it a subject of conservation interest."
