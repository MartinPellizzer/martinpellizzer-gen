    "intro": "Asclepias eastwoodiana, commonly known as Eastwood's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Asclepias eastwoodiana serves as a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
