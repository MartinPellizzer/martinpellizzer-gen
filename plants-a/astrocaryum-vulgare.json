    "intro": "Astrocaryum vulgare, commonly known as the buriti palm, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to three meters in length. The plant produces yellow to orange fruits that contain a nutrient-rich oil, making it economically important in certain regions. Its fruit is also used in traditional medicine and as a food source for both humans and animals. The buriti palm plays a significant role in the ecosystems of the Amazon rainforest."
