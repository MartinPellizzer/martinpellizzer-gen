    "intro": "Ajuga orientalis var. oblongifolia, commonly known as broadleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
