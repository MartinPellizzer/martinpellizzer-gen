    "intro": "Adiantum hexagonum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The leaves are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance, which contributes to its common name.",
