    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta brunnescens is primarily native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant typically grows in humid lowland forests and is often found in areas with rich soil and high rainfall. It is commonly associated with the Amazon rainforest and other tropical ecosystems. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in shaded understory environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta brunnescens was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils in temperate climates. It is commonly found in regions with moderate temperatures and adequate sunlight. This plant thrives in environments where there is good air circulation and minimal risk of waterlogging. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
