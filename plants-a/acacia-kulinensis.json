    "intro": "Acacia kulinensis, commonly known as the Kulin acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and produces yellow flowers in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and heathland environments. Acacia kulinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kulinensis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This species is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. It typically grows in open woodlands and heathlands. Acacia kulinensis is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other native shrubs and trees.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kulinensis was mainly introduced to South Australia and the Riverina region of New South Wales. It is commonly found in sandy soils along riverbanks and in open woodlands. The plant is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. It has also been introduced to some parts of Victoria and Queensland as part of ecological restoration efforts. However, its spread is generally limited to areas with suitable environmental conditions."
