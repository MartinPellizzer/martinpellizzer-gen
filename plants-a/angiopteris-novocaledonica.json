    "intro": "Angiopteris novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian water fern, is a tropical fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, which helps in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
