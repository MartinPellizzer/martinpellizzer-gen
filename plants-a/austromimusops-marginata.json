    "intro": "Austromimusops marginata, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has adaptations such as succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Austromimusops marginata plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
