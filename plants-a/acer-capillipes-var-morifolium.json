    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer capillipes var. morifolium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces. It thrives in cool, humid climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This variety is commonly found in mixed forests and along streamside habitats. It is well adapted to the rocky and well-drained soils typical of its native environment. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in both conservation and horticultural contexts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer capillipes var. morifolium was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, such as parts of Asia and North America. This variety is known for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage. It is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic appeal. However, it may pose a risk to native ecosystems if it spreads beyond controlled environments."
