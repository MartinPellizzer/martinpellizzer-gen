    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it is less common in modern horticulture. The variety is distinguished by its larger, more showy flower heads compared to the typical species."
