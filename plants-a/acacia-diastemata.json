    "intro": "Acacia diastemata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are typical of many Acacia species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Acacia diastemata is also valued for its hardy nature and is used in revegetation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia diastemata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with a dormant period during the wet season. Acacia diastemata plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia diastemata was mainly introduced to areas with dry to semi-arid climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. It has been introduced to parts of Africa, Asia, and Australia, where it thrives in open woodlands and savannas. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its distribution is largely driven by its adaptability and human use for fuel and timber."
