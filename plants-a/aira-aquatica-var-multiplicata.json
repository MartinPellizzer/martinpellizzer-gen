    "intro": "Aira aquatica var. multiplicata, commonly known as water airplant or marsh grass, is a variant of the water airplant species native to wetland environments. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This plant plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
