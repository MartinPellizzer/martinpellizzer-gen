    "intro": "Agathosma asperifolia, commonly known as African geranium, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a sprawling, bushy growth habit with slender, aromatic stems. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Agathosma asperifolia is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
