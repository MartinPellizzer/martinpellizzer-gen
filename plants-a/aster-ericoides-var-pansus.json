    "intro": "Aster ericoides var. pansus, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are typically prostrate or slightly ascending. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
