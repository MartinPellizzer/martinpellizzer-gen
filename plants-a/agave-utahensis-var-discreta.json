    "intro": "Agave utahensis var. discreta, commonly known as the Utah agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are often followed by a cluster of blue-gray berries. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
