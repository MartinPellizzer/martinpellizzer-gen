    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. capillare, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily and form extensive colonies. Silky bluegrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
