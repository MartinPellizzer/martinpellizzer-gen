    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. abnormis, commonly known as the broadleaf bugleweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dark green, broad, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent groundcover in suitable habitats."
