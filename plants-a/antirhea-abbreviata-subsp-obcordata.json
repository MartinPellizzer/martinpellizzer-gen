    "intro": "Antirhea abbreviata subsp. obcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf antirhea, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical rainforests, characterized by its lanceolate leaves with a distinctive acuminate tip. The flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and are borne in inflorescences at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
