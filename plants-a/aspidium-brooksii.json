    "intro": "Aspidium brooksii, commonly known as the Brooks' water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to substrates like soil or rock. Aspidium brooksii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
