    "intro": "Antiaris toxicaria subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant arrowroot, is a striking plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts can be harmful if ingested."
