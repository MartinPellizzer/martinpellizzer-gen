    "intro": "Alsine thymifolia, commonly known as thyme-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often aromatic, containing volatile oils similar to those found in thyme. Alsine thymifolia is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
