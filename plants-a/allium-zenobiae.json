    "intro": "Allium zenobiae, commonly known as the Zenobia onion, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale purple to white flowers. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are adapted to survive in cold, arid environments. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered in the wild."
