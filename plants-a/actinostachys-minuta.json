    "intro": "Actinostachys minuta, commonly known as the slender feather fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than a meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing structures called sori. The botanical features of Actinostachys minuta make it a distinctive and ecologically important component of wetland ecosystems.",
