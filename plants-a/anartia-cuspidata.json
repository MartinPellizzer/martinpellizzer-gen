    "intro": "Anartia cuspidata, commonly known as the red-banded swallowtail, is a species of butterfly found in the Americas. Its larvae feed on plants in the Apiaceae family, such as carrots and dill. The adult butterfly has striking red and black wing patterns with distinctive blue markings. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host plant for the butterfly's life cycle. This relationship highlights the ecological interdependence between plants and insect pollinators."
