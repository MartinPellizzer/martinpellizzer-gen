    "intro": "Astragalus eremiticus var. ampullarioides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
