    "intro": "Antennaria villosissima, commonly known as the silky mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its hairy leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to its environment."
