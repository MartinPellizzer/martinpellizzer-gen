    "intro": "Asplenium protovirchowii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium protovirchowii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in controlled indoor environments."
