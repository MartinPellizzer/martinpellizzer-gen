    "intro": "Asplenium medium, commonly known as the common spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces spores in spherical clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium medium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
