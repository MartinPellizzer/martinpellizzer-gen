    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. lutescens, commonly known as the golden meadowgrass, is a variant of the common meadowgrass species. It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist grasslands and meadows. The plant features slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more yellowish in the varietal form. The golden meadowgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
