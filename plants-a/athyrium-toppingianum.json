    "intro": "Athyrium toppingianum, commonly known as the Topping's lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
