    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. fissurae, commonly known as the fissured monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in tall, sparsely branched inflorescences. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in woodland or alpine habitats. Like other members of the Aconitum genus, it contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle or ingest.",
