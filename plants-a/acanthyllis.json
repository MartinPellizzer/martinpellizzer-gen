    "intro": "Acanthyllis, commonly known as the needle grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. They are characterized by their erect, often spiny stems and small, needle-like leaves. Acanthyllis species produce daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk, often in shades of yellow or white. The genus includes over 100 species, many of which are adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
