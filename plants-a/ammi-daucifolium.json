    "intro": "Ammi daucifolium, commonly known as wild carrot or bishop's weed, is a biennial or annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a taproot that is usually not cultivated for food but is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
