    "intro": "Agropyron latiglume, commonly known as the tough glume grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its sturdy, fibrous stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and\u575a\u97e7, with a prominent midrib, and its seeds are enclosed in tough, glabrous glumes. Agropyron latiglume is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
