    "intro": "Allium bisceptrum, commonly known as the double-headed onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence that bears clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that serve as storage organs for nutrients, typical of the Allium genus. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Allium bisceptrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
