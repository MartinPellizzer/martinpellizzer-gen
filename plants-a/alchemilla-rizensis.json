    "intro": "Alchemilla rizensis, commonly known as the Ryzens alkanet, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers contain compounds similar to those found in other members of the alchemilla genus, which have historically been used in herbal remedies. Alchemilla rizensis is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments."
