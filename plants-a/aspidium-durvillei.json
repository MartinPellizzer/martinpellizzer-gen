    "intro": "Aspidium durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Madagascar and parts of East Africa. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Aspidium durvillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
