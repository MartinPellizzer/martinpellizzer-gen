    "intro": "Androphylax scandens, commonly known as the climbing androphylax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its twining stems that climb along other vegetation, often found in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a slightly hairy surface. Androphylax scandens is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
