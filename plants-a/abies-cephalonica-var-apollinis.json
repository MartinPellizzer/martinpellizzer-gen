    "intro": "Abies cephalonica var. apollinis, commonly known as the Apollo fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of Greece. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of its parent species. The cones are typically small and upright, with a distinctive reddish-brown coloration. This variety thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat loss.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica var. apollinis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the Greek island of Kefalonia. This variant of the Cephalonian fir is found in the higher elevations of the island, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. It is commonly located in the forests of the Panachaiko and Dafni mountains. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of this region, including rocky soils and frequent mist. Its distribution is limited to this specific area, making it a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica var. apollinis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly in regions with temperate climates. This variety is favored for its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it is important to note that its introduction may have ecological implications in non-native environments. Its cultivation is often limited to specific areas where it can be maintained without causing harm to local ecosystems."
