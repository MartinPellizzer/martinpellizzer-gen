It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization in harsh environments. Its resilience to drought and high salinity allows it to thrive where many other plants cannot. Anabasis balchaschensis plays an important ecological role in desert ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for local wildlife."
