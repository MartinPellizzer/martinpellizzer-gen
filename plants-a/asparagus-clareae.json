    "intro": "Asparagus clareae, commonly known as the desert asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, jointed stems that often branch into clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and adapted to store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Asparagus clareae is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
