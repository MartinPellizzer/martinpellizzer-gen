It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically rounded and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
