    "intro": "Ajuga pallescens, commonly known as silver ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Europe. It features dense clusters of small, dark blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful ground cover in gardens."
