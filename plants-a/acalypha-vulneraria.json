This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is commonly found in forests, shrublands, and along riverbanks. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it plays an important role in the biodiversity of Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha vulneraria was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread across various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local ecosystems."
