    "intro": "Andira frondosa var. longifoliolata, commonly known as the long-leaved andira, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical applications remain under study."
