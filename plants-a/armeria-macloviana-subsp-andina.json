    "intro": "Armeria macloviana subsp. andina, commonly known as the Andean thrift, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces dense clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant thrives in cool, rocky environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with strong sunlight and limited soil. Its foliage consists of linear, fleshy leaves that help conserve moisture in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny soils."
