    "intro": "Amphicarpum, commonly known as the \"double-seeded grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its unique reproductive strategy, producing two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground. The above-ground seeds are typically dispersed by wind, while the underground seeds can remain dormant for extended periods. This adaptation allows Amphicarpum to thrive in disturbed soils and environments with fluctuating conditions. The genus includes several species that are found across various habitats, from grasslands to arid regions."
