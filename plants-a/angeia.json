    "intro": "Angeia, commonly known as the blue angel, is a striking member of the Malvaceae family, native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep blue to violet, often with a contrasting white or pink throat. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, adding to its ornamental appeal. Angeia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
