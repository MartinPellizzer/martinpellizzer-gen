    "intro": "Alisma natans var. sparganiifolium, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the mud. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats on the water."
