    "intro": "Amerimnon duperreanum, commonly known as the Peruvian lily, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, and it produces a distinctive, fragrant bloom during the spring and summer seasons. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
