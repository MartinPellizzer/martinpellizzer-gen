    "intro": "Atalanthus, commonly known as the fairy lantern or desert broom, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Atalanthus species are characterized by their upright growth habit, small compound leaves, and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The fruits are distinctive, resembling small lanterns, which is why the plant is also called the fairy lantern. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems and reduced water loss mechanisms."
