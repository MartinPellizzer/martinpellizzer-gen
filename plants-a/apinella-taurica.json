    "intro": "Apinella taurica, commonly known as the Tauric apinella, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Tauric Chersonese region of Crimea. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical species."
