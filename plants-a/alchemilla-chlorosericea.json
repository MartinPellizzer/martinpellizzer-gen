It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a silvery-white underside, giving it a distinctive appearance.

It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens with wet or damp soil conditions."
