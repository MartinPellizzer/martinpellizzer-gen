    "intro": "Annona palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the Caribbean. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in humid, lowland areas. The plant produces large, showy flowers with a fragrant aroma, which are followed by fruit that resembles a custard apple in texture and taste. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a smooth surface and a waxy coating. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is not as widely cultivated as other annona species."
