    "intro": "Alsophila ichtyolepis, commonly known as the fish-scale tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, light-green fronds that give it a delicate appearance. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its slow growth rate and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
