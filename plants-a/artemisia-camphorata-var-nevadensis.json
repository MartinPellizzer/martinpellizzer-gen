    "intro": "Artemisia camphorata var. nevadensis, commonly known as mountain wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including camphor, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in herbal remedies and as a companion plant in xeriscaping."
