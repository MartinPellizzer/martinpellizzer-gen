    "intro": "Arctium pugioniferum, commonly known as the heartweed or common burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in waste areas. Arctium pugioniferum is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
