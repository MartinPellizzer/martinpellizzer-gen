    "intro": "Avena subulata, commonly known as the slender oat, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, cylindrical seeds. Avena subulata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
