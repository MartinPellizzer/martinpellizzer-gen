    "intro": "Adenostegia maritima, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation across coastal dunes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Adenostegia maritima plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",
