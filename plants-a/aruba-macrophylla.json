    "intro": "Aruba macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf arum, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, spadix-bearing inflorescence. Native to the Caribbean, it thrives in humid, warm climates with high light exposure. The plant's foliage is often a deep green with a waxy texture, while its flowers resemble those of a calla lily. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic appearance and ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Aruba macrophylla is also noted for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
