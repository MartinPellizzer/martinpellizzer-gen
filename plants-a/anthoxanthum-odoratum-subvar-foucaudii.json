    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum subvar. foucaudii, commonly known as the sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and tufted inflorescences that produce small, golden-yellow to reddish spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a grassy aroma when crushed. This subspecies is often distinguished by its pale green to bluish-green foliage and its ability to thrive in poor soils."
