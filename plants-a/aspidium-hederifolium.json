    "intro": "Aspidium hederifolium, commonly known as the ivy fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and its ability to form dense, mat-like growths on rocky or shaded surfaces. The fronds are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments, giving the plant a lacy appearance. It prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Aspidium hederifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
