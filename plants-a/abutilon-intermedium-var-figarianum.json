    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon intermedium var. figarianum is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, particularly the Bahamas, Cuba, and the Greater Antilles. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is commonly found in sandy soils along the shorelines. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be seen growing in dune environments. The species is also known to occur in parts of southern Florida. Its native range is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon intermedium var. figarianum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and plant enthusiasts seeking to diversify local landscapes. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying environments and posing ecological risks."
