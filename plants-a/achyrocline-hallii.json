It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a disc-like structure, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
