    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet with three florets, giving it its common name. This grass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
