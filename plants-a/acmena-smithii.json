    "intro": "Acmena smithii, commonly known as the silky oaks, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by woody, edible pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular ornamental plant in subtropical and temperate regions. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a valuable species for reforestation and erosion control.",
