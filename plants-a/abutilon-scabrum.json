    "intro": "Abutilon scabrum, commonly known as the rough abutilon, is a perennial shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has a woody stem with a rough, scaly texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Abutilon scabrum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon scabrum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, including parts of Central and South America. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Mexico. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with coastal areas and disturbed soils. It is also known to grow in dry forests and savannas where it can tolerate varying levels of sunlight. Its native range extends into some Caribbean islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon scabrum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through human activity, such as accidental transport on ships or intentional planting for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns. It is now found in various habitats across the islands, including coastal areas and dry forests. Efforts are ongoing to monitor and control its spread to protect native ecosystems."
