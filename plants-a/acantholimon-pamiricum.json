This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these countries, particularly in the Pamir and Hindu Kush ranges. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. The species is adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its native habitat. It plays a role in the local biodiversity of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon pamiricum was mainly introduced to areas with high altitudes and arid conditions, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it suitable for harsh environments. It is commonly found in the Pamir Mountains and surrounding regions of Central Asia. Its introduction has been noted in ecological studies focusing on alpine flora and plant adaptation strategies."
