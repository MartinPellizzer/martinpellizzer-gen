    "intro": "Acer palmatum subsp. palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that display a range of colors throughout the growing season, from bright green to vibrant red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet, with a rounded or conical shape. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves unfold in spring. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.",
