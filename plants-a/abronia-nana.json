    "intro": "Abronia nana, commonly known as the dwarf sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. Abronia nana is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia nana is primarily native to Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. This small flowering plant is commonly found in rocky and sandy soils across these western U.S. states. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in crevices or on slopes. The species is part of the purslane family and is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the southwestern deserts. Its limited distribution reflects its specific ecological requirements and geographic range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia nana was mainly introduced to the coastal dunes and sandy soils of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in well-drained, sunny environments with minimal water retention. The plant is commonly found in areas with moderate temperatures and low precipitation. Its introduction has been documented in several states including Oregon and Washington. However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and is often monitored for potential ecological impacts."
