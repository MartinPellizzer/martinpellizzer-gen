    "intro": "Alstroemeria rupestris, commonly known as the rock alstroemeria, is a flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting darker veins. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically evergreen. Alstroemeria rupestris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its resilience in arid or coastal environments."
