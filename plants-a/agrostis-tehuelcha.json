    "intro": "Agrostis tehuelcha, commonly known as the Tehuelche grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid environments. Agrostis tehuelcha is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh climates."
