    "intro": "Arabis mollis subsp. mollis, commonly known as silverleaf rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features basal rosettes of silver-gray, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
