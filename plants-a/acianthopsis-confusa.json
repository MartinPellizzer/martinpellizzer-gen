    "intro": "Acianthopsis confusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale green to white flowers. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts.",
