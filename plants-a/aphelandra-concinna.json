    "intro": "Aphelandra concinna, commonly known as the golden flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are dark green with a metallic sheen and bright yellow veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra concinna is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
