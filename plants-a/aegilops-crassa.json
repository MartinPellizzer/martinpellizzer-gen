    "intro": "Aegilops crassa, commonly known as rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its coarse, dark green leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with bract-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Aegilops crassa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and rapid growth. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
