    "intro": "Avena macilenta, commonly known as the slender oat, is a species of grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces small, cylindrical spikelets that contain the reproductive structures. Avena macilenta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
