    "intro": "Abies webbiana var. pindrow, commonly known as the Pindrow fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the western Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The cones are typically pendulous and can reach lengths of up to 15 centimeters. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at high altitudes. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies webbiana var. pindrow is primarily native to the western Himalayas, including regions in northern India, western Nepal, and parts of eastern Afghanistan. It is commonly found in high-altitude forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. This variety is particularly associated with the Pindari and Kumaon regions, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. It is often found growing in mixed coniferous forests alongside other species such as Picea and Pinus. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these mountainous areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies webbiana var. pindrow was mainly introduced to the western regions of North America, particularly in the mountainous areas of California and Oregon. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. This variety is often planted in gardens and as a landscape tree because of its hardiness and adaptability to different soil types. However, it has also been observed spreading into natural habitats, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to discussions about its role in both horticulture and ecological management."
