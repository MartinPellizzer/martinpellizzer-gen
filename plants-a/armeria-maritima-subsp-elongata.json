It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense, mat-like clusters of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant plant suitable for coastal gardens and erosion control."
