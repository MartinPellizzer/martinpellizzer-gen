    "intro": "Astragalus saximontanus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and dry, open habitats, such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus saximontanus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
