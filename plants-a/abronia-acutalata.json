    "intro": "Abronia acutalata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its narrow, linear leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited for drought conditions. Abronia acutalata is often found in open habitats such as dunes, plains, and rocky slopes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia acutalata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with mild, coastal climates. This species is commonly found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it can receive adequate sunlight and drainage. It is an annual plant that blooms with small, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, Abronia acutalata is considered a rare and endangered species in some parts of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia acutalata was mainly introduced to new habitats in the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral ecosystems. The plant's introduction has been linked to human activity, including landscaping and accidental transport through trade. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original range, sometimes becoming invasive in certain areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its distribution and prevent ecological disruption."
