    "intro": "Acer macrophyllum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the Oregon maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a distinctive white or silver underside. The tree produces small, red or orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas along the coastal regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",
