    "intro": "Astragalus piscinus, commonly known as water milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is typically fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus piscinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
