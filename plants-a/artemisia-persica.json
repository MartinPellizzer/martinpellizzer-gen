    "intro": "Artemisia persica, commonly known as Persian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silver-gray leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent due to its high content of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Artemisia persica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
