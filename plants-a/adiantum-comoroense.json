    "intro": "Adiantum comoroense, commonly known as the Comoro maidenhair fern, is a species of polypod fern native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.",
