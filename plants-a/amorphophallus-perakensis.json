    "intro": "Amorphophallus perakensis, commonly known as the Bornean giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the freshwater habitats of Borneo. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can span over two meters in diameter, providing a unique canopy over the water. The plant's flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats that can influence local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
