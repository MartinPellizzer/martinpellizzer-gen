    "intro": "Albizia julibrissin var. mollis, commonly known as the Chinese silk tree or silk velvet acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, fluffy pink or white flower clusters that resemble silk ribbons, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
