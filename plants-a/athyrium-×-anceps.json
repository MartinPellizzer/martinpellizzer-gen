    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 anceps, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium niponicum and Athyrium filix-femina. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a light green to bluish-green coloration. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium \u00d7 anceps is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
