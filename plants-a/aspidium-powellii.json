    "intro": "Aspidium powellii, commonly known as Powell's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. The spores are released from the sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds, facilitating reproduction in moist habitats."
