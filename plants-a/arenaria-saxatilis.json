    "intro": "Arenaria saxatilis, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing, perennial flowering plant native to rocky and coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, helping to conserve moisture in arid environments. Arenaria saxatilis is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens."
