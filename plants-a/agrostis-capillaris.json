    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems that are often less than 30 cm in height, with fine, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis capillaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
