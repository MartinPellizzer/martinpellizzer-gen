    "intro": "Alchemilla argyrophylla f. bakeri, commonly known as the silverleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
