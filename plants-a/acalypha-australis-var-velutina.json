    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha australis var. velutina is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This variant is adapted to temperate climates and is typically found in open habitats such as woodlands and heathlands. It is also known to occur in some regions of southern Victoria. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha australis var. velutina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial period. It has since naturalized in some regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
