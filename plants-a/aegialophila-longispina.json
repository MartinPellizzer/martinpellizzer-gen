    "intro": "Aegialophila longispina, commonly known as the long-spined sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, spiny leaves that provide protection against grazing. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in sandy or rocky coastal soils. Aegialophila longispina plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
