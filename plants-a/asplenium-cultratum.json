    "intro": "Asplenium cultratum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that resemble a sword. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures include sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium cultratum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
