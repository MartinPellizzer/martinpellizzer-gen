    "intro": "Anthemis membranacea, commonly known as the desert gum plant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive, aromatic scent. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters called capitula. The species is well adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions."
