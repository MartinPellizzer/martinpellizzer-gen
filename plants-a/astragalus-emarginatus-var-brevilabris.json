    "intro": "Astragalus emarginatus var. brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions. It is often found in open habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
