    "intro": "Allium pelagicum, commonly known as the sea garlic, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty, coastal environments. Its bulbous structure stores nutrients and water, aiding survival in harsh conditions. Allium pelagicum is often used in local cuisine and traditional medicine."
