    "intro": "Asemeia acuminata, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals, is a distinguishing feature of the species. Asemeia acuminata plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
