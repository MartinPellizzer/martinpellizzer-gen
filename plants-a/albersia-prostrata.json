    "intro": "Albersia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate albersia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and often showy blooms. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate moisture conditions."
