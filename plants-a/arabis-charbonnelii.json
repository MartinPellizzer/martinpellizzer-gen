It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. This species is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring.

Its small, pinnately divided leaves and delicate appearance make it a distinctive member of its ecological community."
