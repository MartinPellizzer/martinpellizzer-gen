    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. decorticatus, commonly known as the naked asparagus, is a variant of the common asparagus that lacks the typical spiny, leafy sheaths. This plant is characterized by its slender, green stems that emerge directly from the ground without the protective leaf layers found in other asparagus varieties. It is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated for its edible shoots, which are harvested in the spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens with warm climates. Its botanical features make it a unique and valuable addition to both ornamental and culinary gardens."
