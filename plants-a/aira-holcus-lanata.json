    "intro": "Aira holcus-lanata, commonly known as soft brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in dense spikelets, which are typically arranged in a panicle inflorescence. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
