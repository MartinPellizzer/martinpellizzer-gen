    "intro": "Afrardisia mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumbensis fern, is a rare and endemic species found in the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dense undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to habitat loss and limited study, Afrardisia mayumbensis remains a poorly understood and critically endangered plant."
