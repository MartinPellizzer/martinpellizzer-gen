    "intro": "Acer coriaceifolium subsp. obscurilobum, commonly known as the dark-lobed maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with dark green upper surfaces and lighter, sometimes hairy, undersides. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer coriaceifolium subsp. obscurilobum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This subspecies thrives in temperate to subtropical climates, often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. The plant is part of the maple family and is known for its distinctive, lobed leaves and ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer coriaceifolium subsp. obscurilobum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous or hilly landscapes. This subspecies is known for its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and slower growth rate."
