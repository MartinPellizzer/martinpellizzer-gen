    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. palauensis is primarily native to the Palau archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. This species is found throughout the island group, particularly in lowland and coastal areas. It thrives in moist, tropical environments with high humidity and partial shade. The plant is commonly observed in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its native range is limited to the Micronesian island of Palau.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. palauensis was mainly introduced to Palau as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to tropical climates. It has since become established in various habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed sites. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in different soil types have contributed to its spread across the island. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Despite its aesthetic value, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent it from becoming invasive."
