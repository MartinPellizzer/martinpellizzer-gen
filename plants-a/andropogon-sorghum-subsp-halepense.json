    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subsp. halepense, commonly known as jointvetch, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically green or pale yellow. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
