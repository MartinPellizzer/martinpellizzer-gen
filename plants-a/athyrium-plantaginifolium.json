    "intro": "Athyrium plantaginifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved forest fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is a perennial fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, broad, and acuminate shape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds."
