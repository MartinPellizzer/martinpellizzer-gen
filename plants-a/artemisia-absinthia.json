    "intro": "Artemisia absinthia, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features gray-green, aromatic foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its essential oils, particularly thujone, contribute to its historical use in absinthe and traditional medicine."
