    "intro": "Aspidium decrescens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a fern species native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce dense colonies. The fronds are typically pinnate, with a dark green, leathery texture and a distinctive, shield-like appearance on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, dense foliage."
