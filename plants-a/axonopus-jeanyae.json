    "intro": "Axonopus jeanyae, commonly known as the Jeany's axonopus, is a species of grass native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes many other grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowering structure consists of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Axonopus jeanyae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
