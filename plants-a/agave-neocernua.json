    "intro": "Agave neocernua, commonly known as the ghost agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and its striking, bluish-gray foliage with a waxy texture. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Agave neocernua is also noted for its ability to form offsets, which can be used for propagation."
