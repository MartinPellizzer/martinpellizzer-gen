    "intro": "Acer sinense var. iatrophifolium, commonly known as the dark-leaf maple, is a variant of the Chinese maple characterized by its distinctive dark green, almost black foliage. It is a deciduous tree native to China, typically growing in forested areas with moist, well-drained soil. The leaves are palmately lobed, with a glossy surface that becomes more pronounced in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking autumn color.",
