    "intro": "Aspidium lonchitis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, elongated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium lonchitis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
