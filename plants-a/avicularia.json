    "intro": "Avicularia, commonly known as the moon jellyfish, is a species of jellyfish belonging to the family Pelagiiidae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent bell that can range in color from pale blue to greenish hues. The plant-like structure of Avicularia is composed of a gelatinous mesoglea layer, which provides structural support. It lacks true roots, stems, or leaves, instead relying on specialized structures for feeding and reproduction. Its life cycle includes both a sessile polyp stage and a free-swimming medusa stage."
