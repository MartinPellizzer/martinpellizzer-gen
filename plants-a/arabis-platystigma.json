    "intro": "Arabis platystigma, commonly known as the broad-stemmed rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other well-known plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in early spring. Arabis platystigma is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature."
