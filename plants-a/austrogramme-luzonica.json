    "intro": "Austrogramme luzonica, commonly known as the Luzon austrogramme, is a rare flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its small, capsule-like fruits contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss, Austrogramme luzonica is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
