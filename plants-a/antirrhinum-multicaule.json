It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of showy, two-lipped flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early autumn, producing numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its root system is fibrous and shallow. Antirrhinum multicaule is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
