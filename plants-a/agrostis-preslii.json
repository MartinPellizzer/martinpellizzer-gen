    "intro": "Agrostis preslii, commonly known as Preslia's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically forms dense mats on dry, open ground, often in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh environments, making it a hardy species. Its botanical features make it an important component of certain ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
