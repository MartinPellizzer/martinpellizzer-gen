    "intro": "Angiopteris opaca, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its large, intricate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that produce new fronds. Its fronds are divided into pinnae, which are further subdivided into pinnules, creating a feathery appearance. Angiopteris opaca thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
