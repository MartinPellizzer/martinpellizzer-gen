    "intro": "Anemia carvifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface, and produces showy white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its flowers are composed of numerous petal-like sepals, and it is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early blooming display."
