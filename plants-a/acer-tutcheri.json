    "intro": "Acer tutcheri, commonly known as the Tutcher's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
