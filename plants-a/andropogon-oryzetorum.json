    "intro": "Andropogon oryzetorum, commonly known as common bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its blue-green foliage and tufted inflorescences, which are typically spike-like in structure. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization and erosion control. Andropogon oryzetorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
