    "intro": "Azalea micrantha, commonly known as the dwarf azalea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Azalea micrantha is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded borders due to its preference for acidic, well-drained soil."
