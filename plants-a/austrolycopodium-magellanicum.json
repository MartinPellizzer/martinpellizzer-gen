    "intro": "Austrolycopodium magellanicum, commonly known as the Magellanic clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen plant native to southern South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of its ancient lineage of vascular plants. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its historical significance lies in its role as a relict species from the Carboniferous period."
