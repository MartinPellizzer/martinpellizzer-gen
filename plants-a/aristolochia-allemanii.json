It features heart-shaped leaves and produces unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-brown with a strong, aromatic odor. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to twine around supports, making it a popular ornamental in gardens. However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered invasive in some regions. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially hazardous."
