    "intro": "Aster mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican aster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its showy, violet-blue to purple flowers bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Aster mexicanus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
