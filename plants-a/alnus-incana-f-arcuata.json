It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil, and it serves as a habitat for various wildlife species. The foliage and seed cones are typically harvested for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
