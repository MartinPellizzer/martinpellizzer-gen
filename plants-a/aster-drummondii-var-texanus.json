    "intro": "Aster drummondii var. texanus, commonly known as the Texas aster, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
