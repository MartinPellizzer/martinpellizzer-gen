    "intro": "Ambora alternifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf fern, is a perennial plant native to tropical regions. It features delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant grows in a clumping habit, with rhizomes spreading horizontally to form dense colonies. Its leaves are alternate, meaning they grow singly along the stem, each with a distinct, lance-shaped form. Ambora alternifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant appearance."
