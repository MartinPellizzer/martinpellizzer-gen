    "intro": "Amelanchier laevis f. villosa, commonly known as the hairy serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy leaves, which give it its specific epithet \"villosa,\" meaning hairy in Latin. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or open areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
