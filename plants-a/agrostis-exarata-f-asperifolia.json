    "intro": "Agrostis exarata f. asperifolia, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a variant of the species Agrostis exarata, characterized by its rough, hairy leaves. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive rough texture, which is a key feature of the asperifolia form. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This grass is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and as forage for livestock."
