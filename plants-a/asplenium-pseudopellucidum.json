    "intro": "Asplenium pseudopellucidum, commonly known as the translucent holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a translucent or waxy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are often distinguishable from the sterile ones. Asplenium pseudopellucidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
