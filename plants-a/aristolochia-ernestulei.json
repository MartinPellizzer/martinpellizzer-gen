    "intro": "Aristolochia ernestulei, commonly known as Ernest's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the humid lowland forests of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are often twisted and have a distinctive, heart-shaped structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that are edible but contain toxic compounds. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
