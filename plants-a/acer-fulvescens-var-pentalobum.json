    "intro": "Acer fulvescens var. pentalobum, commonly known as the red maple variant with five lobes, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five distinct lobes, and are opposite in arrangement. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The tree thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions.",
