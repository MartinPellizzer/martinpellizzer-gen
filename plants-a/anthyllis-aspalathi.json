    "intro": "Anthyllis aspalathi, commonly known as the spring gentian, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, trifoliate leaves are adapted to conserve moisture, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that disperse its seeds. Anthyllis aspalathi is often found in alpine and coastal areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these unique ecosystems."
