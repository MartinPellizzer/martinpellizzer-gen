It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in summer, often with a faint pink or purple tint at the base. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often woody. Aporosa illustris is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
