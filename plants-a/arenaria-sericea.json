    "intro": "Arenaria sericea, commonly known as silver sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Arenaria sericea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
