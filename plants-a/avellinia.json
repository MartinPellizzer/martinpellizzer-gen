    "intro": "Avellinia, commonly known as the hazelnut tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Betulaceae. It consists of several species, with Avellinia cineraria being the most well-known. These plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The fruit is a nut enclosed in a husk, which develops from the female flowers. Avellinia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are valued for their edible nuts and ornamental qualities."
