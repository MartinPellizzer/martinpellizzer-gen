    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon paeoniiflorum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with forest understories or cultivated gardens. It is known for its showy, lantern-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other parts of the world, but its native range remains concentrated in Southeast Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon paeoniiflorum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, peony-like flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of climates. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is often used as a decorative shrub or small tree, adding visual interest with its vibrant blooms. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, where it can sometimes become invasive. Despite its aesthetic appeal, care must be taken to prevent its spread beyond controlled environments."
