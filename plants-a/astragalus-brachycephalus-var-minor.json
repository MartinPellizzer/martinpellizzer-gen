It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor environments. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and potential medicinal properties."
