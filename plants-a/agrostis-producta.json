    "intro": "Agrostis producta, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Agrostis producta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its fine texture and durability."
