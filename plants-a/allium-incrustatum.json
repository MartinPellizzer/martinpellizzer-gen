    "intro": "Allium incrustatum, commonly known as the rock onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a dense cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or purple flowers in umbels. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy bulbs that are often covered in a layer of dry, papery skin. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Allium incrustatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
