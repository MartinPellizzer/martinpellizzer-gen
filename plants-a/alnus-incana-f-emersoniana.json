    "intro": "Alnus incana f. emersoniana, commonly known as the gray alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its grayish-brown bark and small, simple leaves that are usually alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically wind-pollinated, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in riparian zones and is valued for its ability to stabilize stream banks. This subspecies is also noted for its role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
