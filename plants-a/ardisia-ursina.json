It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. These berries are edible but are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Ardisia ursina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
