    "intro": "Alnus incana var. argentata, commonly known as silver alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streams, wetlands, and other riparian areas. It has small, catkin-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and it produces small, winged seeds. This species is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
