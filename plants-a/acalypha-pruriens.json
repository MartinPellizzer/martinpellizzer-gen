It is also found in parts of Africa, including Nigeria and Kenya, as well as in the Pacific Islands like Papua New Guinea. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native distribution includes a wide range of geographic areas across the tropics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pruriens was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has been widely cultivated in areas such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas. The plant is often used in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant leaves and unique appearance. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not properly managed. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential ecological impact in non-native habitats."
