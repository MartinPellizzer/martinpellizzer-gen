It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
