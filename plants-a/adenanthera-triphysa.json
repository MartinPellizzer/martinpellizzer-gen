    "intro": "Adenanthera triphysa, commonly known as the three-lobed burr. It is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive three-lobed fruit pods that enclose the seeds. The seeds are encased in a hard, spiky shell, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It is often grown as a forage plant and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits.",
