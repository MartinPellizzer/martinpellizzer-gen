    "intro": "Arundinella montana, commonly known as the mountain reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to yellowish flowers during the spring and early summer. Arundinella montana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
