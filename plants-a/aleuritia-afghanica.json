    "intro": "Aleuritia afghanica, commonly known as the Afghan snowberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for birds and some mammals, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Aleuritia afghanica thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine zones. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens in temperate climates."
