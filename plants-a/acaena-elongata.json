This plant is commonly found in the Andean regions and surrounding areas of these countries. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and disturbed soils. Acaena elongata is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across Central and South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena elongata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now commonly found in various habitats across the country. It is particularly prevalent in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
