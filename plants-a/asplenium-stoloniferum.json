    "intro": "Asplenium stoloniferum, commonly known as the wandering spleen, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread horizontally across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium stoloniferum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
