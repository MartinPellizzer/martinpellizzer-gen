    "intro": "Anthurium mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican flame or red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped, bright red spathes that enclose the spadix, a central flowering structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically hidden within the spathe. Its leaves are large, glossy, and arrowhead-shaped, adding to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium mexicanum thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth."
