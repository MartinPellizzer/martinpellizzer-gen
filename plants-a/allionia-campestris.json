    "intro": "Allionia campestris, commonly known as the field garlic, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to onions, which are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb. Allionia campestris thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is known for its strong garlic-like aroma and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
