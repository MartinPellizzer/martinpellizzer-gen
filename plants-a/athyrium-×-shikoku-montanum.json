    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 shikoku-montanum, commonly known as the Japanese forest fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Athyrium shikokianum and Athyrium montanum. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that typically measure 30\u201360 cm in length, with a bipinnate structure that gives it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments, often found in forests and along stream banks in its native range. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
