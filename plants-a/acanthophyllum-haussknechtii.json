    "intro": "Acanthophyllum haussknechtii, commonly known as the sandmat, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and spiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are adapted to attract pollinators in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited rainfall. Acanthophyllum haussknechtii plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion in its native habitat.",

It is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often in areas with low precipitation. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological zones of Iran's interior deserts and steppe regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum haussknechtii was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils, often in desert steppes and dunes. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low precipitation. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
