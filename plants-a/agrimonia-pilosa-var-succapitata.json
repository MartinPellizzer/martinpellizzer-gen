    "intro": "Agrimonia pilosa var. succapitata, commonly known as the scarlet agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, with opposite, pinnately compound leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces bright red to orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its roots are fibrous and can form a dense mat, making it a hardy plant that thrives in well-drained soils. Agrimony is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, and it has been historically used in herbal medicine."
