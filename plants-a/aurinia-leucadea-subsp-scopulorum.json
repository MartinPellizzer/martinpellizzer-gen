    "intro": "Aurinia leucadea subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on limestone or sandstone substrates. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cold, nutrient-poor conditions typical of mountainous regions."
