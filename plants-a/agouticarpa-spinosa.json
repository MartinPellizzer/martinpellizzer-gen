    "intro": "Agouticarpa spinosa, commonly known as the spiny agouti fruit, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, spiny fruits that resemble the seeds of the agouti rodent. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange berries, which are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture and a strong aromatic scent. Agouticarpa spinosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
