    "intro": "Asclepias armata, commonly known as the Texas milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous tiny, fluffy seeds attached to silky parachutes, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias armata is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Its fibrous roots make it drought-tolerant and well adapted to arid environments."
