    "intro": "Asplenium ocanniense, commonly known as the Ocani's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium ocanniense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
