    "intro": "Agrostis signata, commonly known as the pink oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, pinkish or pale purple flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence is a panicle, which is a branched cluster of spikelets. Agrostis signata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
