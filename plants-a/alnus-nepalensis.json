    "intro": "Alnus nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the Betulaceae family. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across mountainous terrain. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,500 meters. Alnus nepalensis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
