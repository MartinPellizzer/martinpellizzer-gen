    "intro": "Arrojadoa dinae subsp. eriocaulis, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy or swampy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is an important species in wetland ecosystems."
