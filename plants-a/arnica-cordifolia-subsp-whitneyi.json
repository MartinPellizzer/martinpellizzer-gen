    "intro": "Arnica cordifolia subsp. whitneyi, commonly known as Whitney's heartleaf arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
