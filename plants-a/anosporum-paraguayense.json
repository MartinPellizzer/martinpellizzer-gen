    "intro": "Anosporum paraguayense, commonly known as the Paraguay spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, feather-like fronds that are often clustered together, and it produces spores rather than seeds. It is native to South America, particularly Paraguay and Brazil, and thrives in shaded, moist conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
