    "intro": "Ardisia premnifolia, commonly known as the glossy woodbine, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
