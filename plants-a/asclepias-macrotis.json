    "intro": "Asclepias macrotis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Asclepias macrotis plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly monarch butterflies, which rely on its flowers and seeds for sustenance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
