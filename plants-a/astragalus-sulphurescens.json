    "intro": "Astragalus sulphurescens, commonly known as the sulfur-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that resemble those of the genus Astragalus. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, compound leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus sulphurescens is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems."
