    "intro": "Aegilops crassa subsp. trivialis, commonly known as the broad-leaved wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage and distinctive, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
