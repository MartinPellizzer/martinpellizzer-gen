    "intro": "Aspidium falcatum var. fortunei, commonly known as the Fortune's water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions such as China and Japan. The plant features delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically semi-aquatic, thriving in moist or aquatic environments. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to wet soil or aquatic substrates. The spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
