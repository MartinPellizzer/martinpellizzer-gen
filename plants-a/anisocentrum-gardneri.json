    "intro": "Anisocentrum gardneri, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a succulent-like appearance with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anisocentrum gardneri is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it a resilient and visually striking plant in its native habitat."
