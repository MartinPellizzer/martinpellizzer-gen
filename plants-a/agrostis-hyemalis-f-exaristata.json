    "intro": "Agrostis hyemalis f. exaristata, commonly known as the hairy winter bentgrass, is a variant of the winter bentgrass species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with small, spikelet-like flowers. This form is notable for its hairy texture on the leaves, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Agrostis."
