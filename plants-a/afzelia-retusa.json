    "intro": "Afzelia retusa, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a tropical tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood that is highly valued for its strength and aesthetic appeal. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by elongated pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
