    "intro": "Aleuritopteris grayi, commonly known as the Gray's shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
