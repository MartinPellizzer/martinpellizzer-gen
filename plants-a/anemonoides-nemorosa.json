    "intro": "Anemonoides nemorosa, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with five petals. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of pubescence. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in well-drained, loamy soil. The flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, making it a notable early indicator plant in forest ecosystems."
