    "intro": "Astragalus scapiger, commonly known as the scapose milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright, sparsely branched stems and small, yellow to pale green pea-like flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus scapiger is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
