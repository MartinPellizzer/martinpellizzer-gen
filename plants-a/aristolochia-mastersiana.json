    "intro": "Aristolochia mastersiana, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central America. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves that are often veined with white or pale green. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their strong odor. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals, making it a subject of both botanical interest and caution."
