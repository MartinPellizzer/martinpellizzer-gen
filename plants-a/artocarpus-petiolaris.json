    "intro": "Artocarpus petiolaris, commonly known as the beach breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used for roofing in traditional architecture. The tree produces a distinctive fruit with a thick, fibrous outer layer and a soft, starchy interior. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline conditions, making it an important species for coastal reforestation. The plant has both ecological and cultural significance in the regions where it is found."
