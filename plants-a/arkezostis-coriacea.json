    "intro": "Arkezostis coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Arkezostis coriacea is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
