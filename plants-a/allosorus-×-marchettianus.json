    "intro": "Allosorus \u00d7 marchettianus, commonly known as the hybrid marsh orchid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Allosorus filiformis and Allosorus rupicola. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the Orchidaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in certain regions."
