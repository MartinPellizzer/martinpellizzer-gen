    "intro": "Agave peacockii, commonly known as the peacock agave, is a striking succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and long, bluish-green leaves that are adorned with distinctive white and green variegation. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Agave peacockii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping."
