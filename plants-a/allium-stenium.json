    "intro": "Allium stenium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic or lesser garlic, is a perennial herb belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous roots are similar to garlic but are less commonly used in culinary applications. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses."
