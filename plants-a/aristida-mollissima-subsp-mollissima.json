    "intro": "Aristida mollissima subsp. mollissima, commonly known as silky grass or silky threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is often used in restoration projects and native plant gardens."
