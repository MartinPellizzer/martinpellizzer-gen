    "intro": "Astragalus brachycentros, commonly known as the short-centroid milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Astragalus brachycentros plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
