    "intro": "Anteriorchis coriophora var. carpetana, commonly known as the carpet lichen, is a foliose lichen that forms dense, cushion-like growths on rock surfaces. It has a dark green to blackish upper surface with a powdery coating, while the lower surface is pale and covered with tiny, bright yellowish pores. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a green alga and a fungus, which allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in temperate regions on calcareous substrates. This lichen is used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
