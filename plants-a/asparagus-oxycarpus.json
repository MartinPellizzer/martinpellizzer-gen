    "intro": "Asparagus oxycarpus, commonly known as the Cape asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, with small, needle-like leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and succulent-like leaves. The plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
