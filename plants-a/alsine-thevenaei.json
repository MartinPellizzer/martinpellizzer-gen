    "intro": "Alsine thevenaei, commonly known as the desert sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy soils with minimal water. Alsine thevenaei plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
