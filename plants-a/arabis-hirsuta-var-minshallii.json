    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. minshallii, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to cold, dry environments, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
