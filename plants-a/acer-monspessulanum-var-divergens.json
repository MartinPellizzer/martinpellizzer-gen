It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy and adaptable species. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.",
