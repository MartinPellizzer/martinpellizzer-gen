    "intro": "Andropogon tridentatus, commonly known as three-angled grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender flowering stalks that bear small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a distinctive three-angled stem, which contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. Andropogon tridentatus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
