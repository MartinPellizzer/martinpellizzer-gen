    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rotundifolium is primarily native to Kenya and Somalia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions in East Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rotundifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought in during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas such as streambanks and forest edges. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet conditions have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness. However, it is currently considered a minor weed with limited impact on native ecosystems."
