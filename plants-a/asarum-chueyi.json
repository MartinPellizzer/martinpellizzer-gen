    "intro": "Asarum chueyi, commonly known as Chinese wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, reddish-brown flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. However, due to its toxic compounds, it requires careful handling and is not widely cultivated for commercial use."
