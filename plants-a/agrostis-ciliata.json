    "intro": "Agrostis ciliata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and silver-white margins on the leaf edges, which give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
