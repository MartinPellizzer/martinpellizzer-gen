    "intro": "Ambrosia polystachya, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters. The plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause significant respiratory issues in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas. Ambrosia polystachya is an important component of many ecosystems, though its presence can be a nuisance due to its allergenic properties."
