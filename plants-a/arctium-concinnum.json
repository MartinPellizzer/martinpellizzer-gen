It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small umbels. The plant features tall, slender stems covered in coarse, hairy foliage, and it produces spiky, bur-like fruits that cling to animals and clothing. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it blooms with purple to pink flowers in late summer. Arctium concinnum is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
