    "intro": "Adiantum obliquum var. macrodon, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a striking fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
