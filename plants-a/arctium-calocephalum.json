    "intro": "Arctium calocephalum, commonly known as the common burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers that develop into spiky, bur-like fruits, which are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium calocephalum thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
