    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia grandisiliqua is primarily native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This species is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. However, its distribution is limited and it is not widely found outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia grandisiliqua was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in degraded lands. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original range in South America."
