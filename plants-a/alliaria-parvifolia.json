    "intro": "Alliaria parvifolia, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are toothed and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a distinctive three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alliaria parvifolia is invasive in many regions, outcompeting native plants and disrupting local ecosystems."
