    "intro": "Arachnothryx manantlanensis, commonly known as the Manantlan arachnothryx, is a shrub native to the humid forests of southern Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of many leguminous species. It is often found in understory habitats, thriving in the shade of larger trees. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
