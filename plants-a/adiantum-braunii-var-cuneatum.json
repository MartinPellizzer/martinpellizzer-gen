It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
