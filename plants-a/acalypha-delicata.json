This plant thrives in humid and warm environments with abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in lowland areas and near water sources. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions within Peru due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha delicata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its native range, particularly in areas with warm climates. It is often found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
