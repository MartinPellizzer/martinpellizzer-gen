    "intro": "Alsophila alleniae, commonly known as the Allen's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately divided fronds. The plant has a distinctive crown of bright green, feather-like leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its roots form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil and supports the growth of other plants in its habitat. Alsophila alleniae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
