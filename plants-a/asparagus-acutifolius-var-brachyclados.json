    "intro": "Asparagus acutifolius var. brachyclados, commonly known as the short-stemmed asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, woody stems that are typically shorter and more compact compared to other asparagus varieties. The plant produces small, scale-like leaves that are dark green and covered in fine hairs. It blooms with tiny, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
