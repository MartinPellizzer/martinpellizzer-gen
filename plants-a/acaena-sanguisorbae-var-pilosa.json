    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy burr weed, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly, spherical fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. The species is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. pilosa is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. This variant of the species is found in the temperate regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The plant is adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. pilosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion and reduce water runoff. However, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact in non-native habitats."
