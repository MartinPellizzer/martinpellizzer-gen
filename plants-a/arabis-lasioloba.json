    "intro": "Arabis lasioloba, commonly known as the rough-leaved rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many familiar garden plants such as cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, blooming in early spring."
