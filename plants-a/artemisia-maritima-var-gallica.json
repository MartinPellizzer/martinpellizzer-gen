    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. gallica, commonly known as sweet everlasting, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features silver-gray foliage with aromatic, finely divided leaves that release a strong, camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent highlights its ecological and cultural significance."
