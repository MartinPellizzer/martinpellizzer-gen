    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reniformis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is also found in parts of India, particularly in the southern and eastern regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within forests. It is commonly found in the lowland and hill forest regions, where it contributes to the understory vegetation. Its native distribution includes areas with high humidity and well-drained soils, making it a characteristic species of these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reniformis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, heart-shaped leaves. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some natural habitats. However, it is considered invasive in certain areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
