    "intro": "Allium miserabile, commonly known as the autumn crocus, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features striking violet to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round berries that are edible but should be consumed with caution. Its botanical name reflects its melancholic appearance, though it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Allium miserabile thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
