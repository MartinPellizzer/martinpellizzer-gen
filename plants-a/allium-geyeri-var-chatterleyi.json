    "intro": "Allium geyeri var. chatterleyi, commonly known as the Chatterley's garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but are often used more for ornamental purposes due to their aesthetic appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings."
