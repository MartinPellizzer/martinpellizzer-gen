    "intro": "Androsace brigantiaca, commonly known as the Alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically thrives in rocky, alpine environments, where it forms dense mats close to the ground. The plant features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and well-adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Androsace brigantiaca plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
