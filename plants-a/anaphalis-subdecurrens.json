It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique appearance and frost-like appearance during flowering have made it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Anaphalis subdecurrens is also valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
