    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. grandiflora, commonly known as the grandiflora variant of the sweetfern, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features dense, dark green, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a valuable ground cover in shaded, moist environments. It is also notable for its aromatic foliage, which emits a distinctive, spicy scent when crushed."
