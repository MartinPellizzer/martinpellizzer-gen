    "intro": "Acaena dimorphoglochin, commonly known as the variable burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and spiny, glochidiate bracts. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. Its fruits are dry, schizocarpic achenes surrounded by persistent, barbed bracts that aid in seed dispersal. Acaena dimorphoglochin is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena dimorphoglochin is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in various regions across the country, including the South Island and parts of the North Island. This plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine areas, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with open vegetation types such as scrublands and grasslands. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches within New Zealand's diverse landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena dimorphoglochin was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid spread has led to increased management efforts to control its impact on local ecosystems."
