    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa var. emarginata, commonly known as the emarginate false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with 7 to 13 pairs of oval, slightly serrated leaflets. The plant produces racemes of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
