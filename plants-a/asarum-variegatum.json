    "intro": "Asarum variegatum, commonly known as the variegated wild ginger, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, variegated leaves with white and green markings, and it produces small, reddish-brown flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. Asarum variegatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
