    "intro": "Argostemma nubicola, commonly known as the cloud forest argostemma, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a red or purple calyx. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests where humidity is high. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
