    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala var. glabra, commonly known as the white-flowered thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has wiry, silver-green foliage that is covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray make it a valuable plant for stabilizing dune environments."
