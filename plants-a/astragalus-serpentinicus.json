    "intro": "Astragalus serpentinicus, commonly known as the serpent's tongue milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often on serpentine soils, which are rich in heavy metals. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus serpentinicus is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
