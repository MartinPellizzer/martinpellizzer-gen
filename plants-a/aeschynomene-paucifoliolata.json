    "intro": "Aeschynomene paucifoliolata, commonly known as the few-leaved aeschynomene, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and delicate, pea-like flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. Its seeds are typically encased in a hairy pod and are used in traditional medicine in some parts of its native range."
