It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings.",
