    "intro": "Ananas microcephalus, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It produces a fruit that is smaller and less spiky than the typical pineapple, with a sweet, aromatic flavor. The plant has a rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are small and green, typically hidden within the leaf axils. The fruit develops from the flowering stem and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications."
