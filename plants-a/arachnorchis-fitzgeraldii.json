    "intro": "Arachnorchis fitzgeraldii, commonly known as the Fitzgerald's spider-orchid, is an orchid species native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble legs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in woodland areas, thriving in the subtropical and temperate regions of Queensland and New South Wales. It produces small, pale green or yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species, prompting conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
