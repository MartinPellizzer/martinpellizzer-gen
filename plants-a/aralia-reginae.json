    "intro": "Aralia reginae, commonly known as the Queen Aralia, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can reach up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aralia reginae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and unique appearance."
