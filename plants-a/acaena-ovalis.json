    "intro": "Acaena ovalis, commonly known as the oval thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, bract-like leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant produces achene fruits that are surrounded by a persistent, woolly pappus, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. Acaena ovalis is valued for its ecological role in supporting native insect populations and its historical use by M\u0101ori for medicinal purposes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the subantarctic and temperate regions of New Zealand. Acaena ovalis is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native insect and bird populations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread readily."
