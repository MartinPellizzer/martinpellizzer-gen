    "intro": "Atriplex pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or saline soils. Atriplex pueblensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various desert wildlife."
