    "intro": "Alnus hirtella, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and hazels, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Alnus hirtella is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, enhancing soil fertility in its growing environment."
