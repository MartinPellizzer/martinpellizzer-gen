    "intro": "Acacia truculenta, commonly known as the prickly acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its spiny branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like seed pods that contain edible seeds, which are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia truculenta is well adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitats.",

This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia truculenta plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and soil stabilization.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia truculenta was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to prevent soil erosion. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts in non-native environments. Due to its resilience, it has been planted for ornamental and landscaping purposes in various regions."
