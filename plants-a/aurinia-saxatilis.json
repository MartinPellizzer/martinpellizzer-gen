    "intro": "Aurinia saxatilis, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, sometimes glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Aurinia saxatilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
