    "intro": "Apalus, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Apalus thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its popularity as a houseplant is due to its ability to bloom continuously throughout the year under proper care."
