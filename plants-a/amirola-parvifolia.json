    "intro": "Amirola parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved amirola, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil of its habitat. Amirola parvifolia is often found growing in shaded, moist undergrowth where it thrives in humid conditions."
