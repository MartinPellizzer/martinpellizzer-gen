    "intro": "Aristolochia cuyabensis, commonly known as the Cuyabeno arrow vine, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, winding vines and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces unique, tubular flowers that are often maroon or purple in color, with a complex structure that attracts specific pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like and contain small, dark seeds. Due to its habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species within its native range."
