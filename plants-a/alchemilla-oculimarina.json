    "intro": "Alchemilla oculimarina, commonly known as sea almonds, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats along the shore. The plant features small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are succulent and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Alchemilla oculimarina is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
