It features small, gray-green, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are borne in clusters atop the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its aromatic properties and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
