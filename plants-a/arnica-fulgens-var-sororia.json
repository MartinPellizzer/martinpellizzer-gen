    "intro": "Arnica fulgens var. sororia, commonly known as the alpine tawnpuff, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and often branched. The flowers are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind pollination and seed dispersal."
