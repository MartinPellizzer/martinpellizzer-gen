    "intro": "Adenocalymma croceum, commonly known as the yellow globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant's root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils.",
