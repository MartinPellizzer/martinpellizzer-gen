    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena krausei var. meionandra is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as scrublands and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas where the soil is well-drained. The species is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena krausei var. meionandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with ornamental and ecological value. This variant is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in native habitats, sometimes competing with indigenous plant species. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common component of the local flora in certain areas."
