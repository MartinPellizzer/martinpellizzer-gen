    "intro": "Alnus incana var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves, which are typically alternate and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in catkins, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that release seeds when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
