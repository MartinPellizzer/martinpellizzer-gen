    "intro": "Angraecum eburneum subsp. superbum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
