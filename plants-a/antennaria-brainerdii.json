    "intro": "Antennaria brainerdii, commonly known as Brainerd's mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are usually pale pink to white in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
