    "intro": "Arthrophytum betpakdalense, commonly known as the Betpakdal cactus, is a rare and endemic species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a compact, rounded shape that helps it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in extreme desert conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
