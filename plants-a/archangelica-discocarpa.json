    "intro": "Archangelica discocarpa, commonly known as the clustered hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which give it its specific epithet *discocarpa* meaning \"disk-like fruit.\" The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a strong, aromatic scent, while the roots are thick and fleshy. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a potentially invasive species in some regions."
