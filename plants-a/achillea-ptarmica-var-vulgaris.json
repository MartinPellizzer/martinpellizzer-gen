It features a compact, bushy growth habit with finely divided, fern-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pink or red. The plant is characterized by its aromatic, slightly hairy foliage and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Common yarrow is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine.",
