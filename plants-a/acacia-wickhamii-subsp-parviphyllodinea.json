    "intro": "Acacia wickhamii subsp. parviphyllodinea, commonly known as the small-leaf wickham acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, globular clusters, which are often visited by nectar-feeding insects and birds. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand prolonged drought. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations.",

It is found in the Pilbara and Gascoyne regions, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. This subspecies is commonly associated with sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia wickhamii subsp. parviphyllodinea was mainly introduced to South Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Lower Southeast and the Upper South East. This subspecies is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a characteristic feature of the local flora in these areas."
