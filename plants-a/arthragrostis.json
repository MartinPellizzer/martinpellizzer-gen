    "intro": "Arthragrostis, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a genus of grasses that includes several species native to temperate regions. These plants typically have fine, tufted leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Arthragrostis species are often found in moist, well-drained soils and are commonly used in turfgrass cultivation. They exhibit rhizomatous growth, allowing them to spread and form dense mats. The genus is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for lawns and golf courses."
