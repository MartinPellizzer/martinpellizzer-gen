    "intro": "Achroanthes monophyllos, commonly known as the single-leaf achroanthes, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its single, broad, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that bloom in late spring, making it a unique addition to botanical gardens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in swampy areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
