    "intro": "Aristolochia klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the lowland rainforests of Indonesia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to brown coloration. The plant has heart-shaped, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their strong, musty odor. The plant contains various bioactive compounds and has been used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic and should be handled with care."
