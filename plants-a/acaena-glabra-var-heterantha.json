    "intro": "Acaena glabra var. heterantha, commonly known as the hairy spinney, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. The plant produces tiny, spiny fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often consumed by birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. This species thrives in coastal and subalpine habitats, where it plays an important ecological role.",
