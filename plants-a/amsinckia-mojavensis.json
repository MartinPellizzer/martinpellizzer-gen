It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Amsinckia mojavensis is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
