    "intro": "Aster strictus, commonly known as stiff aster, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces blue to purple flowers with yellow centers. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Aster strictus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
