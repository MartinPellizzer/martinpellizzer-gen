    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. This plant thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes, typically found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly associated with mixed coniferous and broadleaf forests, where it receives partial shade and well-drained soil. The species is known for its striking yellow foliage, which makes it a desirable ornamental plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum f. lutescens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its unique yellow foliage. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant's introduction has been limited to specific areas where it can thrive in well-drained soils and partial shade. It is not widely naturalized outside of its cultivated settings. Its distribution remains primarily confined to horticultural collections and specialized landscapes."
