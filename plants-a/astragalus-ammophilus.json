    "intro": "Astragalus ammophilus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus ammophilus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
