It is characterized by its unique, tubular, heart-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are typically eaten by birds, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and can be found in shaded, moist environments."
