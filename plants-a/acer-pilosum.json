    "intro": "Acer pilosum, commonly known as the downy maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age.",
