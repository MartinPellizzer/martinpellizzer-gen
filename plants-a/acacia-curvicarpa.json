    "intro": "Acacia curvicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid regions, demonstrating adaptability to poor soils and drought conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in revegetation projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia curvicarpa is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy or rocky soils. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open woodlands or shrublands. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can withstand periods of drought. Acacia curvicarpa is also known for its distinctive, narrow leaves and yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia curvicarpa was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region, as part of ecological restoration projects and for its ornamental value. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant has been used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from outcompeting native flora."
