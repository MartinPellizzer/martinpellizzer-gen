    "intro": "Arenaria festucoides, commonly known as sandgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal and dry environments. Its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
