    "intro": "Alnus tenuifolia var. virescens, commonly known as the slender alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often near streams or in wetlands. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they turn yellow in the fall. Its small, catkin-like flowers appear in early spring, and it produces edible seeds that are consumed by various wildlife species. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat in riparian ecosystems."
