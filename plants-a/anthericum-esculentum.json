    "intro": "Anthericum esculentum, commonly known as the edible arum, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces edible rhizomes that are often used in traditional cuisines, though they contain calcium oxalate crystals which can cause irritation if not properly prepared. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and can grow up to 30 cm in diameter, while the flowers are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
