    "intro": "Aristida transvaalensis, commonly known as Transvaal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for ornamental and ecological landscaping. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
