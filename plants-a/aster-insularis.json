    "intro": "Aster insularis, commonly known as the island aster, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas of native forests, preferring rich, well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Aster insularis is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and invasive species competition."
