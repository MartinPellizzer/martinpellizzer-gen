    "intro": "Armoracia lacustris, commonly known as the lake horseradish, is a perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other members like mustard and cabbage. The plant features a thick, aromatic root that is often used in culinary applications, similar to its more well-known relative, Armoracia rusticana. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, yellow, and arranged in clusters. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found near lakes, marshes, and along riverbanks."
