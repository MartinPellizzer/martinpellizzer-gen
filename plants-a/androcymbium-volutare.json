    "intro": "Androcymbium volutare, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and exotic flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
