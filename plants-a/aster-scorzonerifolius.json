    "intro": "Aster scorzonerifolius, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its showy purple or pinkish-blue flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
