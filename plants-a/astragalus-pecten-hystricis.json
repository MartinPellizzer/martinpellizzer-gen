    "intro": "Astragalus pecten-hystricis, commonly known as the goat's rue, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are often mistaken for a type of fern due to their feathery appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. Astragalus pecten-hystricis is known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
