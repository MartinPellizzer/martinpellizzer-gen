    "intro": "Ascidieria verticillaris, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its roots are shallow but extensive, allowing it to absorb moisture from a wide area. Ascidieria verticillaris is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
