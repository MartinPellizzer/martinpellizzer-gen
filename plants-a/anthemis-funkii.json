It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
