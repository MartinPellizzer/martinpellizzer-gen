    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. rothii, commonly known as the Roth's bentgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and creeping growth habit, which allows it to form dense, uniform turf. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, along streambanks, and in coastal areas. Due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes used in specialty turfgrass applications."
