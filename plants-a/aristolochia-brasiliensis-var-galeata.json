    "intro": "Aristolochia brasiliensis var. galeata, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, saddle-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, spicy odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution."
