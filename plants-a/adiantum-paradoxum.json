    "intro": "Adiantum paradoxum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bi-lobed and often droop gracefully. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum paradoxum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
