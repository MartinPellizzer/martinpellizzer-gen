    "intro": "Aspidium papyraceum, commonly known as the paper fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often described as papery in texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium papyraceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
