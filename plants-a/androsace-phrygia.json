The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, alpine environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in open, sunny habitats. Androsace phrygia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
