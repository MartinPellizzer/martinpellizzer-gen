    "intro": "Anathallis nortonii, commonly known as the Norton's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like floral structure, which features a slender, curling column and a single, elongated lip. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic habit, and thrives in high humidity and cool, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, with intricate patterns that mimic the appearance of a spider. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis nortonii is considered a critically endangered species."
