    "intro": "Agrostis aquatica, commonly known as watergrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, lakes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis aquatica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
