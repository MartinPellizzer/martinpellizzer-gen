    "intro": "Astragalus whitedii, commonly known as White's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several small leaflets. Astragalus whitedii is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. It is often found in arid regions and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
