    "intro": "Astragalus incanus subsp. nummularioides, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, and its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and plains, where it thrives in full sun. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
