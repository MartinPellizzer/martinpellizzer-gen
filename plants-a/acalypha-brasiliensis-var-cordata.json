    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. cordata is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It is commonly found in the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. It is also present in parts of Peru and Colombia. Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. cordata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant's ability to thrive in both full sun and partial shade makes it a popular choice for landscapers and gardeners. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation. Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
