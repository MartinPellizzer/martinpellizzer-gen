    "intro": "Asperula oppositifolia subsp. oppositifolia, commonly known as the oppositeleaf woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and dense foliage make it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland landscapes."
