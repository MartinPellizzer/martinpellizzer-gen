    "intro": "Arenaria ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Arenaria ferruginea is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
