    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta aristeguietae is primarily native to Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in high-altitude areas with rocky soils. The species is part of the family Euphorbiaceae. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta aristeguietae was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of South America. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure. The plant is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing on slopes or cliffs. Due to its hardy nature, it has been successfully established in several regions outside its native range. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
