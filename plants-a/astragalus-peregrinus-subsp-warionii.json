    "intro": "Astragalus peregrinus subsp. warionii, commonly known as the warionii milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods that contain several oval, smooth seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
