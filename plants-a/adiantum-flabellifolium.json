    "intro": "Adiantum flabellifolium, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and often display a silvery underside. Native to the eastern United States, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
