    "intro": "Avena cernua, commonly known as the nodding oat, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, drooping inflorescences that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating self-pollination. Avena cernua typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
