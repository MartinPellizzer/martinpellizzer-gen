    "intro": "Arnica montana subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent yellow centers. The plant is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
