    "intro": "Acantholimon calvertii, commonly known as Calvert's thornscale, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, succulent stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low, spreading growth habit and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species.",

This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in rocky and dry habitats. It is commonly associated with steppe and semi-arid environments. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Transcaucasus and Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon calvertii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen growing along the edges of dunes and in disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in these regions."
