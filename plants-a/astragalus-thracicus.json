    "intro": "Astragalus thracicus, commonly known as the Thrace milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces pods that contain small, edible seeds, which are an important food source for certain wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
