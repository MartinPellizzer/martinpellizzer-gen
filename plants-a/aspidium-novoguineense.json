    "intro": "Aspidium novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium novoguineense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
