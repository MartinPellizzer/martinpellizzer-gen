    "intro": "Aspidium eminens, commonly known as the tall water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water Ferns. It is characterized by its large, dark green, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often submerged or partially submerged, anchoring it in muddy substrates. The fronds are covered in small, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss and provide a habitat for microorganisms."
