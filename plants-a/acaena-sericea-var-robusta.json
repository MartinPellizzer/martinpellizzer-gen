    "intro": "Acaena sericea var. robusta, commonly known as the silky burr or coastal burr, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces bright red, spherical fruits that are often used as bird food. The plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sericea var. robusta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the mainland, including the North and South Islands. This variety is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the northern regions. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained sites. The plant is often seen in native forests, shrublands, and along coastal margins.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sericea var. robusta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites and is now considered a weed in some areas."
