    "intro": "Alliaria fraseriana, commonly known as winter cress, is a flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by rounded, seed-containing pods. Its leaves are alternate, oval, and have a peppery scent when crushed, similar to other members of the mustard family. Winter cress is known for its ability to thrive in cool climates and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
