It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
