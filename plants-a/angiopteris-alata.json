    "intro": "Angiopteris alata, commonly known as the fan fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that radiate from a central trunk, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant has a strobilus, or cone-like structure, at the base of its fronds, which produces spores for reproduction. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Angiopteris alata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to adapt to various indoor conditions."
