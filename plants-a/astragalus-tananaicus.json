    "intro": "Astragalus tananaicus, commonly known as Tanana milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually compound with multiple leaflets. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme climates. Astragalus tananaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various arctic and alpine organisms."
