    "intro": "Agropyron gmelinii subsp. tenuisetum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its low-growing, compact growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. It has deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
