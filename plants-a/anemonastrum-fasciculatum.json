    "intro": "Anemonastrum fasciculatum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often covering rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Anemonastrum fasciculatum is well-suited for xeriscaping and is often used in dryland restoration projects."
