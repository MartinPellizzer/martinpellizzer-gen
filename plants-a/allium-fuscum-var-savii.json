    "intro": "Allium fuscum var. savii, commonly known as the Tuscan garlic or wild garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in the summer, followed by bulb-like structures that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Due to its mild garlic flavor, it is sometimes used as a substitute for regular garlic in cooking."
