    "intro": "Allium barsczewskii f. niveum, commonly known as the snow-white leek, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of pale to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, with a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited natural range and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
