    "intro": "Aristolochia obliqua, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, saddle-shaped flowers that are often dark purple or brown. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
