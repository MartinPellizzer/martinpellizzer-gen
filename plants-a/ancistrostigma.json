    "intro": "Ancistrostigma, commonly known as the \"scentless orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often lack a strong fragrance. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on trees or rocks in humid environments. Ancistrostigma species have lance-shaped leaves and produce intricate, often showy inflorescences. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, they are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
