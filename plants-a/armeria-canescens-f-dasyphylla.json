    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. dasyphylla, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It is a succulent plant with dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid, saline environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its fleshy leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to rocky and coastal soils. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
