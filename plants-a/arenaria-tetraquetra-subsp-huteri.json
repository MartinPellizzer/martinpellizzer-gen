    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. huteri, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender stems. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, providing protection against desiccation and frost. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and mountainous areas."
