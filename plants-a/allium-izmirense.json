    "intro": "Allium izmirense, commonly known as the Izmirensk garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
