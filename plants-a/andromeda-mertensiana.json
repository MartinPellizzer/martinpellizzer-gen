    "intro": "Andromeda mertensiana, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in suitable climates."
