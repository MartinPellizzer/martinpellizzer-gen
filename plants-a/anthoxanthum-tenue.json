    "intro": "Anthoxanthum tenue, commonly known as slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with yellowish to brownish florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum tenue is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife and soil stability."
