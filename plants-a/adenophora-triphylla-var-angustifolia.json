    "intro": "Adenophora triphylla var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features slender, often hairy stems that grow from a taproot and bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers in late summer, which are followed by cylindrical seed pods. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs that secrete a milky sap, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands.",
