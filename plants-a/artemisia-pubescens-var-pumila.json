    "intro": "Artemisia pubescens var. pumila, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense, fine pubescence covering its leaves. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in panicles and bloom in late summer. The aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its medicinal and ecological significance."
