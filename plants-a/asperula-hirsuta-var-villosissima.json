    "intro": "Asperula hirsuta var. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, compact foliage with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and delicate floral display."
