It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Amomum nutans thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
