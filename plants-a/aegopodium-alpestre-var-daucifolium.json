    "intro": "Aegopodium alpestre var. daucifolium, commonly known as alpine ground elder, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a robust root system and erect, branched stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges and a distinctive light green color, often mistaken for other members of the Apiaceae family. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
