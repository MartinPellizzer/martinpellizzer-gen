    "intro": "Avena planiculmis var. taurinensis, commonly known as the Taurine oat, is a rare and endemic grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Italy. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
