    "intro": "Alectorolophus phallax var. hispanicus, commonly known as the Spanish mountain orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils at high altitudes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle beauty to the mountainous landscapes. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
