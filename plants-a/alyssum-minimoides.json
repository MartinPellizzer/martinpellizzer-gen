    "intro": "Alyssum minimoides, commonly known as dwarf alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum minimoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
