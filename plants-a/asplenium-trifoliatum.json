    "intro": "Asplenium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and trifoliate (three-lobed) fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in clusters called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in crevices. Asplenium trifoliatum is a hardy species that is widely distributed across temperate regions of the world."
