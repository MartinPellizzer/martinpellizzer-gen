    "intro": "Androsace occidentalis, commonly known as Western rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
