    "intro": "Arthraxon lanceolatus f. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy speargrass, is a variant of the speargrass species native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its distinguishing \"hairy\" appearance. It typically grows in open grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
