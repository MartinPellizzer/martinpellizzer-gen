    "intro": "Amitostigma thailandicum, commonly known as the Thai bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Thailand. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests and stream sides. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
