    "intro": "Ardisia pyrgus, commonly known as the dwarf flame bush, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Ardisia pyrgus is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, attractive groundcover."
