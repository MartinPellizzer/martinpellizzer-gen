    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum subsp. spathaceum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, gray-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tall, leafy stems that bear small, spherical, violet-blue flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
