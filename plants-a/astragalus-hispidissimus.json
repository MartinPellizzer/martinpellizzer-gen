    "intro": "Astragalus hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus hispidissimus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
