    "intro": "Alsine laricifolia var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features small, succulent leaves that are densely covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy substrates. This variant is distinguished by its particularly dense pubescence compared to other forms of Alsine laricifolia."
