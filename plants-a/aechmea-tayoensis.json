    "intro": "Aechmea tayoensis, commonly known as the Taiti bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of Central America, particularly in Costa Rica and Panama. This plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 30 cm in length. Aechmea tayoensis produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which attract pollinators like hummingbirds and bees."
