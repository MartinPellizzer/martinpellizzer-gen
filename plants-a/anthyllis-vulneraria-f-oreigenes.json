It features a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and is adapted to rocky and arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
