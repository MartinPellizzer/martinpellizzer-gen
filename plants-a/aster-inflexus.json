    "intro": "Aster inflexus, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to North America. It features a sprawling growth habit with slender, hairy stems that often lie flat on the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple, pink, or white, which bloom in the late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster inflexus is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
