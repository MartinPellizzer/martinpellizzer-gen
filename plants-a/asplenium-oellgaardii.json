    "intro": "Asplenium oellgaardii, commonly known as the Oellgaard\u2019s spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium oellgaardii is notable for its ability to adapt to various microhabitats, making it a common sight in humid, forested areas."
