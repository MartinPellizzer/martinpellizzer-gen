    "intro": "Astragalus xanthoxiphidium, commonly known as yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions to native plant communities."
