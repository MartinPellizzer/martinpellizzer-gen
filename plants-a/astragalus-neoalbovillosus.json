    "intro": "Astragalus neoalbovillosus, commonly known as the white-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has a hairy, glandular surface that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert steppe habitats. Astragalus neoalbovillosus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest for ecological and medicinal research."
