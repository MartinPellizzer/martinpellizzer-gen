    "intro": "Atriplex cristata var. pulvinata, commonly known as the cushion saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing soils in desert ecosystems. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in xeriscaping."
