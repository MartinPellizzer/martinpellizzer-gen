    "intro": "Alkibias hastata, commonly known as the narrowleaf alkaliweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Alkibias hastata is adapted to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in desert and grassland habitats. Its growth habit and morphological features reflect its ability to survive in harsh, dry environments."
