    "intro": "Actinostemon lundianus, commonly known as the Lake Victoria water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the Great Lakes region of East Africa. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that form a dense canopy on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots anchor it to the lake bottom, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form colonies. Actinostemon lundianus plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for aquatic life and contributing to water filtration.",
