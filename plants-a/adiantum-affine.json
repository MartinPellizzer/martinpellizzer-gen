    "intro": "Adiantum affine, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often described as resembling the wings of a bird. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to rocky or sandy substrates. Adiantum affine is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
