    "intro": "Austrostipa aquarii, commonly known as the Aquarius wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Austrostipa aquarii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its native range."
