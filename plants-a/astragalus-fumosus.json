    "intro": "Astragalus fumosus, commonly known as the smoky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus fumosus plays a role in soil stabilization and is a food source for various herbivores."
