    "intro": "Aconitum monanthum, commonly known as the single-flower monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed divisions, and its roots are tuberous, contributing to its hardy nature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or woodland habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
