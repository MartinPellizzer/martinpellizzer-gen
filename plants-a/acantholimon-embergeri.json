    "intro": "Acantholimon embergeri, commonly known as the Emberger's thornscale, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils at high elevations. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

This plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Iran where the environmental conditions are suitable for its survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon embergeri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in the United States. It is valued for its ornamental appeal, with its blue to purple flowers and drought-tolerant nature. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments."
