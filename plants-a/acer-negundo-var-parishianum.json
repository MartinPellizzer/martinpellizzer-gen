    "intro": "Acer negundo var. parishianum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lobed leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and has a broad, spreading crown. The bark is smooth and gray, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced as the tree ages.",
