    "intro": "Alopecurus agrestis, commonly known as mousegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, tufted stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often mistaken for other similar grasses due to its delicate appearance. Alopecurus agrestis is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
