    "intro": "Artemisia nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. Artemisia nepalensis is often found in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. It has been traditionally used in local medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
