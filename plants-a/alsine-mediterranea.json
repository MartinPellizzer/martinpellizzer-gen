    "intro": "Alsine mediterranea, commonly known as Mediterranean sandwort, is a small annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal areas or along roadsides. The plant has tiny, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alsine mediterranea is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
