    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. pratinum, commonly known as the Norway maple, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically bright green in summer and turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. This species is often planted for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities in urban landscapes.",
