    "intro": "Angraecum tenue, commonly known as the slender star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, pendant inflorescences bearing small, star-shaped flowers with white petals and a distinctive violet or purple lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich substrates. It blooms during the dry season, typically between July and September, and is adapted to the unique microclimates of its native habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Angraecum tenue is considered a conservation concern."
