    "intro": "Allmania nodiflora var. depauperata, commonly known as the spiny false nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its reduced floral structures and overall more sparse appearance compared to the typical form of Allmania nodiflora."
