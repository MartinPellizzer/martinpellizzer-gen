It typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is well adapted to cold climates. The plant has aromatic, gray-green leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. It produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. Artemisia alaskana is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
