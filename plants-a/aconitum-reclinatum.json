    "intro": "Aconitum reclinatum, commonly known as the nodding aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that bear clusters of blue to purple flowers, which droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aconitum reclinatum contains potent toxins, making it both beautiful and dangerous to handle.",
