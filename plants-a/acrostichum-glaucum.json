It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a layer of dead, fibrous leaves. Its reproductive structures include spore-producing cones located at the base of the fronds. Acrostichum glaucum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
