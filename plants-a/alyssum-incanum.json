    "intro": "Alyssum incanum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with gray-green foliage covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Alyssum incanum is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
