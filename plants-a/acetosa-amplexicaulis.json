    "intro": "Acetosa amplexicaulis, commonly known as the clasping sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often heart-shaped and clasping around the stems, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, which can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. Acetosa amplexicaulis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks.",
