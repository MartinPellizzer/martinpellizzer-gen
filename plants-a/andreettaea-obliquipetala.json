    "intro": "Andreettaea obliquipetala, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a species of fern native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant has a compact growth habit, with short, creeping rhizomes that help it anchor in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a unique asymmetrical shape that sets it apart from other fern species. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in rocky or shaded forest understories."
