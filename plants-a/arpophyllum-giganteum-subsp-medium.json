It typically grows in wetland and swampy environments, where it thrives in waterlogged soils. The plant features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowering stems produce clusters of small, white to pale green flowers, which bloom in spring. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for native fauna."
