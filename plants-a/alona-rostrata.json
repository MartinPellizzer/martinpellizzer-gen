    "intro": "Alona rostrata, commonly known as the rostrated water flea, is a small aquatic crustacean belonging to the family Daphniidae. It is characterized by its elongated body and a distinct rostrum, which is a prominent forward-pointing structure. This species is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Alona rostrata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by filtering plankton and contributing to nutrient cycling. Its presence is often used as an indicator of water quality due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
