    "intro": "Alloneuron ulei, commonly known as the African sand dollar, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, spherical stem covered in dense, woolly hair that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by distinctive, spiky fruits. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Alloneuron ulei is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
