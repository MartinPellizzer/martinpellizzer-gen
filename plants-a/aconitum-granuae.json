    "intro": "Aconitum granuae, commonly known as the Granua larkspur, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes along the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed divisions, and are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Aconitum granuae is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.",
