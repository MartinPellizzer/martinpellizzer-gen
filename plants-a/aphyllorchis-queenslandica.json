    "intro": "Aphyllorchis queenslandica, commonly known as the Queensland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique, slender pseudobulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rainforests or under dense canopy cover. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
