    "intro": "Acer hyrcanum subsp. keckianum, commonly known as the Keck's maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in its native habitat.",
