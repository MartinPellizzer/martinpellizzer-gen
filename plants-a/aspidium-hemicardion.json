    "intro": "Aspidium hemicardion, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium hemicardion is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or semi-aquatic gardens."
