    "intro": "Aesculus glabra var. sargentii, commonly known as the Sargent's horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and have 5 to 7 leaflets. The tree produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in upright panicles during the spring, followed by spiny, woody capsules containing bright red, shiny seeds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value."
