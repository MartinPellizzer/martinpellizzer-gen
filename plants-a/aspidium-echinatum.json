    "intro": "Aspidium echinatum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its sturdy, upright fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
