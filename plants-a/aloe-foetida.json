    "intro": "Aloe foetida, commonly known as the stink aloe, is a perennial succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its strong, unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its flowers. Aloe foetida is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes despite its pungent scent."
