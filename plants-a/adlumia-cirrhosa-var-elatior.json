It features compound leaves with elongated, arching leaflets that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels, followed by dark purple berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and unique flowering habit, which adds visual interest throughout the growing season.",
