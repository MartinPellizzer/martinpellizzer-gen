    "intro": "Agrostis chinensis, commonly known as Chinese meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, erect stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Agrostis chinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
