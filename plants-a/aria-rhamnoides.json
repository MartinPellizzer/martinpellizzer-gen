    "intro": "Aria rhamnoides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats. Aria rhamnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
