It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a rusty-colored pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, woody fruits. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
