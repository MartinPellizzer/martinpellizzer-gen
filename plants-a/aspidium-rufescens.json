    "intro": "Aspidium rufescens, commonly known as the rusty shield fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often covered in a rusty-colored bloom. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures called sori. Aspidium rufescens is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
