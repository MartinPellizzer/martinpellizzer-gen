It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla submamillata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
