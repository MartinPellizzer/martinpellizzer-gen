    "intro": "Anthurium oyuelae, commonly known as the Oyuela anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathe that comes in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with a contrasting green spadix. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically large, glossy, and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium oyuelae is prized in horticulture for its unique floral display and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
