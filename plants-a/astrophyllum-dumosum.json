    "intro": "Astrophyllum dumosum, commonly known as the dense-leaf cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that often form a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems. Astrophyllum dumosum is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
