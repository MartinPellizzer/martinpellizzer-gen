It features slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are borne on short pedicels. Its flowering period usually occurs during the wet season, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aneilema minutiflorum is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
