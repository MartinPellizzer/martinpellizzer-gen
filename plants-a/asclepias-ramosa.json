    "intro": "Asclepias ramosa, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of pink to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often branched and ribbed. Asclepias ramosa is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting local pollinator populations. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but not to monarchs."
