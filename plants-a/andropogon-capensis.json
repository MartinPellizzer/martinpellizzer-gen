    "intro": "Andropogon capensis, commonly known as the Natal grass or red grass, is a tall perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a reddish tinge, especially when young, and grows in dense clumps. The plant produces panicles of small, pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in savannas and grasslands. Andropogon capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
