    "intro": "Anthemis fuscata, commonly known as the brown ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like structure. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture and produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects."
