    "intro": "Alyssum atlanticum subsp. decoloratum, commonly known as the Atlantic alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its coastal habitat. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a hardy plant for maritime environments. It is often used in coastal landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
