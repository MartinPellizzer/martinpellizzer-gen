    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. mutica, commonly known as silky bentgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for ground cover. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are covered with short, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks."
