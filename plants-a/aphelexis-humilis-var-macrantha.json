It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range."
