    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha trilaciniata is primarily native to Mexico Southwest. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in desert scrub habitats. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of the region. This species is an important part of the local flora and ecosystem in southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha trilaciniata was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Southeast Asia and was likely brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. The plant thrives in tropical climates and has spread rapidly in native ecosystems. It competes with native plants for resources and can alter habitat structure. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
