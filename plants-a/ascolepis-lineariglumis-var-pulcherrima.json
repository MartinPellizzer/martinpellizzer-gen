It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and striking, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
