It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its concealed or less prominent floral structures compared to other Arenaria species."
