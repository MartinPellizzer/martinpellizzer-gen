    "intro": "Arabidopsis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its small, basal rosette of hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing at high elevations. Due to its genetic simplicity and short life cycle, it is also a model organism in plant biology research."
