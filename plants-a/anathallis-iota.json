    "intro": "Anathallis iota, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air rather than soil. Its small, strap-like leaves are adapted to capture humidity, and it blooms during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
