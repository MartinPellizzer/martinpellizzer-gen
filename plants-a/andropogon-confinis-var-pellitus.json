    "intro": "Andropogon confinis var. pellitus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its slightly broader leaves and more compact growth compared to other Andropogon species."
