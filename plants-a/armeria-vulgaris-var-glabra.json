    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. glabra, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its saline and windy environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. Its salt tolerance and ability to stabilize dunes make it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
