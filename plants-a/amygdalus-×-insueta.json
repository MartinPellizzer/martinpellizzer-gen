    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 insueta, commonly known as the wild almond or bitter almond, is a hybrid species within the Prunus genus. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard seeds encased in a woody pod, which contain a toxic compound called amygdalin. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for its edible nuts."
