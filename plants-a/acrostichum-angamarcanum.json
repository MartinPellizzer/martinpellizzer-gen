    "intro": "Acrostichum angamarcanum, commonly known as the Angamarca fern, is a species of fern native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat. The Angamarca fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
