    "intro": "Artemisia desertorum var. macrocephala, commonly known as the desert sagebrush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant produces compact, spherical clusters of florets, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. Its essential oils contribute to its strong, often pungent scent, which can deter herbivores."
