    "intro": "Atriplex intracontinentalis, commonly known as the inland saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often appearing in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and thrive in saline soils. Atriplex intracontinentalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
