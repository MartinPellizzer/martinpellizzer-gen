    "intro": "Asimina pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf wild cherry, is a small, deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by yellowish-orange fruits that are edible but generally not widely consumed. Asimina pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
