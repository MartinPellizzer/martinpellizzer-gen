    "intro": "Asplenium oblongatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant has a distinctive rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium oblongatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
