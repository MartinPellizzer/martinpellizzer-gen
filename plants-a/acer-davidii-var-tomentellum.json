    "intro": "Acer davidii var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan in China. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fluffy appearance, especially when young. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and autumn color.",
