    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features a dense rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
