    "intro": "Alyssum sartorii, commonly known as common alyssum, is an annual flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, rounded seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Alyssum sartorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
