    "intro": "Alchemilla glabra var. dasyneura, commonly known as hairy lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of silvery-hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and densely covered with fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
