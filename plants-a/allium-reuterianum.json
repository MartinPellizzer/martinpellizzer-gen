    "intro": "Allium reuterianum, commonly known as the Turk's cap leek, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, leafy stem topped with a spherical inflorescence of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic-like odor and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in temperate climates. Allium reuterianum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
