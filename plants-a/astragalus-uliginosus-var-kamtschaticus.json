    "intro": "Astragalus uliginosus var. kamtschaticus, commonly known as the Kamtschatic mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East. It typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
