    "intro": "Anisomeles papuana, commonly known as the Papuan sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy, dark green appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing single seeds. It is often found growing in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its aromatic wood. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
