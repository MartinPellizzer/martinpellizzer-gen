    "intro": "Arenaria tweedyi, commonly known as Tweedy's sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Tweedy's sandwort is a member of the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions."
