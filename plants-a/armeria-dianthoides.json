    "intro": "Armeria dianthoides, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has linear, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Armeria dianthoides is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils while adding ornamental value to gardens."
