The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster patens thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and natural habitats."
