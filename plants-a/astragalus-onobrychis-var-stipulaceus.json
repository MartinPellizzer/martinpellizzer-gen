    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. stipulaceus, commonly known as yellow hillbilly, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stipules, and it produces small, yellow to orange flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. It has a deep root system, which helps it thrive in poor soil conditions. This species is also valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various pollinators."
