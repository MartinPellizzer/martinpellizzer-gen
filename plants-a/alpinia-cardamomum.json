    "intro": "Alpinia cardamomum, commonly known as the black cardamom, is a tropical perennial plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its tall, aromatic rhizomes that produce a distinctive, smoky-flavored spice. The plant typically grows in shady, moist environments at high altitudes, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are clustered and often yellow or greenish-white. The dried, dark reddish-brown fruit is the primary part used in cooking and traditional medicine."
