    "intro": "Astragalus razicus, commonly known as the coastal milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion due to its deep root system. Astragalus razicus is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in coastal ecosystems."
