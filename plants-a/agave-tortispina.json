    "intro": "Agave tortispina, commonly known as the spiny leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in sharp spines. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a textured surface. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid environments."
