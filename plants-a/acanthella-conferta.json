    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthella conferta is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, specifically from Queensland to New South Wales. It is commonly found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal ecosystems. It is well adapted to the salty and windy conditions of the coastal environment. Acanthella conferta plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthella conferta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1970s and has since spread throughout the North Island. The plant is considered an environmental weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native species. It thrives in disturbed areas such as roadsides, riverbanks, and forest edges. Control measures include mechanical removal and the use of targeted herbicides."
