    "intro": "Agrostis quadriseta, commonly known as the four-row bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies in disturbed soils. Agrostis quadriseta is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
