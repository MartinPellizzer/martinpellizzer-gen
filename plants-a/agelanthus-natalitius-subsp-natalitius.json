    "intro": "Agelanthus natalitius subsp. natalitius, commonly known as Natal's agelanthus, is a rare and endemic species native to the Eastern Cape of South Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
