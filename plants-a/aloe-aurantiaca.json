    "intro": "Aloe aurantiaca, commonly known as the orange aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a reddish or orange tinge. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Aloe aurantiaca is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
