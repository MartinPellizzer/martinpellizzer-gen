    "intro": "Astragalus altimontanus, commonly known as the high mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a low-growing habit with slender stems and compound leaves, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus altimontanus is adapted to cold, arid conditions and is often found in areas with limited soil nutrients."
