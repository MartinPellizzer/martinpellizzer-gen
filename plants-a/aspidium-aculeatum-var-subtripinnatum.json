    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. subtripinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its finely divided, tripinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its fronds are often submerged or floating, contributing to aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. This variant is notable for its adaptability to aquatic conditions and its role in maintaining water quality through nutrient cycling."
