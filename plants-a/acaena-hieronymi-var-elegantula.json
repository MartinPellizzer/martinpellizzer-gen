    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena hieronymi var. elegantula is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in Chile and Argentina. This plant is commonly found in the temperate and subpolar zones of these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The species is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its distinctive bracts and small, edible berries. Its native distribution is closely tied to the specific climatic and ecological conditions of these South American regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hieronymi var. elegantula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly successful in disturbed habitats. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
