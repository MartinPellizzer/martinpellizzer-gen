    "intro": "Anthodus, commonly known as the \"sea scorpion,\" is an extinct genus of arthropods that lived during the Cambrian period. It belongs to the class Merostomata and is characterized by its segmented body and pair of pincers. Anthodus had a robust exoskeleton composed primarily of chitin, which provided protection against predators. Its body was typically divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen, with multiple pairs of walking legs. Fossils of Anthodus are often found in marine sediments, indicating it was a marine creature that thrived in ancient oceans."
