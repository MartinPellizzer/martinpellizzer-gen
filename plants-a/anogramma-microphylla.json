    "intro": "Anogramma microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Onocleaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in lines along the veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
