    "intro": "Agropyron junceum var. crassum, commonly known as rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and coarse, wiry leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
