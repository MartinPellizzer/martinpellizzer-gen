    "intro": "Astragalus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features slender stems with small, compound leaves and produces yellow or cream-colored flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus parviflorus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
