    "intro": "Andruris andajensis, commonly known as the Andean orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Peru. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology includes long, slender stems and small, clustered blossoms that display a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andruris andajensis is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat destruction."
