    "intro": "Allium rotundum var. reichenbachianum, commonly known as the Persian leek, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, rounded bulb covered in a papery, fibrous skin. The plant produces clusters of slender, grass-like leaves and small, pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its mild, onion-like flavor and is often used in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines. Botanically, it is closely related to other Allium species, including garlic and leeks."
