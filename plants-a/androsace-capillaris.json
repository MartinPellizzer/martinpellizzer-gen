    "intro": "Androsace capillaris, commonly known as the slender rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in meadows, cliffs, and mountainous areas. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
