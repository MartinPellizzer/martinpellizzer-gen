    "intro": "Aspidium alpinum, commonly known as the alpine wood fern, is a perennial fern native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, bushy appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
