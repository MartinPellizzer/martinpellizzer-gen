    "intro": "Andropogon insularis, commonly known as the Bahama grass, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean islands. It typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, exhibiting a clump-forming habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it resilient in coastal environments. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
