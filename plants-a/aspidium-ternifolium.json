    "intro": "Aspidium ternifolium, commonly known as the three-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically divided into three parts, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near streams. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium ternifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
