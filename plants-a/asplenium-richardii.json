    "intro": "Asplenium richardii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which helps anchor it to rocky substrates. Asplenium richardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
