    "intro": "Astragalus inaniae, commonly known as the Desert Milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has palmately compound leaves, typically with five to seven leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Astragalus inaniae is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
