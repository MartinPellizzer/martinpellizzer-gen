    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb on surfaces. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi-pinnatifid, giving it a lacy appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its small, spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
