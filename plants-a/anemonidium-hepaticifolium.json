    "intro": "Anemonidium hepaticifolium, commonly known as the liverleaf anemonidium, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed, resembling the shape of a liver, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
