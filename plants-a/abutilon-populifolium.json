    "intro": "Abutilon populifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, spade-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in clusters.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon populifolium is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with desert and scrub habitats. Its native range includes areas with mild winters and hot, dry summers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon populifolium was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its attractive, broad leaves and showy flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in moist, disturbed areas such as stream banks and forest edges. It is considered an invasive species in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites, posing challenges for local ecosystems."
