    "intro": "Araeococcus micranthus, commonly known as the small-flowered rock moss, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores for propagation. Due to its compact size and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid, tropical regions."
