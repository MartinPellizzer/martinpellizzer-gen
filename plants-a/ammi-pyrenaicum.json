    "intro": "Ammi pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean cow-wheat, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its life cycle is adapted to cold climates, with flowering occurring in late spring to early summer. Ammi pyrenaicum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude environments."
