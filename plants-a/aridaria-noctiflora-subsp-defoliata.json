    "intro": "Aridaria noctiflora subsp. defoliata, commonly known as the night-blooming desert bell, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, leathery leaves that reduce water loss and are often shed during periods of extreme drought. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
