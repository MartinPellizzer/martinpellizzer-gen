    "intro": "Acrostichum versatile, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a sturdy, trunk-like structure covered in a thick, fibrous layer called the rachis. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of branching, giving it a lush, fern-like appearance. Acrostichum versatile is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments.",
