    "intro": "Acacia biceps, commonly known as the two-armed acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has bipinnate leaves, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or golden, arranged in dense, branched inflorescences. Acacia biceps is adapted to arid environments and is often found in savannas and rocky areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia biceps is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia biceps is also known for its distinctive bipinnate leaves and yellow flower clusters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia biceps was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, often found in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has been introduced for ornamental purposes and as a potential source of timber or fuel. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and environmental suitability."
