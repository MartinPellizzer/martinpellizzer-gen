    "intro": "Aciphyllaea, commonly known as the silverleaf or mountain silver, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Myrtaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, and the flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences. Aciphyllaea species are native to Australia and New Zealand, where they often grow in rocky or alpine environments. These plants are adapted to harsh conditions, making them resilient and hardy in their native habitats."
