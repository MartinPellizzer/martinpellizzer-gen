    "intro": "Antennaria modesta, commonly known as the common mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and hairy, with white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Antennaria modesta is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
