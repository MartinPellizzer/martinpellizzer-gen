It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties."
