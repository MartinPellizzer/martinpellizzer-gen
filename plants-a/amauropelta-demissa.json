    "intro": "Amauropelta demissa, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a soft, velvety texture and a unique, almost metallic sheen. Amauropelta demissa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, organic soil."
