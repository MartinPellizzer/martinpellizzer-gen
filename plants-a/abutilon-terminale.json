    "intro": "Abutilon terminale, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Chinese lantern plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of lantern-shaped, orange-red bracts that resemble small lanterns. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the showy bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Abutilon terminale is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon terminale is primarily native to Argentina Northeast, Argentina Northwest, Brazil South, and Uruguay. This plant is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates and is often associated with riverbanks and coastal areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, where it can grow as a shrub or small tree. The species is well adapted to the varied ecosystems of these regions, including grasslands and forests. Its native distribution reflects its preference for well-drained soils and ample sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon terminale was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate a range of light conditions. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Its presence can outcompete native vegetation, altering local ecosystems."
