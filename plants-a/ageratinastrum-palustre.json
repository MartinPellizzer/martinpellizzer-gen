    "intro": "Ageratinastrum palustre, commonly known as swamp fleabane, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist soils along the edges of marshes, ponds, and streams. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center. It blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ageratinastrum palustre is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
