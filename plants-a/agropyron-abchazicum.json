    "intro": "Agropyron abchazicum, commonly known as the Abchazian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Agropyron abchazicum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
