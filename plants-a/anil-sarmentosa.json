    "intro": "Anil sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a valuable ornamental plant and a potential weed in cultivated areas. Anil sarmentosa is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
