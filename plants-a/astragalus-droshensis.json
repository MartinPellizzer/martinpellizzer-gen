    "intro": "Astragalus droshensis, commonly known as the Drosh Mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting features such as a deep root system and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its arid habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
