It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy stems, with compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by pods containing one to three seeds. It is closely related to cultivated peanuts and has been studied for its potential in crop improvement. Its botanical features make it an important subject in the taxonomy and genetics of the Arachis genus."
