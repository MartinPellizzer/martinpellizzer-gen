    "intro": "Aspidium paleaceum var. majus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, rounded pinnae that aid in water retention. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
