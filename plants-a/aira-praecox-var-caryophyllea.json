    "intro": "Aira praecox var. caryophyllea, commonly known as the redstem false oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more reddish in color as the plant matures. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
