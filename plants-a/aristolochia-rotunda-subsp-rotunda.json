    "intro": "Aristolochia rotunda subsp. rotunda, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a concern for livestock and humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and chemical composition have made it a subject of both botanical and pharmacological interest."
