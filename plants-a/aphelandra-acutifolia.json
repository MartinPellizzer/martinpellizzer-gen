    "intro": "Aphelandra acutifolia, commonly known as the flame bamboo or sacred bamboo, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, dark green leaves with a glossy surface and a subtle sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. Aphelandra acutifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
