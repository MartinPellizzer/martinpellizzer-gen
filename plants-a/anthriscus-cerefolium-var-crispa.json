    "intro": "Anthriscus cerefolium var. crispa, commonly known as curly parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that are often curled or crisped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or meadows. Curly parsley is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its mild, parsley-like flavor, making it a popular choice in gardens and culinary use."
