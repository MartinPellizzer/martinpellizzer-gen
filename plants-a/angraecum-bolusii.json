    "intro": "Angraecum bolusii, commonly known as the Bolus's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features tall, slender pseudobulbs that support its evergreen, strap-like leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant inflorescences with white and violet flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific moths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air circulation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
