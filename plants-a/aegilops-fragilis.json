    "intro": "Aegilops fragilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic relationship with wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and botanical research."
