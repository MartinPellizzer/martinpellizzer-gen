    "intro": "Astragalus cutleri, commonly known as the Cutler's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Astragalus cutleri is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
