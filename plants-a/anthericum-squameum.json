    "intro": "Anthericum squameum, commonly known as the scaly lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a distinctive scaly texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Anthericum squameum is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
