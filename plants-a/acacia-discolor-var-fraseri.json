    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia discolor var. fraseri is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of Australia, including New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and heathlands. This variant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of these areas, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. It is often seen along coastal areas and in the foothills of mountain ranges. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia discolor var. fraseri was mainly introduced to the eastern and southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in these regions. The plant has been reported in several states including Texas, Florida, and Georgia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
