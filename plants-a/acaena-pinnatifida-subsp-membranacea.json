    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. membranacea, commonly known as the coastal brambles or New Zealand thistles, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its prickly, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces persistent, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. It thrives in coastal and subantarctic environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range.",

It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Andes mountain range. This subspecies thrives in dry to moist grasslands, shrublands, and rocky slopes. It is often associated with coastal and inland areas where the climate is relatively cool and arid. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida subsp. membranacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. It has become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some regions. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species."
