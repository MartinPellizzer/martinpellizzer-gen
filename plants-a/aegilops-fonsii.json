    "intro": "Aegilops fonsii, commonly known as the wild einkorn wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the tribe Aveneae within the grass family Poaceae. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which is characteristic of the tribe. Aegilops fonsii is closely related to cultivated wheat species and has been studied for its potential in genetic research and breeding programs."
