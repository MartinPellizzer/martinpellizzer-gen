    "intro": "Athrixia rosmarinifolia var. foliosa, commonly known as the foliate rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low and compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. The species is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
