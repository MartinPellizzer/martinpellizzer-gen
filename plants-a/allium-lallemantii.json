    "intro": "Allium lallemantii, commonly known as the Lallemand's onion, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern France. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous base and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in a tight cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Allium lallemantii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
