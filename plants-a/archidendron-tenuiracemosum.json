    "intro": "Archidendron tenuiracemosum, commonly known as the slender-branch legume, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant features compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The plant is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
