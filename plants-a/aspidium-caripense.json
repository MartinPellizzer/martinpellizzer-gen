    "intro": "Aspidium caripense, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium caripense plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
