    "intro": "Amblirion album, commonly known as the moonlight fern, is a rare and delicate plant characterized by its silvery-white fronds that shimmer under sunlight. It is native to the misty highlands of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity. The plant's leaves are elongated and feather-like, with a unique arrangement that allows for efficient light absorption. Its flowers, though small, are pale yellow and appear in clusters, adding to its ethereal appearance. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Amblirion album is considered a conservation concern."
