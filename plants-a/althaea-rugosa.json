    "intro": "Althaea rugosa, commonly known as the downy mullein, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces showy, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Althaea rugosa is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its soothing properties."
