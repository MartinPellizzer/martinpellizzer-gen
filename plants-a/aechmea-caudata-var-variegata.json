    "intro": "Aechmea caudata var. variegata, commonly known as the Variegated Sword Fern, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, upright inflorescence that bears vibrant red bracts, which contrast beautifully with its dark green, strap-like leaves. The plant's rosette of leaves forms a central cup that collects rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
