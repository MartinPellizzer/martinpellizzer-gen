It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are elliptical in shape, hence the species name, and are arranged in a rosette pattern. Anthonotha elliptica is typically found in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories."
