    "intro": "Atriplex procumbens, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Atriplex procumbens is often found in dunes, salt marshes, and other saline or dry habitats."
