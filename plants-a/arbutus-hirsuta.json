    "intro": "Arbutus hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and birds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Arbutus hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
