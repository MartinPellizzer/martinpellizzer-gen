    "intro": "Azolla pinnata, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae. It is characterized by its small, water-filled fronds that form a dense mat on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to its rapid growth. Azolla pinnata thrives in warm, shallow waters and is often found in rice paddies and marshy areas. Its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen makes it an important plant in aquatic ecosystems."
