    "intro": "Atriplex acanthocarpa, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts and coastal dunes. Atriplex acanthocarpa is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh landscapes."
