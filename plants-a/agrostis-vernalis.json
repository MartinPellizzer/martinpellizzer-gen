    "intro": "Agrostis vernalis, commonly known as spring bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue when fresh. Agrostis vernalis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
