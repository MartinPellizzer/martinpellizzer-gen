    "intro": "Astragalus paliurus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or pale pink pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh, sandy soils. Astragalus paliurus plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
