    "intro": "Anemone baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal anemone, is a perennial herb native to the Lake Baikal region in Siberia. It features a short, stout rootstock and produces a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant blooms with showy, pinkish-white to pale purple flowers that have five to nine petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
