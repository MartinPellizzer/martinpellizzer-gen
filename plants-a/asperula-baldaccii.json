    "intro": "Asperula baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Asperula baldaccii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
