    "intro": "Allocarya asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Allocarya asperula is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils."
