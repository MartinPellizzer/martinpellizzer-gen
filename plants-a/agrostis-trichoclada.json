    "intro": "Agrostis trichoclada, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis trichoclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
