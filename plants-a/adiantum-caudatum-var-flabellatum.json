It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically a vibrant green, with a distinctive fan-shaped appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a preference for well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a soft blue glow, which is a unique characteristic among ferns. This variety is prized for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
