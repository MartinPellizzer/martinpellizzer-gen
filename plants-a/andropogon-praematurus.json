    "intro": "Andropogon praematurus, commonly known as early bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomes allow it to form dense stands, making it a valuable species for erosion control and wildlife habitat. Andropogon praematurus is also an important forage plant for livestock."
