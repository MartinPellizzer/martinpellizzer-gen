    "intro": "Acer trifidum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf maple, is a variant of the three-lobed maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, undivided margins on its leaves, distinguishing it from the typical trifidum variety. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
