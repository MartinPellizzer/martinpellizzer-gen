    "intro": "Aster baccharoides, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features a sprawling growth habit with silvery-gray foliage that reflects light, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to lavender flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance and cold hardiness. Aster baccharoides thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
