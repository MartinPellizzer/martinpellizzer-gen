    "intro": "Allocarya calycosa, commonly known as the calycosa bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, leafless shoots that often bear tiny, bladder-like structures used for capturing prey. The plant is typically found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale pink, with four petals and a distinctive calyx. Allocarya calycosa is a carnivorous plant that supplements its nutrient intake by trapping and digesting small aquatic organisms."
