    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema dalatensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. It is commonly found in the mountainous areas of the Central Highlands and the northern provinces of the country. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage. However, it remains relatively rare in the wild due to habitat loss and limited distribution.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema dalatensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and fallow lands. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Its rapid growth and adaptability have made it a potential invasive species in some regions. However, its ecological impact is still being studied."
