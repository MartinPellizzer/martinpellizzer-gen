    "intro": "Angraecum firthii, commonly known as the Firth's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant produces its flowers at night, a trait that aligns with its pollination by the hawkmoth, which is active during the evening. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that help it thrive in the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat. Angraecum firthii is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity."
