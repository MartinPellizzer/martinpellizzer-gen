    "intro": "Adelopetalum lilianae, commonly known as the Lilian's bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Adelopetalum lilianae is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats.",
