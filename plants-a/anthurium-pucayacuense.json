    "intro": "Anthurium pucayacuense, commonly known as the Pucayacuense arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon Basin of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
