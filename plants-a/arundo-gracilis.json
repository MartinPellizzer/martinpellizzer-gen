    "intro": "Arundo gracilis, commonly known as slender reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 feet in height. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in dense panicles during the summer months. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it is often considered an invasive species in non-native regions."
