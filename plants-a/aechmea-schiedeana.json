    "intro": "Aechmea schiedeana, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and may have a reddish or purplish hue on the underside. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late spring or early summer. Aechmea schiedeana is well adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
