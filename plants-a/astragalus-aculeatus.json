    "intro": "Astragalus aculeatus, commonly known as the prickly milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems that often branch near the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus aculeatus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in dry grasslands and rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
