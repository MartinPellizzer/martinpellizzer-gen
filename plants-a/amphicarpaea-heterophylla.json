    "intro": "Amphicarpaea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf cowpea, is a flowering plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique ability to produce two types of fruits: one above ground and one below ground, a trait known as amphicarpous growth. The plant exhibits significant morphological variation in leaf shape and size, which contributes to its common name. Its flowers are typically small and white or pale purple, arranged in clusters along the stems. This species is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
