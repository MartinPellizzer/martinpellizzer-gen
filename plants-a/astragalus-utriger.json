    "intro": "Astragalus utriger, commonly known as the Utah milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively."
