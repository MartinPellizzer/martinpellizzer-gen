    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. ochroleuca, commonly known as white agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits known as achenes, which are typically covered in soft, white hairs. White agrimony thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. It has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
