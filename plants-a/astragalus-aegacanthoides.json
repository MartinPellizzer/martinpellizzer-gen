    "intro": "Astragalus aegacanthoides, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded lands."
