    "intro": "Anatropa, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Araceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spadix-like inflorescence and waxy, evergreen leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Anatropa species are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
