    "intro": "Athyrium pycnosorum, commonly known as the dense-ferns, is a species of fern native to the forests of East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that often form a rosette shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring rich, humus-filled soil. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lush, fern-like appearance. Athyrium pycnosorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shady garden settings."
