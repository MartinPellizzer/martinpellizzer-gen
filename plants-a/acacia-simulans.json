    "intro": "Acacia simulans, commonly known as the mimic acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia simulans is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia simulans is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the region's arid and semi-arid areas, particularly in the coastal and inland zones. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate periods of drought. Acacia simulans plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia simulans was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide shade in degraded lands. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, quarries, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought-resistant properties. Its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen make it useful for soil stabilization. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
