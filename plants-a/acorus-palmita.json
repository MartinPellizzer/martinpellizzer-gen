    "intro": "Acorus palmita, commonly known as the broadleaf sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It features long, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spadices, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. Acorus palmita is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological roles in wetland ecosystems.",
