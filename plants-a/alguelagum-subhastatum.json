    "intro": "Alguelagum subhastatum, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a robust root system adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Alguelagum subhastatum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
