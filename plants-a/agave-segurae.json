    "intro": "Agave segurae, commonly known as the Segura agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, greenish-white flowers. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
