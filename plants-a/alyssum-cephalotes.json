    "intro": "Alyssum cephalotes, commonly known as the mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum cephalotes is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
