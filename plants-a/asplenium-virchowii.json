    "intro": "Asplenium virchowii, commonly known as the Virchow's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are characterized by a distinct midrib. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium virchowii is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
