    "intro": "Allophylus quercifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of oak trees, and its small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are a food source for various wildlife species. It is often found in moist, tropical environments and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming an invasive species."
