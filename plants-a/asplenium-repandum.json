    "intro": "Asplenium repandum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it thrives in moist, acidic soil. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery fronds that are deeply divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive linear pattern. Asplenium repandum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
