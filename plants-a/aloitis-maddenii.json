    "intro": "Aloitis maddenii, commonly known as the Madden's Aloes, is a unique succulent native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is adapted to sandy soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
