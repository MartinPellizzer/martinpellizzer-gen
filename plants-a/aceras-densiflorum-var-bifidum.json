It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with a distinctive split at the base of the petals. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and ecologically valuable species in arid and semi-arid environments.",
