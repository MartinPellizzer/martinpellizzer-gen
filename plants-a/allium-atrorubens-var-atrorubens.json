    "intro": "Allium atrorubens var. atrorubens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features tall, slender stems that are typically tinged with purple, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible, though they are generally smaller and less commonly cultivated than other onion varieties. The leaves are grass-like, with a mild onion scent, and the plant is often grown for ornamental purposes in gardens."
