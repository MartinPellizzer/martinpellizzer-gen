    "intro": "Armeniaca \u00d7 nigra, commonly known as the black cherry. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Prunus serotina (wild cherry). This plant is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which give way to dark red to black cherries in the summer. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its edible fruits."
