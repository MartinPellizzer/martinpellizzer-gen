It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. It produces a single, erect stem that can reach up to 1 meter in height. Aethusa bunius is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
