    "intro": "Avena depauperata, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that develop in spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. Avena depauperata is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
