    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. obtusata, commonly known as the sticky alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often sticky to the touch. The plant produces small, clustered catkins in early spring, which are male and female, with the female catkins developing into small, winged fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in riparian zones, wetlands, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
