    "intro": "Agave \u00d7 guemensis, commonly known as the blue agave, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette pattern. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear small, white to greenish flowers. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Agave \u00d7 guemensis is also valued for its use in the production of tequila and other agave-based spirits."
