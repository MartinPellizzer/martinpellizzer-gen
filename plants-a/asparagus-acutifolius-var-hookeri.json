It features slender, spiny stems and small, fern-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid climates."
