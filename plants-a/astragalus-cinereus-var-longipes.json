    "intro": "Astragalus cinereus var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cinereous milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
