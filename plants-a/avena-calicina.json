    "intro": "Avena calicina, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avena calicina thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in natural landscapes."
