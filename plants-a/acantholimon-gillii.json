    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon gillii is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited soil conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon gillii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed habitats. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It has a low water requirement, making it suitable for xeriscaping and sustainable landscaping. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
