    "intro": "Asplenium setoi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium setoi is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid forests, where it absorbs moisture from the air."
