    "intro": "Alopecurus arundinaceus subsp. exserens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
