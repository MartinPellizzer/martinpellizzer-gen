    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens var. glabrata, commonly known as carpet bugle or silver carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rounded, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose spikes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
