It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
