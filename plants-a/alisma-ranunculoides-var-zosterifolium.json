    "intro": "Alisma ranunculoides var. zosterifolium, commonly known as the ribbonleaf water plantain, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves and stems are typically covered in a fine, waxy coating that helps reduce water loss."
