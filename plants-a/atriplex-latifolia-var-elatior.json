    "intro": "Atriplex latifolia var. elatior, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its broad, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, contributing to its resilience in dry conditions."
