    "intro": "Aechmea glomerata var. pallida, commonly known as the pale pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, waxy, pale green leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces an inflorescence with vivid red bracts and yellow flowers, making it a popular ornamental species. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and high humidity. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
