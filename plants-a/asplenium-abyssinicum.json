    "intro": "Asplenium abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian spleenwort, is a fern native to Ethiopia and other parts of East Africa. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium abyssinicum is part of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its simple, non-branching fronds. It plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
