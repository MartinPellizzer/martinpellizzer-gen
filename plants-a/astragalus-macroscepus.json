    "intro": "Astragalus macroscepus, commonly known as the large-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Astragalus macroscepus thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments."
