    "intro": "Arundinaria hsienchuensis var. subglabrata, commonly known as the Hsienchu bamboo, is a rare and endemic species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that grow in dense clumps. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often glabrous or nearly hairless, giving it a smooth texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in mountainous regions with a humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
