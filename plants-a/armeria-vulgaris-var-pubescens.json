    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy thrift, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to coastal areas of Europe. It features dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of silver-gray, fuzzy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and can tolerate salt spray. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
