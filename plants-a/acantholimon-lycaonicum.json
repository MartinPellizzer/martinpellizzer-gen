    "intro": "Acantholimon lycaonicum, commonly known as the Lycaonicum thimbleweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with silver-blue foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon lycaonicum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the eastern and southeastern areas. This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous regions. It is adapted to the dry and harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain localities in Turkey, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon lycaonicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or Mediterranean climates. It is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and disturbed soils where it can establish quickly. This plant thrives in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of California and the western United States. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species that does not pose significant ecological threats."
