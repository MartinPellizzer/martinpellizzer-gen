    "intro": "Ascarina solmsiana var. solmsiana, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, edible seeds. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for construction and furniture-making due to its strength and durability. The plant also plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
