    "intro": "Antennaria obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are typically oval or oblong in shape. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and foliage that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Antennaria obovata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
