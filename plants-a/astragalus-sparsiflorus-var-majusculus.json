    "intro": "Astragalus sparsiflorus var. majusculus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is also notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth and fewer flowers compared to the typical form of Astragalus sparsiflorus."
