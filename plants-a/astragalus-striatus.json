    "intro": "Astragalus striatus, commonly known as the stripe milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus striatus is also valued for its role in supporting local pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
