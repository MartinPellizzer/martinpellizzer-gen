    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal asparagus, is a variant of the common asparagus that thrives in coastal environments. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, fern-like leaves that are adapted to tolerate salty air and wind. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible, needle-like spears that are harvested before they fully develop. It is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. This variety is valued for its hardiness and its use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
