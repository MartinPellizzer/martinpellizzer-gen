    "intro": "Acinodendron peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, often accompanied by elliptical, leathery leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and lesser-known species within its family.",
