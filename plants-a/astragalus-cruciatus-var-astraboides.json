    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus var. astraboides, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has compound leaves with several pairs of leaflets. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
