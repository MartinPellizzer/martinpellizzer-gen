    "intro": "Agrostis reptans, commonly known as\u530d\u5310\u526a\u80a1\u9896, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically inconspicuous. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of natural grasslands and meadows. Agrostis reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
