    "intro": "Andrachne schaffneriana, commonly known as the Schaffner's sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its adaptations to drought include thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and deep root systems for accessing moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
