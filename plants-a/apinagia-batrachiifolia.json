It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that resemble a frog's foot, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are usually basal, opposite, and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are blue to violet in color. Apinagia batrachiifolia is often found in open, sunny areas and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its high-altitude environment."
