    "intro": "Aegiphila minima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandverbena, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged opposite each other. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
