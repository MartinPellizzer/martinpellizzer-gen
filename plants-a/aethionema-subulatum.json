    "intro": "Aethionema subulatum, commonly known as the cushion saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, adding a bright touch to its rocky habitat. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it an attractive and hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
