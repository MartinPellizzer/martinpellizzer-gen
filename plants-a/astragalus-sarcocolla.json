    "intro": "Astragalus sarcocolla, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus sarcocolla is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes."
