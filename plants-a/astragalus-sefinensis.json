    "intro": "Astragalus sefinensis, commonly known as the Sefin Mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
