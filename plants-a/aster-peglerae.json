    "intro": "Aster peglerae, commonly known as the Pegler's aster, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or open habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aster peglerae is considered a rare and endangered species."
