It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize wetland areas effectively. Its fronds are divided into segments that are connected by jointed stalks, giving it a distinctive appearance. Acrostichum articulatum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms.",
