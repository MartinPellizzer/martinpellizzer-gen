    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. argutum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaf margins, which set it apart from the smoother leaves of the typical species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. The foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn, making it a notable ornamental plant.",
