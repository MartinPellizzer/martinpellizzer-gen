    "intro": "Anisomeris caurensis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Anisomeris caurensis thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. It plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
