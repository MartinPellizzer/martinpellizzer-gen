    "intro": "Amphinomia stipulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a flowering plant species native to parts of Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as swampy areas and creek margins. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces distinctive, three-angled seeds. Amphinomia stipulosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
