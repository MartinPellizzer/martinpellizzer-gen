    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata subsp. calotheca, commonly known as coast sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to saline and arid environments. This subspecies is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion."
