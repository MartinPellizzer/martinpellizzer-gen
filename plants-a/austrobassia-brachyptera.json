    "intro": "Austrobassia brachyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved grevillea, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater sources. Austrobassia brachyptera plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
