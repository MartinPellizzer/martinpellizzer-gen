    "intro": "Arawakia divesora, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom throughout the rainy season. The plant has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to anchor it in the rich, organic soil of the forest floor. Arawakia divesora is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in local medicine."
