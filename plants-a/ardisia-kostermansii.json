    "intro": "Ardisia kostermansii, commonly known as the Kostermans' ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to the island of Mindanao in the Philippines and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, red berries. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub in tropical rainforests, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are borne in small clusters, while its fruit is an important food source for various bird species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in protected areas."
