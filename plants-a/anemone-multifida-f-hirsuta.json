    "intro": "Anemone multifida f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy anemone, is a variant of the multifid anemone characterized by its hairy or pubescent foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, typically found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a silvery or grayish hue due to the dense covering of fine hairs. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
