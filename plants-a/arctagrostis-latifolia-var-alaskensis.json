    "intro": "Arctagrostis latifolia var. alaskensis, commonly known as the Alaska wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. Its adaptability to cold climates makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects in alpine and arctic regions."
