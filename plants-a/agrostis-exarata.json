    "intro": "Agrostis exarata, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny grains. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its rapid growth rate. Agrostis exarata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
