    "intro": "Adiantum \u00d7 janzenianum, commonly known as the Janzen's maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Adiantum capillus-veneris and Adiantum capillus-veneris var. capillus-veneris. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Adiantum \u00d7 janzenianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
