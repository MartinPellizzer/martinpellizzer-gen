    "intro": "Androsace alba, commonly known as the white rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually oval or heart-shaped, with a velvety texture, and it is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Androsace alba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
