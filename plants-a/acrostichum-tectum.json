    "intro": "Acrostichum tectum, commonly known as the broad-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple subdivisions. Acrostichum tectum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.",
