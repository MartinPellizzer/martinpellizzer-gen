    "intro": "Astragalus medorum, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie habitats. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus medorum is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid environments."
