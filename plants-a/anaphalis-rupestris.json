    "intro": "Anaphalis rupestris, commonly known as the rock anaphalis, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and fluffy, cloud-like inflorescences that resemble cotton. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and gravelly soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom during the summer months. Anaphalis rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
