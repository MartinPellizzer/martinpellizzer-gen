    "intro": "Atropa dependens, commonly known as the hanging belladonna, is a species of nightshade plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, pendulous flowers that resemble small bells, typically ranging in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant produces dark, glossy berries that contain toxic alkaloids, similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Atropa dependens thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
