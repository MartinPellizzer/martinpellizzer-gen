    "intro": "Acetosella tomentosa, commonly known as woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white or gray hairs on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky soils. Acetosella tomentosa is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine.",
