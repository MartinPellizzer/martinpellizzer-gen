    "intro": "Arenaria ligericina var. canescens, commonly known as the silver sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring. The leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving the plant its distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
