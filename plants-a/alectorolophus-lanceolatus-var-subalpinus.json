    "intro": "Alectorolophus lanceolatus var. subalpinus, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to the typical form of A. lanceolatus."
