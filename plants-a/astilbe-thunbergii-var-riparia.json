    "intro": "Astilbe thunbergii var. riparia, commonly known as the river astilbe, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features upright, fern-like foliage that provides a lush backdrop for its delicate, plume-like flower clusters. The flowers, which bloom in shades of pink to white, appear in late spring to early summer. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense clumps over time."
