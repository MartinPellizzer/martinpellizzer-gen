It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of pink to lavender flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus dipsaceus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
