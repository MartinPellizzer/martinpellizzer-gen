    "intro": "Astragalus desereticus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish or greenish pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus desereticus is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in low-water conditions."
