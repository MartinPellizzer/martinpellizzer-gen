    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. gallica, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bright white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden use in maritime climates. The subspecies gallica is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to other subspecies of Armeria maritima."
