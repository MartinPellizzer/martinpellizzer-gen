    "intro": "Asclepias semilunata, commonly known as the moonflower milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
