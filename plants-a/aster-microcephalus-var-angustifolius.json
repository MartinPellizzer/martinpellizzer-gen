It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than an inch wide, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
