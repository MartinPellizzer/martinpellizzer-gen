    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon garckei is primarily native to parts of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas and near riverbanks. Its distribution is largely limited to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon garckei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there by horticulturalists or gardeners seeking to add visual interest to landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying landscapes and posing ecological risks."
