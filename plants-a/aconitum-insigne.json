    "intro": "Aconitum insigne, commonly known as the noble aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aconitum insigne is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it both a dangerous plant and a valuable subject in botanical and pharmacological studies.",
