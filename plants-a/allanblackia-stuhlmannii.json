    "intro": "Allanblackia stuhlmannii, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical plant native to western and central Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by fruit that resembles a large, spiky capsule. The seeds inside the fruit are rich in oils, which are used in cosmetics and food products. Its botanical significance lies in its unique oil composition and ecological role in its native habitats."
