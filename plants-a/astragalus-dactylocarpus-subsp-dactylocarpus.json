    "intro": "Astragalus dactylocarpus subsp. dactylocarpus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It has deep taproots that allow it to survive in drought conditions, making it well-suited for xeric environments. This subspecies is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
