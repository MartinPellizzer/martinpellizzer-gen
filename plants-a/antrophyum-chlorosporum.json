    "intro": "Antrophyum chlorosporum, commonly known as the green-spored antrophyum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are green rather than the usual brown or black found in many other ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique spore coloration, it is of particular interest to botanists studying spore morphology and plant evolution."
