    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. alpinifolia, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
