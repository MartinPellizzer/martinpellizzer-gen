    "intro": "Anactinia hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's sea anemone, is a marine polyp belonging to the family Actinidae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent tentacles that surround a central oral disc, used for capturing prey. This species typically inhabits shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocky substrates. Its body is relatively simple, consisting of a gastrovascular cavity and a ring of nematocysts-equipped tentacles. Anactinia hookeri plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
