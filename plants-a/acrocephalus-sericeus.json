    "intro": "Acrocephalus sericeus, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in wetland environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, silver-tomentose leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in maintaining wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in conservation areas.",
