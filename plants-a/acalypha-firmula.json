    "intro": "Acalypha firmula, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are usually covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Acalypha firmula is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in some areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha firmula is primarily native to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Southeast, Mexico Southwest, and Nicaragua. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open habitats. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in local horticulture. Its native range spans across Central America, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha firmula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself in native habitats, posing a risk to local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a concern for land managers. Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to control its spread to protect biodiversity."
