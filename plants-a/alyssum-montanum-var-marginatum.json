    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. marginatum, commonly known as the Sierra wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are linear to lance-shaped, often with a silvery or grayish underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The variety 'marginatum' is distinguished by its distinctive margins on the leaves, which are often a different color from the central part."
