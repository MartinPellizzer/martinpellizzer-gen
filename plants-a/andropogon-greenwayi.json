    "intro": "Andropogon greenwayi, commonly known as Greenway's bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive blue-gray hue, which helps in identifying it from other grasses. Andropogon greenwayi plays an important ecological role in supporting wetland biodiversity."
