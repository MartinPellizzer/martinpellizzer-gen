    "intro": "Androsace rotundifolia var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf pink or alpine pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of broad, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hair. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or magenta flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
