    "intro": "Asarum subglobosum, commonly known as the globular asarum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a unique, umbel-like structure. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time."
