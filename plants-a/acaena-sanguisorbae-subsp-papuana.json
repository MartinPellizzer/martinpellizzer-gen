    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. papuana, commonly known as the Papuan bentthorn, is a species native to New Guinea. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, reddish-brown seeds enclosed in prickly burrs, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories. The subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.",

It is found in the lowland and montane regions of the island, particularly in moist, shaded forest understories. This subspecies is commonly associated with humid tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives in areas with well-drained to moderately wet soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within New Guinea's diverse ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. papuana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental or horticultural purposes. This subspecies is now considered an environmental weed in certain areas of New Zealand. It spreads readily in disturbed soils and can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns regarding its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
