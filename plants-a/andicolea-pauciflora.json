    "intro": "Andicolea pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered andicolea, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family, native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in fine trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
