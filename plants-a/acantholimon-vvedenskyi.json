    "intro": "Acantholimon vvedenskyi, commonly known as the Vvedensky's thornweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or steppe areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon vvedenskyi was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This species has been reported in several European countries, including Spain, Italy, and France. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to invade native habitats and compete with local flora. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions."
