    "intro": "Alectryon coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alectryon, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange to red, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alectryon coriaceus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade."
