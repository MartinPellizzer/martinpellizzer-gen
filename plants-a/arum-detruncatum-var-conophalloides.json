    "intro": "Arum detruncatum var. conophalloides, commonly known as the dwarf arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a reddish or purple tint on the underside. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spathe, which is usually white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate water conditions."
