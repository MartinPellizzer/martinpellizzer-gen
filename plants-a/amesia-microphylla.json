It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Amesia microphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
