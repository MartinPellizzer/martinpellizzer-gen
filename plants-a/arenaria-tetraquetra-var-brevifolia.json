It is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. It is often found in tundra and mountain meadow habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
