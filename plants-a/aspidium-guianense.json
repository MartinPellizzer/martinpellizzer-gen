    "intro": "Aspidium guianense, commonly known as the Guianese water fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium guianense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
