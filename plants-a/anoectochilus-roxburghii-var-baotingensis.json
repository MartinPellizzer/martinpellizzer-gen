    "intro": "Anoectochilus roxburghii var. baotingensis, commonly known as the Baotingen orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often yellowish or reddish in color. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
