It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
