    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
