    "intro": "Armeria bourgaei subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, perennial plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid coastal habitat. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along cliffs, dunes, and rocky shores. Armeria bourgaei subsp. bourgaei is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh maritime environments."
