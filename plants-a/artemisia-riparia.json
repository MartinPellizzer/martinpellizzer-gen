    "intro": "Artemisia riparia, commonly known as narrowleaf sagebrush, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia riparia is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including drought and poor soil, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
