It is characterized by its dark green, wiry leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
