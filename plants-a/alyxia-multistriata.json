    "intro": "Alyxia multistriata, commonly known as the Florida holly or swamp holly, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, showing a preference for moist, acidic soils. The plant features opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. Its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters and are often followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Alyxia multistriata is valued for its ecological role in providing food and habitat for wildlife in its native wetland environments."
