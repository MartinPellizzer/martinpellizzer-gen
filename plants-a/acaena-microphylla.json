    "intro": "Acaena microphylla, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, woolly leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces bracts that form a spiny, spherical structure, which helps protect its seeds. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and coastal areas. Acaena microphylla is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments.",
