    "intro": "Allium niveum, commonly known as the snow onion or white leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of broad, fleshy, white to pale green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces upright, cylindrical flower stalks topped with small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor, making it a valuable crop in certain regions. Allium niveum is adapted to cold climates and is often cultivated for both its culinary and ornamental value."
