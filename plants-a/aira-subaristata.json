    "intro": "Aira subaristata, commonly known as the slender airgrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of East Asia, including China and Japan. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and a rhizomatous growth habit, which helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
