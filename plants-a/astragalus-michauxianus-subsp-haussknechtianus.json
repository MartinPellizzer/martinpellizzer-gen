It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds.
