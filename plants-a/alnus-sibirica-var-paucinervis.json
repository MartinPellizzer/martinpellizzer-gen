    "intro": "Alnus sibirica var. paucinervis, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
