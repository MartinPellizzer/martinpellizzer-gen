    "intro": "Astragalus quercetorum, commonly known as the oak-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, and its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and woodland habitats. Astragalus quercetorum plays a role in nitrogen fixation and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
