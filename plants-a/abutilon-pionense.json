    "intro": "Abutilon pionense, commonly known as the golden abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Abutilon pionense is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pionense is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and moist lowland habitats. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its natural range extends to some regions of Central America as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pionense was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various coastal areas. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in urban environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
