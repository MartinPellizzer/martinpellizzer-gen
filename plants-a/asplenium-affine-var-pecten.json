    "intro": "Asplenium affine var. pecten, commonly known as the feather shield fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often divided into numerous small pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the plant through vegetative means. The leaves are usually evergreen, providing a lush green appearance throughout the growing season."
