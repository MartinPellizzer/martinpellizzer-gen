It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers and hairy, branched stems. The plant has lance-shaped, gray-green leaves with toothed margins, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Amsinckia dentata is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is known for its ornamental value and ecological importance to pollinators."
