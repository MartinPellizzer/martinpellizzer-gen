    "intro": "Androsace acaulis, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, compact rosettes of fleshy, often hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its succulent leaves and flowering pattern are adaptations to cold, windy, and nutrient-poor conditions. Androsace acaulis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky or well-drained soils."
