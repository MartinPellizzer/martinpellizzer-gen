    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. villosa, commonly known as the hairy thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
