    "intro": "Acer trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. Its flowers are small and yellow-green, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal changes.",
