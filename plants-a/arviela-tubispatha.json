    "intro": "Arviela tubispatha, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, pale purple petals that resemble the glow of moonlight, hence its common name. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves, and its flowers bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and threats from climate change, it is classified as an endangered species."
