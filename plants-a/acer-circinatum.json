    "intro": "Acer circinatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which are typically palmately lobed and turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes.",
