    "intro": "Andrachne cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are heart-shaped, providing it with efficient water storage capabilities. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Andrachne cordifolia is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
