    "intro": "Agave aurea, commonly known as the golden agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a striking yellowish hue along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellow to orange flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
