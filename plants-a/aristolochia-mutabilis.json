    "intro": "Aristolochia mutabilis, commonly known as the variable Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, often fragrant flowers that change color as they mature. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when ripe. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant has a complex relationship with its environment. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
