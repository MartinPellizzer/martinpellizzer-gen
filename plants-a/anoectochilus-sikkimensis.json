    "intro": "Anoectochilus sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves and produces showy, violet to purple flowers with a distinctive slipper-shaped pouch. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in some regions."
