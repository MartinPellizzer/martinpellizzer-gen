    "intro": "Agropyron desertorum var. typicum, commonly known as the desert wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes."
