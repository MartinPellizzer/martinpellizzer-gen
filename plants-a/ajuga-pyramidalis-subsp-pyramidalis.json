    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis subsp. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramid bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with dark green, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
