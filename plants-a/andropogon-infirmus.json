    "intro": "Andropogon infirmus, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with purple or pink. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon infirmus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
