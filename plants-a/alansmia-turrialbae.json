    "intro": "Alansmia turrialbae, commonly known as the Turrialba alansmia, is a flowering plant native to the humid highlands of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. Alansmia turrialbae is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its montane habitat."
