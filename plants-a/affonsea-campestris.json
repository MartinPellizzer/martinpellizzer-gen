    "intro": "Affonsea campestris, commonly known as the field sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has grass-like leaves that are usually narrow and linear, with a fibrous root system. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets and bloom in early summer. Affonsea campestris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
