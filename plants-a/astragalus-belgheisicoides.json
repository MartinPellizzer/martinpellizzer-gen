    "intro": "Astragalus belgheisicoides, commonly known as the Belgian shieldpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that mature into rounded, shield-shaped seeds, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
