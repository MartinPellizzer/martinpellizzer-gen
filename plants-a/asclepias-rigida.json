    "intro": "Asclepias rigida, commonly known as green milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of vibrant green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its latex contains a milky sap, which is a key feature of the genus Asclepias. Green milkweed serves as a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the lifecycle of this iconic species."
