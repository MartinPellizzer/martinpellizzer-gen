    "intro": "Astragalus nigricans, commonly known as black milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, leathery pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Astragalus nigricans thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native range."
