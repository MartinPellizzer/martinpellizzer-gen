    "intro": "Aphelia cyperoides, commonly known as the marsh clubmoss, is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy areas in North America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features slender, branching stems covered with scale-like leaves, and it produces small, cone-like structures called strobili that contain spores. Aphelia cyperoides thrives in moist, acidic soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-poor environments."
