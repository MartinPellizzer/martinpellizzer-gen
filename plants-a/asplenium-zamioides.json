    "intro": "Asplenium zamioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, clustered fronds with a dark green, leathery texture. The plant typically has two types of fronds: sterile, which are elongated and often curved, and fertile, which are shorter and bear sporangia on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Asplenium zamioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
