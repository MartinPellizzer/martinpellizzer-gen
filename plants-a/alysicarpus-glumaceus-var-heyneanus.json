    "intro": "Alysicarpus glumaceus var. heyneanus, commonly known as the hairy sida, is a tropical annual herb native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers followed by hairy, three-lobed pods. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
