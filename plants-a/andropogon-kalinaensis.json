    "intro": "Andropogon kalinaensis, commonly known as the Kalina grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has long, narrow leaves with a prominent midrib and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Andropogon kalinaensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
