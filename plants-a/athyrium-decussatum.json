    "intro": "Athyrium decussatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stem. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Athyrium decussatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
