    "intro": "Argocoffea scandens, commonly known as the climbing coffee plant, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a woody vine that can grow up to several meters in length, often climbing trees or shrubs for support. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that contain seeds. Its leaves are typically ovate with a glossy surface and are arranged alternately along the stems. While not widely cultivated for coffee, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles."
