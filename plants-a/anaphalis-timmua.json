It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a clustered inflorescence, often mistaken for a single flower. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Anaphalis timmua is often found in meadows and rocky habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
