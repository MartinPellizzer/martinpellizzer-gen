    "intro": "Anaxetum, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous small florets arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Anaxetum thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and wet meadows. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
