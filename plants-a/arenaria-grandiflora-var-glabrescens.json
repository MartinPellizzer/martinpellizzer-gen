    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety 'glabrescens' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, setting it apart from other varieties of Arenaria grandiflora."
