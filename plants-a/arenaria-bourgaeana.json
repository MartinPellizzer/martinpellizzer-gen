    "intro": "Arenaria bourgaeana, commonly known as the Cape foveolata, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria bourgaeana is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
