    "intro": "Acer heldreichii subsp. trautvetteri, commonly known as the Trautvetter's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountainous regions.",
