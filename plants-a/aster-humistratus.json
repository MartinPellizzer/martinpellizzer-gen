    "intro": "Aster humistratus, commonly known as the swamp aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with purple to pink petals that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aster humistratus plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its wetland environment."
