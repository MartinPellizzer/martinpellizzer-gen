    "intro": "Agrostis caespitosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along stream banks. Agrostis caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management."
