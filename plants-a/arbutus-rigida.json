    "intro": "Arbutus rigida, commonly known as the Pacific madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are glossy and dark green, often with a waxy coating, and they turn orange or red in the autumn. Arbutus rigida thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
