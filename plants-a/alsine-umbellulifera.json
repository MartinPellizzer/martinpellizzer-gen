    "intro": "Alsine umbellulifera, commonly known as the woolly alsike, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its hairy, low-growing stems and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
