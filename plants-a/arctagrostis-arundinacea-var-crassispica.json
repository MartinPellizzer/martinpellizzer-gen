    "intro": "Arctagrostis arundinacea var. crassispica, commonly known as the roughawn or tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous foliage that forms clumps. The plant has stiff, wiry leaves with a rough texture, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in groups. It thrives in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in riparian zones. The variety crassispica is distinguished by its thick, coarse awns, which give it its common name."
