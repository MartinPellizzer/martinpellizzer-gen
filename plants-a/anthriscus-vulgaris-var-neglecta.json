    "intro": "Anthriscus vulgaris var. neglecta, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped (umbellate) clusters of small white flowers, which appear in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. Its stems are hairy and covered with reddish or purple spots, and they can reach heights of up to 3 meters. Due to its toxicity, it is considered an invasive species in many regions and requires caution when handling."
