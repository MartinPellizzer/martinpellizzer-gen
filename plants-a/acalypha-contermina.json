    "intro": "Acalypha contermina, commonly known as the flame bush, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by these vibrant, showy structures. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Acalypha contermina is a shrub that can grow up to several meters tall, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha contermina is primarily native to Peru. It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forested or shrubland habitats. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the cooler climates of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of Peru, where it grows in natural and semi-natural environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha contermina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by human activity, such as through horticultural trade or intentional planting. The plant has since become naturalized in some areas, thriving in the tropical climate. It is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered invasive in the region and poses minimal ecological threat."
