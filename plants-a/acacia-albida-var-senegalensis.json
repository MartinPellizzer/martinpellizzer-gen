    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia albida var. senegalensis is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is commonly found in savannas and semi-desert areas. This plant is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions and plays an important role in local ecosystems. It is often used for its timber, fuelwood, and as a source of fodder for livestock. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of water and soil conditions in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia albida var. senegalensis was mainly introduced to areas with semi-arid to arid climates, where it thrives in sandy or loamy soils. It is commonly found in savannas and woodland regions of sub-Saharan Africa. This plant is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful for soil improvement. It is also used for its edible pods and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has helped in land rehabilitation and pastoral management in certain regions."
