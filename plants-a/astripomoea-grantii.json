    "intro": "Astripomoea grantii, commonly known as the Grant's morning glory, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in the early morning. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and produces showy, often violet or blue, blossoms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is a climbing vine that can grow up to several meters in length, with hairy stems and tendrils that aid in its ascent. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
