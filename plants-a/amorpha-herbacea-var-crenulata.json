    "intro": "Amorpha herbacea var. crenulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wild indigo, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with alternate, pinnately compound leaves that have a distinctive crenulate or scalloped edge. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and its role in supporting pollinators."
