    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens f. infravallesia, commonly known as the silverleaf alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland margins or shaded rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, low-maintenance ground cover."
