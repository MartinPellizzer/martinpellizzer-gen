    "intro": "Astragalus savanatensis, commonly known as the savannah milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the grasslands of central and southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring slender stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the dry season. It has adapted to arid environments through deep root systems and drought-resistant foliage. Astragalus savanatensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
