    "intro": "Astragalus lanatus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Astragalus lanatus is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
