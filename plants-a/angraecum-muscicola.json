    "intro": "Angraecum muscicola, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender, white flowers with a distinctive star-like appearance, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a delicate, scrambling growth habit with hairy, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It requires specific conditions, including high humidity and cool temperatures, to thrive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
