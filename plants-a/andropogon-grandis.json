    "intro": "Andropogon grandis, commonly known as big bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the tallgrass prairies of North America. It is characterized by its blue-gray-green foliage and a distinctive, hollow stem that becomes more reddish in color as it matures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or brown, depending on the season. Big bluestem is well adapted to prairie environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. It plays a vital role in maintaining soil stability and supporting biodiversity in native grassland ecosystems."
