    "intro": "Allium montigenum, commonly known as the mountain garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but are less commonly cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers cool, temperate climates, often growing at high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is increasingly being cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
