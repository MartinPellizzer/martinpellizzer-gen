    "intro": "Androsace carnea var. puberula, commonly known as the pink snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
