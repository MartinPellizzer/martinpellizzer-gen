    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. suffrutescens, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer. The plant is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a common weed in cultivated areas. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
