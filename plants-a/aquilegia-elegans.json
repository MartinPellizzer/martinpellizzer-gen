    "intro": "Aquilegia elegans, commonly known as the elegant columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, palmately arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silky hair. Its root system consists of a fibrous network that helps it thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Aquilegia elegans is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
