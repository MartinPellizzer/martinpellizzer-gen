    "intro": "Aspidium hallieri, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that are typically divided into pinnate segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can access the necessary humidity and light. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among many fern species. Aspidium hallieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
