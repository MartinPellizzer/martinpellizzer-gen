    "intro": "Armeria longiaristata, commonly known as the long-stemmed thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and grass-like, while its stems are erect and often branched. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Armeria longiaristata is often used in coastal gardens for its hardiness and ornamental value."
