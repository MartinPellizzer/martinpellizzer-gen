    "intro": "Alyxia quinata, commonly known as the coastal alyxia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Alyxia quinata is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a hardy coastal species."
