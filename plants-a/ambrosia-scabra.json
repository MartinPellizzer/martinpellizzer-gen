    "intro": "Ambrosia scabra, commonly known as rough ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It produces small yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ambrosia scabra is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
