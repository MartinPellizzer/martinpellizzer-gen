    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema cyclosperma is primarily native to South America, particularly in the Amazon Basin and surrounding regions. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in humid tropical climates and is often associated with lowland rainforests. It is typically found in areas with rich, well-drained soils. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Amazonian region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema cyclosperma was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is commonly found in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate. The plant is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land clearing. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
