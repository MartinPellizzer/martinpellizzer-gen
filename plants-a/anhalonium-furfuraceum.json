    "intro": "Anhalonium furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy candelabra cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its branched, cylindrical stems that are covered in short, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Anhalonium furfuraceum is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
