It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
