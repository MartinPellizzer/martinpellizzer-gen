It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is thick and flaky, often exuding a strong, unpleasant odor when broken. Alseuosmia banksii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
