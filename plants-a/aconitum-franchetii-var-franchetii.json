    "intro": "Aconitum franchetii var. franchetii, commonly known as Franchet's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, sparsely branched clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the plant has a toxic reputation due to the presence of potent alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats.",
