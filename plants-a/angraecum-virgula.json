    "intro": "Angraecum virgula, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender, white or pale pink flowers that resemble stars, which bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, strap-like leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in high light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
