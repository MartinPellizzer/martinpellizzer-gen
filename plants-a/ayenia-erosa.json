    "intro": "Ayenia erosa, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pink to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. Ayenia erosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
