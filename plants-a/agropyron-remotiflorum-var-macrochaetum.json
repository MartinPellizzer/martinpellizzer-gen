    "intro": "Agropyron remotiflorum var. macrochaetum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in arid environments."
