It grows in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variant is commonly found in temperate forests and rocky slopes with well-drained soil. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and is often associated with secondary vegetation. The plant is part of the Araliaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax simonii var. longipedicellatus was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in forest margins, rocky slopes, and open woodlands, preferring areas with moderate moisture levels. This variety is valued for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It has been introduced to several parts of Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, where it is cultivated for horticultural purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
