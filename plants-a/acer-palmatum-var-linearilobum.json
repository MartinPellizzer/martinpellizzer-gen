    "intro": "Acer palmatum var. linearilobum, commonly known as the Japanese maple with linear lobes, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected, linearly lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has a compact, upright growth habit. It prefers partial shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its striking foliage rather than its flowers or fruits.",
