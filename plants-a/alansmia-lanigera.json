    "intro": "Alansmia lanigera, commonly known as the wooly alansmia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is often found in open habitats such as slopes and canyons. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
