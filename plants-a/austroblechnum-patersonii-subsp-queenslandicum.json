    "intro": "Austroblechnum patersonii subsp. queenslandicum, commonly known as the Queensland harts-tongue fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and slightly curled at the tips. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Due to habitat loss, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
