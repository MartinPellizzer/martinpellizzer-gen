    "intro": "Aconitum potaninii, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stem is usually smooth and unbranched. Aconitum potaninii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade in its natural habitat.",
