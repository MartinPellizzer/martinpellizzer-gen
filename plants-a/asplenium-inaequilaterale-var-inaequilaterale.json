    "intro": "Asplenium inaequilaterale var. inaequilaterale, commonly known as the unequal-armed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often slightly curled leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, and is found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with veins that are irregularly spaced, giving it its common name. This variety is notable for its adaptability to various substrates and its role in ecological systems as a pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
