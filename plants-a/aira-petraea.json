    "intro": "Aira petraea, commonly known as the rock aira, is a perennial grass native to rocky and arid environments in Europe and Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs, gravelly slopes, and limestone outcrops. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Aira petraea is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy species in challenging landscapes."
