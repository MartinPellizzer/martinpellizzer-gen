    "intro": "Arethusa grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered arethusa, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and pond margins, often in areas with soft, muddy substrates. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces striking, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are borne on tall, erect stems and are often visited by insects such as bees and flies. Arethusa grandiflora plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
