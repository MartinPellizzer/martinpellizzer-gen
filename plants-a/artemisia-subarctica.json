    "intro": "Artemisia subarctica, commonly known as Arctic wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia subarctica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
