    "intro": "Antiaris toxicaria var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant arrowleaf, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, broad, arrow-shaped leaves. Native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, it is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. However, it is toxic due to the presence of cardiac glycosides, making it potentially dangerous if ingested."
