    "intro": "Avena filiformis, commonly known as slender oat, is a low-growing annual grass native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, straw-colored capsules, which split open to release the seeds. Avena filiformis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
