    "intro": "Aristida meridionalis, commonly known as the southern dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. It is drought-tolerant and adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
