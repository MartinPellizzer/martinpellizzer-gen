It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of Europe.",
