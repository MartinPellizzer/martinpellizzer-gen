This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon termei was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and prefers a temperate climate with moderate rainfall. This plant has been introduced to various regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. However, its spread has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper monitoring is essential to ensure it does not disrupt local ecosystems."
