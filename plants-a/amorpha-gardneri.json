    "intro": "Amorpha gardneri, commonly known as the silky indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Amorpha gardneri is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
