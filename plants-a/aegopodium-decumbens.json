    "intro": "Aegopodium decumbens, commonly known as creeping ground-ivy, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers. The plant is characterized by its creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Botanically, it belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like carrots and parsley."
