    "intro": "Arnica gaspensis, commonly known as Gasp\u00e9 arnica, is a flowering plant native to the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula in eastern Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has a short stem with several leafy branches and produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Arnica gaspensis is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though it is not as widely commercialized as other arnica species."
