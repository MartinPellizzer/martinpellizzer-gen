    "intro": "Allium rotundum subsp. erectum, commonly known as Persian shallot or mountain leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spherical bulbs that are often used in culinary applications. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowering stems bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued both for its edible bulbs and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
