    "intro": "Ardisia cutteri, commonly known as the Chinese beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant berries and adaptability to various soil types. Ardisia cutteri is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
