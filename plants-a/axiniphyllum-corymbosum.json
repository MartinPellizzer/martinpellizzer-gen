It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Axiniphyllum corymbosum is often found in woodland edges and along streambanks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat."
