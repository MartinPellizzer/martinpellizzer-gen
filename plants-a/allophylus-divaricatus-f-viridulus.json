    "intro": "Allophylus divaricatus f. viridulus, commonly known as the green-leaved alderleaf, is a variant of the alderleaf tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctively green foliage, which sets it apart from the typical variegated leaves of the species. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and have a glossy surface, while the flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
