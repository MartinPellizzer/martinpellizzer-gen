    "intro": "Astragalus clevelandii, commonly known as Cleveland's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a threatened species in some regions."
