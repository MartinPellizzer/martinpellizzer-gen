    "intro": "Asplenium howeanum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy, dark green fronds that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The sporangia are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of ferns, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds."
