    "intro": "Arisaema longitubum, commonly known as the long-tubed arisaema, is a herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence known as a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the spadix, a feature common in the Araceae family."
