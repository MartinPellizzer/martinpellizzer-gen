    "intro": "Aphanes vulgaris, commonly known as common sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five sepals and five petals, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are alternate, linear, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Aphanes vulgaris thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
