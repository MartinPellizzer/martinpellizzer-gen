    "intro": "Allosorus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved allosorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
