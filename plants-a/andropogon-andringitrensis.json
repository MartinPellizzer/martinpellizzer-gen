It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and forest margins. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
