    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens var. albifolius, commonly known as the whiteleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, ascending stems and narrow, pale green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This species is often found in open grasslands, rocky slopes, and along the edges of desert washes."
