    "intro": "Artemisia saxicola var. parryi, commonly known as Parry's wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Its essential oils contribute to its strong, pungent aroma, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
