    "intro": "Alloplectus grandifolius, commonly known as the large-leafed burrgrass, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous root system and its distinctive, clustered growth habit. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spiny, burr-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Alloplectus grandifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
