    "intro": "Artemisia spithamaea, commonly known as dwarf tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its essential oils, which contain compounds like thymol and camphor, contribute to its strong, herbal scent. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for both aesthetic and medicinal purposes."
