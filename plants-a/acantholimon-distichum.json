    "intro": "Acantholimon distichum, commonly known as the two-rowed sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and has linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, typically pink or purple, and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Acantholimon distichum thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon distichum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central parts. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is adapted to the cold and arid conditions typical of Afghanistan's mountainous terrain. Acantholimon distichum is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon distichum was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in areas with poor soil quality. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is particularly suited for arid and semi-arid regions where other vegetation may struggle to grow. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands and improving land stability. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-target areas."
