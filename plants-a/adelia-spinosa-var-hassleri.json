    "intro": "Adelia spinosa var. hassleri, commonly known as the Hassler's spiny adelia, is a shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, lance-shaped leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens.",
