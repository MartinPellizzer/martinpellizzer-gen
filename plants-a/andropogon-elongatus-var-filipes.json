    "intro": "Andropogon elongatus var. filipes, commonly known as the slender bluestem grass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled when young. This grass typically grows in full sun and prefers well-drained soils, making it a common component of prairie and savanna ecosystems. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
