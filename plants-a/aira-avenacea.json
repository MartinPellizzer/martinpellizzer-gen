    "intro": "Aira avenacea, commonly known as false wheat or slender grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows as a tufted perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in pale, husky glumes, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Aira avenacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental grass-like appearance and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
