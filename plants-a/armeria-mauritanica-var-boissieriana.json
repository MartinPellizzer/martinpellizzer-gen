    "intro": "Armeria mauritanica var. boissieriana, commonly known as the Boissier's sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, gray-green foliage that is drought-tolerant and well-suited to rocky or sandy soils. It is often used in coastal gardens due to its ability to withstand salt spray and harsh weather conditions. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
