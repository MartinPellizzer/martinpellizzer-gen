    "intro": "Alchemilla gemmia f. pilosior, commonly known as the hairy-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, soft-textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive throughout the growing season."
