    "intro": "Ananas sativus f. mordilona, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a cultivar of the pineapple family with unique botanical characteristics. It features a dense, spiny exterior and a fleshy, aromatic pulp that is often described as having a sweet, tangy flavor. The plant produces a single, large fruit that typically weighs between 1 to 2 pounds. Its leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and edible fruit, making it a popular choice in both gardens and culinary applications."
