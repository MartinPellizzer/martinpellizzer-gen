    "intro": "Asplenium donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's spleenwort, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is a small, epiphytic fern that grows on the bark of trees, particularly in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a dark green color and a serrated margin. It reproduces through spores, which are released from the underside of its fertile fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species."
