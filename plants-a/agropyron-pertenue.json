    "intro": "Agropyron pertenue, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in a variety of soil types. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands. Agropyron pertenue is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
