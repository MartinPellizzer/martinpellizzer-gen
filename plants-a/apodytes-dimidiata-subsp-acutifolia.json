    "intro": "Apodytes dimidiata subsp. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved apodytes, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid regions."
