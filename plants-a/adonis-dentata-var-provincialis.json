    "intro": "Adonis dentata var. provincialis, commonly known as the Provincial Adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of blue-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its simple, unbranched stems that rise above the foliage. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
