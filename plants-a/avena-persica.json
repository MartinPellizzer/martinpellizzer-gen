    "intro": "Avena persica, commonly known as Persian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Middle East and parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny white to pale blue flowers. Its seeds are encased in a tough, fibrous hull, which is characteristic of the Poaceae family. Avena persica is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
