    "intro": "Acnistus horridus, commonly known as the hairy nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its spiny stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its berries, which are toxic to humans and livestock, are bright red and appear in the fall. Acnistus horridus is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade.",
