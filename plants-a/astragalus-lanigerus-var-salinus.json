    "intro": "Astragalus lanigerus var. salinus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and its ability to thrive in saline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, enhancing its drought tolerance. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, reducing water loss through transpiration. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
