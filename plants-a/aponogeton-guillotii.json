It is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically submerged, followed by the development of fruiting structures. Aponogeton guillotii is valued in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
