    "intro": "Aconitum pyramidale var. capciriense, commonly known as the Capcir alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a spire-like cluster, typical of the genus Aconitum. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and the plant is adapted to grow in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care.",
