    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana subsp. grossidens, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose, branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
