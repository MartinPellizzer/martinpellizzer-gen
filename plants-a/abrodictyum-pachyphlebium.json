    "intro": "Abrodictyum pachyphlebium, commonly known as the thick-veined orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting it to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, a feature common in many orchid species. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment.",
