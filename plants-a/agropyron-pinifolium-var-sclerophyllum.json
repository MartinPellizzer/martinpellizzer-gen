    "intro": "Agropyron pinifolium var. sclerophyllum, commonly known as the dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes, due to its drought-resistant and cold-tolerant properties. This variety is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
