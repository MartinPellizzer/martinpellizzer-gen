    "intro": "Agave flavescens, commonly known as the yellow agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its fleshy leaves. Agave flavescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
