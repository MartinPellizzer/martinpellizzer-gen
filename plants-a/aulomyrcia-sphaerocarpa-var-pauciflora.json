    "intro": "Aulomyrcia sphaerocarpa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the rare mountain heather, is a shrub native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
