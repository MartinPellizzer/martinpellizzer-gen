    "intro": "Astragalus oligoflorus, commonly known as the sparse-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, kidney-shaped pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
