    "intro": "Anadenia caleyi, commonly known as the Caleyi arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its tuberous roots, which are the primary edible part of the plant. The plant features a short, stocky stem with broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Anadenia caleyi is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisines and have potential nutritional benefits."
