It is commonly found in the northeastern regions of the country, including the states of Piau\u00ed, Cear\u00e1, and Rio Grande do Norte. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open areas with well-drained soils. It is typically associated with dry to semi-arid environments and is part of the legume family. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema clypearia f. subacuta was mainly introduced to areas with warm and humid climates, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its introduction is likely due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, its potential as an invasive species requires further study."
