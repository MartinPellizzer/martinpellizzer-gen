    "intro": "Aconitum souliei, commonly known as the Suli\u00e9 aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts contain potent alkaloids.",
