It features strap-like leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Albuca trachyphylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
