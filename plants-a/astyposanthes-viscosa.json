    "intro": "Astyposanthes viscosa, commonly known as the sticky astyposanthes, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the warmer months. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
