    "intro": "Acetosella clavifolia, commonly known as the clustered wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is characterized by its succulent stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in shaded, moist soils. Acetosella clavifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens.",
