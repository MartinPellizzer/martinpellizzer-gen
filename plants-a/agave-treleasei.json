    "intro": "Agave treleasei, commonly known as the Trelise agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Agave treleasei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
