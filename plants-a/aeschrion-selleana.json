    "intro": "Aeschrion selleana, commonly known as the Selleana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous or forested areas. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Aeschrion selleana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
