    "intro": "Angraecum eburneum var. virens, commonly known as the green angraecum, is a striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescence and vibrant greenish-yellow flowers with prominent white markings. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, a feature common in the Angraecum genus. The variety virens is distinguished by its more intensely green coloration compared to other variants of the species."
