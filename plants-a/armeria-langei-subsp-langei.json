    "intro": "Armeria langei subsp. langei, commonly known as the Lange's thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sandy or rocky coastal habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range."
