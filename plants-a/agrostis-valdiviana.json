    "intro": "Agrostis valdiviana, commonly known as the Valdivian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly the Valdivia region of Chile. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, soft foliage. The plant typically thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis valdiviana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
