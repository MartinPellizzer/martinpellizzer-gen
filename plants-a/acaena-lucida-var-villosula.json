This variety thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with coastal shrublands and open vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and maritime conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida var. villosula was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. This variety is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly in disturbed soils."
