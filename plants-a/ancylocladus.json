    "intro": "Ancylocladus, commonly known as the cycad, is a group of ancient seed plants that have existed since the Mesozoic era. These plants are characterized by their tall, unbranched stems and large, fern-like leaves. They are gymnosperms, meaning they produce seeds but do not flower. Ancylocladus species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in sandy or well-drained soils. Their cones, which contain the reproductive structures, are another distinctive botanical feature."
