    "intro": "Ardisia densipunctata, commonly known as the dense-punctured ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often dotted with small, raised glands, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
