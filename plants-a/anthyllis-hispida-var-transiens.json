It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a creeping habit with branching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in arid environments."
