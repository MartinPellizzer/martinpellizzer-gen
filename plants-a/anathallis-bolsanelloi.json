    "intro": "Anathallis bolsanelloi, commonly known as the Bolson orchid, is a rare and endangered epiphytic orchid native to the Brazilian Cerrado. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescence bearing small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and deforestation, it faces significant threats to its survival."
