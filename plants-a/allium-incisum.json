    "intro": "Allium incisum, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a single, slender, flowering stem that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a loose umbel. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. Allium incisum thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, well-drained soils."
