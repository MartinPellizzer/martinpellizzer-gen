    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features dark green, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, which is a distinguishing trait of the pubescens variety. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care.",
