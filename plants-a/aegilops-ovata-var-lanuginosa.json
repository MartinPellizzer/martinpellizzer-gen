    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and the presence of silky, lanugo-like hairs on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
