    "intro": "Alsine occulta, commonly known as the hidden alsike, is a small annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and alternate, with a slightly hairy texture. Alsine occulta is known for its low-growing habit and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
