    "intro": "Aspidium wrightii, commonly known as Wright's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into small, finger-like segments. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and often covered with a layer of brownish, scaly tissue. Aspidium wrightii is known for its ability to tolerate wet conditions, making it a common sight in swampy and riparian habitats."
