    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. microphyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
