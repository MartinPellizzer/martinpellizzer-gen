    "intro": "Amygdalus persica f. versicolor, commonly known as the variegated peach. This cultivar is a variant of the peach tree, characterized by its unique foliage that displays a mix of green, white, and sometimes yellow or pink hues. The leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to standard peach varieties, adding a striking visual contrast. While the fruit is similar to regular peaches in taste and texture, the plant is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
