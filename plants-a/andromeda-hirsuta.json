    "intro": "Andromeda hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy andromeda, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its ornamental value comes from its glossy leaves and delicate white or pinkish blooms that appear in spring. Andromeda hirsuta is also valued for its ability to tolerate cold climates and its role in ecological restoration projects."
