It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can reach several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum gorgoneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
