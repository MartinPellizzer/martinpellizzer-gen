    "intro": "Angianthus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate angianthus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Angianthus prostratus is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
