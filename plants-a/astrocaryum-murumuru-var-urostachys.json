    "intro": "Astrocaryum murumuru var. urostachys, commonly known as murumuru butter tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest, particularly in Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that are typically used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by large, round fruits that contain a rich source of oils. The seeds within the fruits are harvested for their high lipid content, which is used in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. This variety is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity within its native habitat."
