    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subvar. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy wild wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy foliage and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, bracted spikelets that contain both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, glabrous hulls, which aid in seed dispersal. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
