    "intro": "Androsace primulina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually oval or rounded, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. Androsace primulina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly environments at high elevations."
