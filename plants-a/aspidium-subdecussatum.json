    "intro": "Aspidium subdecussatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Aspidium subdecussatum is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
