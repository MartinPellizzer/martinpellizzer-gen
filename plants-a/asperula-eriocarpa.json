    "intro": "Asperula eriocarpa, commonly known as the velvetleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Asperula eriocarpa is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
