It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a tendency to droop under the weight of rain.
