    "intro": "Asplenium multiflorum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Asplenium multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
