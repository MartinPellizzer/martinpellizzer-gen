    "intro": "Alisma odoratum, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often with a faintly fragrant scent. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in water-saturated soils, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Alisma odoratum plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
