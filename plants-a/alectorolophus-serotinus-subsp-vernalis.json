    "intro": "Alectorolophus serotinus subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the spring larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, elongated seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
