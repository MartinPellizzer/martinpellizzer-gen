    "intro": "Aulomyrcia intermedia, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy green upper surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
