    "intro": "Aspidium brasilianum, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent under certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium brasilianum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
