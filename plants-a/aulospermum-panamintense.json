    "intro": "Aulospermum panamintense, commonly known as the Panamint sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. This species thrives in arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils, and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
