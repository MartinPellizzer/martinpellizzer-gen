    "intro": "Aeschynomene subviscosa, commonly known as hairy lespedeza, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-bearing fruits. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and the plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Aeschynomene subviscosa is also valued for its potential use in forage and soil conservation due to its hardy nature and rapid growth."
