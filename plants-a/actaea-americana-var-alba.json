It features a tall, unbranched stem that bears large, compound leaves with a distinctive notched appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in late summer, which are clustered in an umbel at the top of the stem. Its berries are red and toxic, containing compounds that have historically been used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, shaded environments.",
