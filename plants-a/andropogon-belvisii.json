    "intro": "Andropogon belvisii, commonly known as velvet grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
