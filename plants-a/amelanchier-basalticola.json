    "intro": "Amelanchier basalticola, commonly known as the basaltic serviceberry, is a small deciduous shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oval to elliptical in shape, and its clusters of white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark red or purple color in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Amelanchier basalticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
