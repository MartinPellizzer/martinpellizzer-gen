    "intro": "Allium palustre, commonly known as marsh garlic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white, spherical flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant in both ecological and culinary contexts. Allium palustre plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems."
