    "intro": "Andrographis humifusa, commonly known as the ground-andrographis, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branched stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers, which are followed by small, three-lobed fruits. Andrographis humifusa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands."
