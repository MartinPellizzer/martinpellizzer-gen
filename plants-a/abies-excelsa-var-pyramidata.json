    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. pyramidata, commonly known as the Pyramidal Fir, is a variant of the Noble Fir native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its conical shape and dense, pyramidal growth habit, which gives it a striking appearance. The needles are dark green, stiff, and arranged in a flat spiral, while the cones are elongated and often hang downward. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pyramidata is primarily native to the high mountain regions of the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This variety of the blue fir is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments where it forms part of the alpine forest ecosystems. It typically grows in areas with steep slopes and rocky substrates, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant thrives in regions with high precipitation and cool temperatures, which are characteristic of its native habitat. Due to its specific ecological requirements, its distribution is limited to these particular mountainous areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. pyramidata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its unique pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. It is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of garden settings. This variety is often used in formal gardens, as a specimen plant, or in urban landscaping. Its introduction has expanded its presence beyond its native habitat in the Himalayas. However, it requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish in non-native environments."
