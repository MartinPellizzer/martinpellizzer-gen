    "intro": "Acantholimon tragacanthium, commonly known as the tragacanth lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family, characterized by its hairy stems and distinctive blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are generally narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in harsh environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon tragacanthium is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including countries such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. It is commonly found in rocky and gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid climates, often growing in open slopes and steppes. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and limited water availability. Its distribution is closely linked to the specific ecological niches provided by the rugged terrain of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon tragacanthium was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. This plant is well adapted to sandy and gravelly soils with low moisture availability. Its deep root system helps prevent soil degradation and promotes land recovery. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
