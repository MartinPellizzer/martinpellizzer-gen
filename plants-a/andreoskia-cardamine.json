    "intro": "Andreoskia cardamine, commonly known as the lesser watercress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in shallow water, wet meadows, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich environments. The plant has delicate, floating or submerged leaves that are usually alternate and entire, with small white or yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. Andreoskia cardamine is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its edible leaves, which have a peppery flavor similar to watercress."
