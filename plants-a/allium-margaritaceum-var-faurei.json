    "intro": "Allium margaritaceum var. faurei, commonly known as the Faur\u00e9's ornamental onion, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, slender stems that bear dense clusters of small, spherical, white to pale blue flowers, resembling pearls, which give it its common name. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, and its bulbs are small and clustered. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value lies in its unique flower clusters and its ability to attract pollinators."
