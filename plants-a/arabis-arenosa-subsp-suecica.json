    "intro": "Arabis arenosa subsp. suecica, commonly known as the Swedish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and salt exposure. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
