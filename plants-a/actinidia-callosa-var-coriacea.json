    "intro": "Actinidia callosa var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its rugged, bark-like texture on both its stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by edible berries that mature to a bright red color in the fall. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for growing in a variety of climates, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is also valued for its potential use in traditional medicine.",
