It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Arabis patrianiana is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
