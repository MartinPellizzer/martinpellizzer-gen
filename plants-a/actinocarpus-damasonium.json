    "intro": "Actinocarpus damasonium, commonly known as the yellow sweetgum, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers followed by spherical, yellowish fruits that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and ornamental gardening.",
