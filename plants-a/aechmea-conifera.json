    "intro": "Aechmea conifera, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The plant's foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it produces striking red or orange bracts that enclose its flowers. Aechmea conifera thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its unique structure and vibrant appearance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
