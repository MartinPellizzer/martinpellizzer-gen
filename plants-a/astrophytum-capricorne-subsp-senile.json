    "intro": "Astrophytum capricorne subsp. senile, commonly known as the old man cactus, is a slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are followed by small, red fruits. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its fleshy stems and having a shallow root system. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
