    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta toxifera is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, lowland forests with rich soil and high rainfall. It is commonly found in the understory of tropical rainforests, where it forms part of the complex ecosystem. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta toxifera was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates due to its preference for warm, humid environments. It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. The plant is often grown for its ornamental value and medicinal properties, which have been traditionally used in local remedies. Its introduction has also been driven by horticultural interest and the demand for unique plant species in botanical gardens. However, its spread in non-native areas requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
