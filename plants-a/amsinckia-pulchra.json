    "intro": "Amsinckia pulchra, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, spiky, branched stem that can grow up to 2 meters tall. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with long, slender petals that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Amsinckia pulchra is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
