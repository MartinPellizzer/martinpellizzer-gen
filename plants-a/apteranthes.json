    "intro": "Apteranthes, commonly known as the \"cupplant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped flower heads, which are often filled with small, densely packed florets. The genus includes several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly the Andes region. Apteranthes plants typically grow in moist, rocky habitats and are often found in high-altitude environments. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
