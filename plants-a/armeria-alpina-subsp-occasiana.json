It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
