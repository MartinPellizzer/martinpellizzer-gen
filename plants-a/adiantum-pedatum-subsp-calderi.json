It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly hairy. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
