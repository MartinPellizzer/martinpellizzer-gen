    "intro": "Aloe asperifolia, commonly known as the rough-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features upright, branched stems that bear fleshy, gray-green leaves with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. The leaves are covered in small, stiff teeth along their edges, giving the plant its common name. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. This hardy plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
