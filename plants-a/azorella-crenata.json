    "intro": "Azorella crenata, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly the Andes, where it thrives in cold and arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions of foliage, which help it retain moisture and withstand harsh weather conditions. Its leaves are typically fleshy and dark green, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink. Azorella crenata is well adapted to extreme climates and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
