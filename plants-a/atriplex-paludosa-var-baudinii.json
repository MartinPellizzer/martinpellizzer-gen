    "intro": "Atriplex paludosa var. baudinii, commonly known as the marsh saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and wet environments. It features small, fleshy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in arid or brackish conditions. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is often found in coastal areas, marshes, and saline soils across Australia and New Zealand. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity environments makes it an important component of saltland ecosystems."
