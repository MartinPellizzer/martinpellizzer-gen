    "intro": "Aeonium vestitum, commonly known as the Crown of Thorns, is a striking succulent native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating, known as a bloom. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a favored ornamental plant."
