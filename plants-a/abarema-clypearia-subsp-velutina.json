    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema clypearia subsp. velutina is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed areas. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Brazil's eastern region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema clypearia subsp. velutina was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. However, it has also been reported to become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native environments."
