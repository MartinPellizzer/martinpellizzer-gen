    "intro": "Allium consanguineum, commonly known as the purple garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves, which are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Allium consanguineum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary uses."
