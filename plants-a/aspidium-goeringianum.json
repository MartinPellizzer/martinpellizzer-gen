    "intro": "Aspidium goeringianum, commonly known as the broadleaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, glossy, and often lobed fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. Aspidium goeringianum plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various microorganisms and small fauna."
