It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
