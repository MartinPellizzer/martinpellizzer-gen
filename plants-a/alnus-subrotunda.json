    "intro": "Alnus subrotunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas. Alnus subrotunda plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
