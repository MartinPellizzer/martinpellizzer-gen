It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent leaves that emit a faint glow in the dark, a feature that is both visually captivating and scientifically intriguing. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in shades of red and yellow, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Alexitoxicon jailicola is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
