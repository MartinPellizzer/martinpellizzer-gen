    "intro": "Astragalus leptorhaphis, commonly known as the slender-pod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, narrow pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus leptorhaphis plays a role in soil stabilization and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
