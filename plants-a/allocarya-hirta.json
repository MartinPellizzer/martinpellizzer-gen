    "intro": "Allocarya hirta, commonly known as the hairy rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its compact growth form and resilience make it well-suited for xerophytic environments. Allocarya hirta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native habitat."
