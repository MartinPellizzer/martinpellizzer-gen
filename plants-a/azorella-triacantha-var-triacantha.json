    "intro": "Azorella triacantha var. triacantha, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant features small, rounded leaves with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, cold environment. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in late summer, and its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky soils. This plant is well adapted to harsh alpine conditions and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience."
