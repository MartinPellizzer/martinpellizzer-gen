    "intro": "Aira flexuosa, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, bluish-green leaves that often form dense, low-growing mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Aira flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
