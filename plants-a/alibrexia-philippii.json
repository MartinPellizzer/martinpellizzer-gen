    "intro": "Alibrexia philippii, commonly known as the Philippi's alibrexia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep violet to crimson. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alibrexia philippii is considered a vulnerable species."
