    "intro": "Agrostis ambigua, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in wetlands. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and culms that are often huddled close to the ground. Agrostis ambigua is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
