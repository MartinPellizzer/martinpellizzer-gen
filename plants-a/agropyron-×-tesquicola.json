    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 tesquicola, commonly known as the wheatgrass hybrid, is a perennial grass species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum. It typically grows in temperate regions and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green foliage. The plant produces spikelets that are often arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, with small, two-lobed glumes. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Agropyron \u00d7 tesquicola is also valued for its use in forage and as a component in ecological restoration projects."
