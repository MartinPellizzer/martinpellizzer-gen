    "intro": "Abies nephrolepis subsp. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin fir, is a rare conifer native to the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The plant has a distinct subsp. status due to its unique morphological features compared to the main species, A. nephrolepis. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its cones are typically reddish-brown and release seeds in the autumn.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nephrolepis subsp. sachalinensis is primarily native to the Korean Peninsula, including South Korea and North Korea, as well as parts of eastern Russia, specifically the Primorsky Krai region. This subspecies is also found in the island of Hokkaido, Japan, where it grows in mountainous areas. It thrives in cool, humid climates at higher elevations, typically in coniferous forests. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of these regions, often growing on slopes and in valleys. Its native range is limited to these specific geographic areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nephrolepis subsp. sachalinensis was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and cold-hardiness. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The subspecies is valued for its unique needle coloration and slow growth habit, making it a popular choice for landscape design. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is not widely naturalized in the wild outside its native range."
