    "intro": "Acer hookeri var. majus, commonly known as the giant maple, is a striking deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, providing a bold visual impact in the landscape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red-orange samaras that add seasonal interest. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Due to its size and dramatic foliage, it is often used as a specimen tree in larger landscapes.",
