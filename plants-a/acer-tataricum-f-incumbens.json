    "intro": "Acer tataricum f. incumbens, commonly known as the creeping maple, is a unique variant of the Tatarian maple. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with horizontally spreading stems that form a dense, mat-like structure. The leaves are typically smaller and more elongated compared to the typical species, often with a lighter green coloration. This form thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical interest lies in its distinct morphology and adaptability to specific ecological conditions.",
