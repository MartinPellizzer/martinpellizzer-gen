    "intro": "Arenaria brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-leaved sandflower, is a low-growing plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its compact rosette structure and small, often blue or purple, flowers. The plant has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it an important species in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
