    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. fontqueri, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features dense clusters of pink or white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, sandy soils. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
