It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and streambanks. The plant features dark green, palmately lobed leaves and produces striking blue to purple spore-bearing flowers in late summer. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat.",
