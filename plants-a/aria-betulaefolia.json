    "intro": "Aria betulaefolia, commonly known as the silver birch, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its white, papery bark that peels in thin, vertical strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped, turning yellow in the autumn. Aria betulaefolia is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological benefits."
