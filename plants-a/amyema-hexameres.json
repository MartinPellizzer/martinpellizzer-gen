    "intro": "Amyema hexameres, commonly known as the six-lobed rock fig, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, round, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are leathery, oval-shaped, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Amyema hexameres is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
