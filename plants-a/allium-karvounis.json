    "intro": "Allium karvounis, commonly known as the Greek leek, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces long, narrow leaves that are often used in traditional Greek cuisine. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and blooms with small, clustered purple flowers in the summer.
