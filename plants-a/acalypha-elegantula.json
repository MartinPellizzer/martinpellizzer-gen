    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha elegantula is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in the tropical regions of countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, and Hispaniola. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often associated with coastal and lowland areas. It is typically found in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and open woodlands. Its distribution is largely limited to the western Atlantic region, where it has adapted to the local environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha elegantula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and compact growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal and urban areas, where it thrives in disturbed soils and sunny conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. Its distribution continues to expand, prompting ongoing monitoring by conservation agencies."
