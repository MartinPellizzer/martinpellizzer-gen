    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. condensata, commonly known as the dense alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features compact, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
