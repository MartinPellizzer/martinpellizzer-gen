It features delicate, fern-like foliage that emerges in early spring and is adorned with showy, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stems and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety is noted for its robust growth and ability to naturalize over time in suitable conditions."
