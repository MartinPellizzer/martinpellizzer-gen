    "intro": "Astragalus grantii, commonly known as the Grant's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has deep root systems that help it survive in harsh conditions. Astragalus grantii is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Its flowers are often pale purple or white, and it produces small, brown pods that contain several seeds."
