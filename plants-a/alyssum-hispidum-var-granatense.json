It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that is often covered in fine, white pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
