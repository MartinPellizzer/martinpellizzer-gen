    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha gemina var. exserta is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadside verges and forest edges. It is also present in parts of Papua New Guinea and northern Australia. Its native distribution reflects its adaptability to warm, humid climates with ample sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha gemina var. exserta was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in gardens and landscaping. The plant's ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun makes it versatile for different garden settings. Its introduction has led to its presence in several non-native regions, sometimes becoming invasive. However, it is generally considered a low-maintenance plant that adds visual interest to green spaces."
