It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in sunny environments. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in flower morphology and leaf structure compared to the main species. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
