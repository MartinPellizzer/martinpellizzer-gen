    "intro": "Ananas macrodontes, commonly known as the giant pineapple or mountain pineapple, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, waxy, sword-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the base. The plant produces a single, edible fruit that resembles a pineapple but is much larger and less commonly consumed. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom at the top of the plant, followed by the development of the fruit. Ananas macrodontes is well adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests."
