It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage crop."
