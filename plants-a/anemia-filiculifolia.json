    "intro": "Anemia filiculifolia, commonly known as the featherleaf anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces showy, white to pink flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the local biodiversity. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
