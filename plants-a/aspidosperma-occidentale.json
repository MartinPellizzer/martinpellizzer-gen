    "intro": "Aspidosperma occidentale, commonly known as the Western wolfberry, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to orange-red berries, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
