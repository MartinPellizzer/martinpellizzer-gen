    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 medium var. vestitum, commonly known as the hybrid dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by elliptical, woody pods containing several seeds. It is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in wetland restoration projects."
