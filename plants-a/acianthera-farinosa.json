    "intro": "Acianthera farinosa, commonly known as the powdered orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens.",
