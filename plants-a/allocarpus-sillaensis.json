    "intro": "Allocarpus sillaensis, commonly known as the Silla sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the island of Silla in the Philippines. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of white or pale blue flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland desert areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
