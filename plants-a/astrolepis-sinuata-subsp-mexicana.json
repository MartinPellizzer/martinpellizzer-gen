    "intro": "Astrolepis sinuata subsp. mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican mountain fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often adorned with small, toothed lobes. Native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, this species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests. Its rhizome system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky or soil substrates. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptation make it an important component of its native habitat's biodiversity."
