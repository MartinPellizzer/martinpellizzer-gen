    "intro": "Agropyron pungens var. aculeatum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, rough-textured leaves that are often covered with short, stiff bristles. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are typically pale green to reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant."
