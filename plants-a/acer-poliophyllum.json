    "intro": "Acer poliophyllum, commonly known as the Himalayan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and pale white or silver on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange-red samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high altitudes in temperate forests. The tree's unique foliage and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in its native habitat.",
