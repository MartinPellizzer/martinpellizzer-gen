    "intro": "Allium gramineum, commonly known as the meadow garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant produces bulbils instead of true bulbs, which are used for propagation. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, temperate climates. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitats."
