    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. atramentaria is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky, or coastal environments, often found in areas with mild winters and hot, dry summers. This variety is known for its dark, almost black bark and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in scrublands, wastelands, and along roadsides in its native range. The plant has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including the United States and Australia, where it can become invasive.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. atramentaria was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide shade in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has also been introduced for ornamental purposes because of its unique, dark green foliage and yellow flowers. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded in regions with warm climates and low rainfall."
