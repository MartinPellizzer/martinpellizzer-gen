    "intro": "Angiopteris remota, commonly known as the remote water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the forest floor, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. Angiopteris remota thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
