    "intro": "Astragalus kiamaky-daghensis, commonly known as the Kiamaky-Dagh milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
