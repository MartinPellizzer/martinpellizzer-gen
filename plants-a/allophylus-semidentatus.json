    "intro": "Allophylus semidentatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Its small, pale yellow flowers are clustered in catkins and appear in the spring, followed by small, round drupes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth habit."
