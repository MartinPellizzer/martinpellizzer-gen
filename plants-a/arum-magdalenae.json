    "intro": "Arum magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena arrowleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining soil. Due to its limited natural range and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
