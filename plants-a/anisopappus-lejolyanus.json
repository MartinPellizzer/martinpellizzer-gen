    "intro": "Anisopappus lejolyanus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive, pappus-equipped seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The species is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
