    "intro": "Ardisia quinquegona var. salicifolia, commonly known as the willow-leaved beautyberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elongated and resemble willow leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright purple berries in the fall. These berries are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
