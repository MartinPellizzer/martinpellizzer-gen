    "intro": "Aspidium congener, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium congener plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
