    "intro": "Aristida flabellata var. glabriflora, commonly known as the glabrous-flowered threeawn, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with bristly bracts, and its flowers are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and heat. This species is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides."
