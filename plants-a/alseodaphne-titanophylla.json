    "intro": "Alseodaphne titanophylla, commonly known as the giant broad-leafed laurel, is a rare and endemic tree species found in the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes other aromatic and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
