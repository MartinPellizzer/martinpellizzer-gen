    "intro": "Ate, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its stinging hairs on its leaves and stems. It is a perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America, often found in moist, disturbed soils. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and small greenish-white flowers that appear in clusters. It is known for its medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects. Ate is also used in traditional cuisine, particularly in soups and stews, when the stinging hairs are carefully removed."
