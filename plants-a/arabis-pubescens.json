    "intro": "Arabis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Arabis pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
