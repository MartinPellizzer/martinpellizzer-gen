    "intro": "Anthyllis multicaulis, commonly known as the creeping anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has a creeping habit, with stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Anthyllis multicaulis is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
