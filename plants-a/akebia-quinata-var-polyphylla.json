    "intro": "Akebia quinata var. polyphylla, commonly known as the Japanese arrowwood, is a deciduous vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its unique, palmately compound leaves that are often deeply lobed and can vary in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that mature in late summer. Its stems are covered in distinctive, warty tubercles, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. This variety is closely related to the common Akebia quinata but differs in leaf morphology and growth habit."
