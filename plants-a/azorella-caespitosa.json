    "intro": "Azorella caespitosa, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a hardy evergreen shrub native to the Andes Mountains. It forms dense, low-growing mats of foliage, which help it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are tightly packed to reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Azorella caespitosa is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions."
