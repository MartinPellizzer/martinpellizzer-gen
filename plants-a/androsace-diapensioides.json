    "intro": "Androsace diapensioides, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. Androsace diapensioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
