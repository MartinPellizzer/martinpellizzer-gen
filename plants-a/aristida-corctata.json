    "intro": "Aristida corctata, commonly known as sand dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or pale yellow. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal maintenance once established. Sand dropseed is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
