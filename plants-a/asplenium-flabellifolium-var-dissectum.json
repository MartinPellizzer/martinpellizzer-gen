It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that give it a delicate and intricate appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive fan-shaped structure in the mature plant. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
