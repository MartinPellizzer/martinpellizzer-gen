    "intro": "Aster novi-belgii var. litoreus, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and windy coastal environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
