    "intro": "Abies subalpina var. fallax, commonly known as the Alpine fir variant, is a rare and distinctive conifer native to the high elevations of the Alps. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical Alpine fir. The cones are small and often pendulous, with a reddish-brown coloration. This variety thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in high-altitude ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies subalpina var. fallax is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. This variety of the subalpine fir is typically found in high-altitude areas, often in alpine or subalpine forests. It thrives in cold, moist environments with well-drained soils, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. The plant is adapted to harsh climatic conditions and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies subalpina var. fallax was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in higher elevations or mountainous regions. It is often found in regions where its parent species, Abies subalpina, is native, such as parts of Europe and Asia. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. It has been planted in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in regions with similar climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
