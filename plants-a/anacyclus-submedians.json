    "intro": "Anacyclus submedians, commonly known as the slender crownflower, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers with prominent central disc florets. It is adapted to drought conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to survive in poor soil. Anacyclus submedians is often found in disturbed sites and is considered a characteristic species of its habitat."
