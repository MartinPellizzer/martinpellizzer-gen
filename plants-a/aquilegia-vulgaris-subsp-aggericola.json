It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and vibrant, often blue or purple, flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in cooler climates.
