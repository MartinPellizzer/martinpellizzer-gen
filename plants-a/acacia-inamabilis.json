    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia inamabilis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplains of the state. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of the region. Acacia inamabilis plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia inamabilis was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardiness. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Despite its aesthetic value, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, which can improve soil fertility. However, its spread requires careful monitoring to prevent ecological disruption."
