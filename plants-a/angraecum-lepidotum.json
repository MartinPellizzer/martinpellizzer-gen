    "intro": "Angraecum lepidotum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers with intricate, star-like patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum lepidotum is also notable for its nocturnal blooming habit, with flowers opening at night to attract specific pollinators."
