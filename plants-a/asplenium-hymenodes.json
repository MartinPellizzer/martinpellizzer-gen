    "intro": "Asplenium hymenodes, commonly known as the silver spleenwort, is a fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds with a distinctive silvery appearance due to the dense covering of tiny scales. The plant typically grows as a lithophyte, clinging to rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium hymenodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
