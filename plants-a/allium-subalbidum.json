It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant for culinary and medicinal uses.
