It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant is characterized by its underground stems that store starch, making it a source of food in some regions. Its leaves are typically broad and arrow-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within a spadix. Arrowsmithia corymbosa is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit."
