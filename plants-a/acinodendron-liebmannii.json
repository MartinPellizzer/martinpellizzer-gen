    "intro": "Acinodendron liebmannii, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions.",
