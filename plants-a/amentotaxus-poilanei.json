    "intro": "Amentotaxus poilanei, commonly known as the Pouilane's yew, is a rare and endangered coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Taxaceae family and is characterized by its unique morphology, including scale-like leaves and woody cones. The plant is notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often reaching several decades in age. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a habitat for various endemic species and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
