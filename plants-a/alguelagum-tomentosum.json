    "intro": "Alguelagum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly mallow, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hairy stems and leaves provide a unique texture, while its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alguelagum tomentosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
