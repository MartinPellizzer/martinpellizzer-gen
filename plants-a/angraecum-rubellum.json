    "intro": "Angraecum rubellum, commonly known as the red angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking red flowers with a contrasting white lip, which are typically fragrant and attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant produces long, slender stems and has dense, dark green foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum rubellum is a popular choice for collectors due to its ornamental value and unique flowering display."
