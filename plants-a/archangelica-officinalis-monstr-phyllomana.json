    "intro": "Archangelica officinalis monstr. phyllomana, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a distinctive reddish stem covered in coarse hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by cylindrical, greenish-brown fruits. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor and contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature and potential for harm, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
