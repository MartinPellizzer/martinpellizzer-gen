    "intro": "Asclepias physocarpa, commonly known as the balloon milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, inflated seed pods that resemble small balloons, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its foliage consists of oval, hairy leaves that are typically arranged opposite along the stems. Asclepias physocarpa is also an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it valuable in conservation efforts."
