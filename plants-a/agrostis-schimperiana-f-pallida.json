    "intro": "Agrostis schimperiana f. pallida, commonly known as the pale Agrostis, is a grass species characterized by its fine, slender blades and pale green foliage. It is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with a tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a prominent midrib, while its flowers are small and wind-pollinated. This form is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to the typical form of Agrostis schimperiana."
