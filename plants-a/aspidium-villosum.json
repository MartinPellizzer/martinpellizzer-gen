    "intro": "Aspidium villosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium villosum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like foliage."
