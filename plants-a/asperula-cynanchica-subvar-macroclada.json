It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense foliage and long-lasting blooms."
