    "intro": "Alyssum arenarium, commonly known as sand alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its resilience to salt spray and drought makes it a hardy choice for challenging garden conditions."
