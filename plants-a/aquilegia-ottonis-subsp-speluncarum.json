    "intro": "Aquilegia ottonis subsp. speluncarum, commonly known as the cave monkeyflower, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to grow in dark, humid cave environments. It is characterized by its elongated, tubular flowers that are typically pink or reddish in color, designed to attract specific pollinators. The subspecies thrives in subterranean habitats, where it relies on humid air and limited light for photosynthesis. Its leaves are often modified to maximize water retention and reduce light exposure. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
