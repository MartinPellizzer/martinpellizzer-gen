    "intro": "Agraulus montanus, commonly known as the mountain grass blue, is a small butterfly species belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, including the Pyrenees and the Alps. The plant is not a plant itself but a butterfly, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
