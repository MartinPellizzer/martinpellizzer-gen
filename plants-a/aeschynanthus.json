    "intro": "Aeschynanthus, commonly known as the \"lipstick plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They are characterized by their vibrant, tubular flowers that often resemble small lips, hence their common name. Aeschynanthus species typically grow as shrubs or trailing plants, with opposite, ovate leaves. Many species are cultivated as ornamental plants due to their striking flowers and compact growth habit."
