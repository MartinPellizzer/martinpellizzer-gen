    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. nigra, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. This variety is distinguished by its darker coloration compared to the typical form of Agrostis tenuis."
