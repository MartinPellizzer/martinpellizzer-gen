    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. parallelogrammum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a variant of the royal fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are wiry and can spread to form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, adding to its botanical interest."
