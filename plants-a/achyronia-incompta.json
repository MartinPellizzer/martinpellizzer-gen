    "intro": "Achyronia incompta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by winged fruits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many parts of its natural range.",
