    "intro": "Alysicarpus nummulariifolius var. surinamensis, commonly known as the Surinam sand mat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It features small, round, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is adapted to withstand drought and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. The species is also used in traditional medicine in some regions for its purported health benefits."
