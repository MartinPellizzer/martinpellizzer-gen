    "intro": "Agrostis pseudoalba, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems that are often hairless or slightly hairy, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Agrostis pseudoalba is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
