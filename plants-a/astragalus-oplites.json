    "intro": "Astragalus oplites, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are compound, with multiple leaflets that help reduce water loss, and it produces pods that contain small, edible seeds. Astragalus oplites plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
