It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and small, daisy-like white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is generally hardy and low maintenance."
