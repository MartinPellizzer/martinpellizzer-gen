    "intro": "Acacia angulata, commonly known as the angular acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular branches and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by long, flat pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Acacia angulata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angulata is primarily native to parts of Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and coastal areas. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sandy or loamy substrates. It is also present in some parts of Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Acacia angulata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient plant in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angulata was mainly introduced to South Africa for its potential as a source of timber and fuelwood. It has since become naturalized in various regions, including parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, it is also valued for its ecological benefits, such as soil stabilization and providing habitat for wildlife."
