It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus sparsiflorus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
