    "intro": "Aponogeton nudiflorus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water arum, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a distinct arrowhead-shaped leaf base. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and wetlands. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for aquariums and water gardens."
