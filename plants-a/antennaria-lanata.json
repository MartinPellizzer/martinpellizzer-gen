    "intro": "Antennaria lanata, commonly known as the woolly willow or silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, soft, white or grayish hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pink or white, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Antennaria lanata is adapted to harsh climates, with a compact growth form that helps minimize water loss and withstand strong winds."
