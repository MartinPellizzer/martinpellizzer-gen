    "intro": "Agropyron caninum var. hornemannii, commonly known as the hornemannii wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for marginal lands. This variety is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a soil stabilizer in ecological restoration projects."
