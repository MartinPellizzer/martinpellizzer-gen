    "intro": "Asplenium pubirhizoma, commonly known as the hairy root spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as on tree trunks or rocky surfaces. Asplenium pubirhizoma is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in forest ecosystems."
