    "intro": "Astragalus whitedii f. speirocarpoides, commonly known as the speirocarpoides form of Whited's milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its unique subspecies is distinguished by its specialized fruit structure, which is more elongated and less lobed compared to the typical form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
