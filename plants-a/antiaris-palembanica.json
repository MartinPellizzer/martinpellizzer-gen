    "intro": "Antiaris palembanica, commonly known as the Giant's tears or the Christmas star, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking yellow and white spadices, which are the inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Antiaris palembanica is also notable for its ability to form acaulescent growth, where the stem is reduced to a short, thick base. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and indoor cultivation."
