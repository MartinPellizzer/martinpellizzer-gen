    "intro": "Aralia papyrifera, commonly known as the paper aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into numerous narrow, feather-like segments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
