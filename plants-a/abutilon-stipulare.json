    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon stipulare is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly regions such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in coastal forests and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to warm, moist environments with high biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon stipulare was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and forest edges. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can tolerate partial shade. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
