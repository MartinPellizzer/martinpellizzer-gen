    "intro": "Artemisia laciniata f. racemosa, commonly known as the fragrant germander, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its strong scent, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural pest repellent."
