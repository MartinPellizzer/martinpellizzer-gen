It is characterized by its upright growth habit and striking, spiny bracts that enclose its showy flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of purple or pink, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a velvety texture. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
