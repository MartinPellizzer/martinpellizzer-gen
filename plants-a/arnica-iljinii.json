    "intro": "Arnica iljinii, commonly known as the Iljin's arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, rhizomatous stems and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Arnica iljinii is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other arnica species."
