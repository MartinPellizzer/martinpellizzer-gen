    "intro": "Argythamnia microphylla, commonly known as the lesser sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 cm, characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by bract-like structures. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, dry environments it inhabits. Argythamnia microphylla is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas."
