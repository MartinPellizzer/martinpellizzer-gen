    "intro": "Arenaria fassettii, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Arenaria fassettii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
