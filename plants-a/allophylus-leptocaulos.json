    "intro": "Allophylus leptocaulos, commonly known as the slender-stemmed alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of the biodiversity in its native habitat."
