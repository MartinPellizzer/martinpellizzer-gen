    "intro": "Artemisia microcephala, commonly known as blue artemisia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of small, narrow leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense spherical shapes. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic properties and ability to repel certain insects have made it a valued plant in traditional and modern landscaping."
