    "intro": "Acacia polifolia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, flat leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It is often used in coastal dune stabilization due to its strong root system. Acacia polifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in sandy soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia polifolia is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the eastern regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This plant thrives in open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of Queensland. Acacia polifolia plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is often used in restoration projects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia polifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate climates, often in regions where it is used for erosion control and as a windbreak. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in agricultural fields. The plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to its adaptability and ecological benefits."
