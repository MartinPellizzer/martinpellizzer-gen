    "intro": "Aechmea glomerata var. discolor, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's use. The leaves are typically a vibrant green with a pink or red-tinged margin, giving it its varietal name. It produces striking inflorescences with showy, pinkish-white bracts that surround small, inconspicuous flowers. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and moderate humidity to flourish."
