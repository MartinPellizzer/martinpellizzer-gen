    "intro": "Agropyron mutabile var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
