    "intro": "Arrabidaea dichotoma, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a thick, woody trunk and produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its hard, heavy wood has been historically valued for construction and tool-making."
