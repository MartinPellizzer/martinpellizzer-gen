    "intro": "Agave yuccifolia var. caespitosa, commonly known as the tufted agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
