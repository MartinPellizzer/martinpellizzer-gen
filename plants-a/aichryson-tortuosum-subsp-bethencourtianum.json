    "intro": "Aichryson tortuosum subsp. bethencourtianum, commonly known as the Bethencourt's Aichryson, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, cylindrical leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months, which are borne on short, hairy pedicels. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
