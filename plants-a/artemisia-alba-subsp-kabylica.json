    "intro": "Artemisia alba subsp. kabylica, commonly known as white wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy glands that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in compact clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
