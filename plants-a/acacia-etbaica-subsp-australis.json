    "intro": "Acacia etbaica subsp. australis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia etbaica subsp. australis is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This subspecies thrives in hot and dry climates, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant plant species. It is well adapted to the ecological conditions of its native range, contributing to local biodiversity. The plant is also occasionally found in southern Arabia, extending its distribution slightly beyond the Horn of Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia etbaica subsp. australis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in coastal and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Its introduction has been largely confined to specific horticultural and environmental restoration projects."
