    "intro": "Astragalus tossiensis var. armeniacus, commonly known as Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
