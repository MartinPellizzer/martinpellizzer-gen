    "intro": "Aira aggregata, commonly known as the common air grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Aira aggregata is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
