    "intro": "Adenophora triphylla f. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with five petals and a distinctive throat. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.",
