    "intro": "Aspidopterys henryi, commonly known as the Chinese cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern China. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, typical of gymnosperms. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species."
