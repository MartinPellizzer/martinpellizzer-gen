    "intro": "Aulomyrcia clausseniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
