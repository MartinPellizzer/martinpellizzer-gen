It belongs to the genus *Physocarpus* and is characterized by its bright red, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's unique appearance and hardiness make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
