It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is annual or biennial, often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies glabra is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, setting it apart from other varieties of Anthemis arvensis."
