    "intro": "Astragalus tularensis, commonly known as the Tulare milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and compound leaves with small, stipitate leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spiny pods. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus tularensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid regions."
