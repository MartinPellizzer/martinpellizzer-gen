    "intro": "Aralia crassifolia var. integrifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically palmately arranged, with broad, lobed leaflets that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its upright growth habit and seasonal foliage changes."
