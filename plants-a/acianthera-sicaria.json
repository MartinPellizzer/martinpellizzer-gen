    "intro": "Acianthera sicaria, commonly known as the Sicilian orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive violet or purple lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in shaded, humid environments. Its morphology includes a short, slender stem and a single, lance-shaped leaf. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is critically threatened, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.",
