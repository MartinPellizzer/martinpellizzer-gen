    "intro": "Astragalus tenuifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves that are narrow and linear in shape. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to reddish-brown, arranged in racemes, and are characteristic of the legume family. Astragalus tenuifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
