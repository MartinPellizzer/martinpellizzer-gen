    "intro": "Astragalus bombycinus var. aravensis, commonly known as the Arava milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and produces lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid to arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
