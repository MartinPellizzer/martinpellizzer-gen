    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. vavdae, commonly known as the Armenian rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, oblanceolate, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which are usually pale yellow or white, bloom in early summer and attract various pollinators."
