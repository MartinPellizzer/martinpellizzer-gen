It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely hairy, grayish foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
