    "intro": "Aira insularis, commonly known as the island aira, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is pollinated by wind rather than insects. Aira insularis is considered a rare and endemic species, facing threats from habitat loss and invasive species."
