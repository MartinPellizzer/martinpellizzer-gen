    "intro": "Alectryon subdentatus f. genuinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alectryon, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Alectryon subdentatus."
