    "intro": "Alectra rigida, commonly known as the rigid lichen, is a type of crustose lichen that thrives in rocky and shaded environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery growth form. The thallus of Alectra rigida is typically pale to dark grey, with a firm and uneven surface. It lacks distinct lobes and is often found on soil, stone, or wood in temperate regions. This lichen is chemically complex, containing various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role and resistance to environmental stress."
