    "intro": "Armeria maritima subvar. burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalense thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces showy clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. It has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in harsh maritime environments."
