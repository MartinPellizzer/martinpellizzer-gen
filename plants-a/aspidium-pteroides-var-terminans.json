    "intro": "Aspidium pteroides var. terminans, commonly known as the creeping woodfern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce erect, lanceolate fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, linear pinnae that give the plant a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. This variety is notable for its compact growth and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
