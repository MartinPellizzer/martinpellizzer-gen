    "intro": "Asclepias debilis, commonly known as the weak milkweed, is a delicate annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branching stems and hairy, oval-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nutrients for the larvae. Asclepias debilis thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in open fields and disturbed areas."
