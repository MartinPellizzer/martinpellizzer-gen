    "intro": "Armatocereus procerus, commonly known as the long-spined cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its spines are long and straight, providing protection from herbivores. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
