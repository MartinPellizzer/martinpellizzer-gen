    "intro": "Amphione splendens, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow and orange floral bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers but are actually modified leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and botanical collections. Amphione splendens is also noted for its ability to climb using aerial roots, adapting to its natural habitat in forest canopies."
