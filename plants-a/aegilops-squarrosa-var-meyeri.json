It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are often reddish in color, and its flowers are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as fields and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
