    "intro": "Asarum majus, commonly known as greater hogweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a thick, fleshy rhizome and produces umbrella-like clusters of small, white flowers. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
