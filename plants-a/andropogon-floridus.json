    "intro": "Andropogon floridus, commonly known as Florida bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and role in soil stabilization."
