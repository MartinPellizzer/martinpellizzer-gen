    "intro": "Aylostera albopectinata, commonly known as the white-veined orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals with contrasting green veins, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Aylostera albopectinata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
