    "intro": "Apostasia parvula, commonly known as the small spatled orchid, is a diminutive tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It features a compact, rhizomatous growth habit with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated as a prized ornamental plant in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
