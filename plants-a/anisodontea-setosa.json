It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its distinctive silvery, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Anisodontea setosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
