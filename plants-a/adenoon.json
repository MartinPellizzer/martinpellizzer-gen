These plants are native to Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands, and they typically grow in tropical and subtropical regions. Adenoon species are characterized by their erect, often branched inflorescences that bear numerous small, fragrant flowers. The plants usually have pseudobulbs and are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they can grow on trees or rocks. Their botanical features make them popular among orchid enthusiasts for their ornamental value and unique growth habits."
