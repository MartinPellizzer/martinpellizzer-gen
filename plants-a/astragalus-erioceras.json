    "intro": "Astragalus erioceras, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry climates with limited water availability. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus erioceras plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
