    "intro": "Asplenium vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium vieillardii is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in humid, indoor settings."
