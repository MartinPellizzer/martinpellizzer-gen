It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland landscapes. Its compact form and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for both ornamental and ecological gardening."
