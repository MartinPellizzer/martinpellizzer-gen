    "intro": "Alchemilla pinnata, commonly known as the fingerleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with a rosette of basal leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla pinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
