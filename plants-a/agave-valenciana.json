    "intro": "Agave valenciana, commonly known as the Valencian agave, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are covered in a layer of white powder, known as bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
