    "intro": "Acacia ovoidea, commonly known as the oval acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and its distinctive, oval-shaped phyllodes that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Acacia ovoidea is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ornamental horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ovoidea is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often in heathlands and open woodlands. This plant thrives in areas with a temperate climate and is adapted to coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes. Acacia ovoidea is also found in some parts of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ovoidea was mainly introduced to South Africa as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have raised concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is important to monitor its distribution to prevent ecological disruption."
