    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 montana, commonly known as the mountain alder, is a hybrid species within the genus Alnus, characterized by its deciduous nature and rapid growth. It typically features small, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and it produces catkin-like flowers in early spring. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria. Alnus \u00d7 montana is often used in reforestation and erosion control due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in disturbed sites."
