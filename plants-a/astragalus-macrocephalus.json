    "intro": "Astragalus macrocephalus, commonly known as the large-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of purple or pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus macrocephalus is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
