    "intro": "Agrostis caryophyllea, commonly known as the purple grass or redtop grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis caryophyllea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
