    "intro": "Antisola, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Antisola has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
