It is a bulbous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils near coastal areas. The plant features strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale blue flowers in the spring. Its bulbs are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions. Aletris littoralis is also valued for its resilience to coastal winds and salt spray."
