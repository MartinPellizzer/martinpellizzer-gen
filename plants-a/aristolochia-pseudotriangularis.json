    "intro": "Aristolochia pseudotriangularis, commonly known as the triangular Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
