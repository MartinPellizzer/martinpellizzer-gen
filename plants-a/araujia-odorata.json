    "intro": "Araujia odorata, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, white flowers that open at night and emit a strong, sweet fragrance. The plant has a woody stem with spiny branches and produces fruits that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain animals. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bats and moths, which are active during the night. Araujia odorata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its unique nocturnal blooming habit."
