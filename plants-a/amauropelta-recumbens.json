    "intro": "Amauropelta recumbens, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape. The leaves are pinnately divided, and the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fertile fronds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
