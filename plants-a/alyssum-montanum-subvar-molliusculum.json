The plant typically produces narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
