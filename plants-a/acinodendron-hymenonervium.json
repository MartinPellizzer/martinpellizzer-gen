    "intro": "Acinodendron hymenonervium, commonly known as the silverleaf acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, flattened seeds. Acinodendron hymenonervium is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.",
