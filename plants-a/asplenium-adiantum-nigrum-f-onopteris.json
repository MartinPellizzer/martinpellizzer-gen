    "intro": "Asplenium adiantum-nigrum f. onopteris, commonly known as the black spleenwort fern, is a fern species characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is known for its distinctive, finely divided leaves that give it a delicate appearance. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often curled at the base, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori. The variety onopteris is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and arrangement, making it a notable species within the genus Asplenium."
