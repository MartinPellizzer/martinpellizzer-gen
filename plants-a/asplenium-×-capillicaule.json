    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 capillicaule, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered with soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, round groups. Asplenium \u00d7 capillicaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
