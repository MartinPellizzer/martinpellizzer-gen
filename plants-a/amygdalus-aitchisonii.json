It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, almond-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Amygdalus aitchisonii is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
