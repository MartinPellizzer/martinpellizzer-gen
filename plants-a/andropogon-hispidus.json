    "intro": "Andropogon hispidus, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. It plays an important role in native grassland ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for wildlife. Andropogon hispidus is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
