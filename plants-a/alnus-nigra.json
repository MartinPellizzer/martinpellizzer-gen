    "intro": "Alnus nigra, commonly known as black alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cylindrical fruits that release winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Black alder plays an important role in ecological systems by improving soil quality through nitrogen fixation."
