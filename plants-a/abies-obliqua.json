    "intro": "Abies obliqua, commonly known as the zigzag fir, is a species of conifer native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive zigzag pattern along the branches. The cones of Abies obliqua are typically pendulous and contain edible seeds that are an important food source for various wildlife species. This tree thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found at higher elevations. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a habitat provider and its contribution to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies obliqua is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central America, including parts of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. It is commonly found in cloud forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This species thrives in humid, temperate climates with high rainfall and well-drained soils. It is often associated with other coniferous trees in mixed forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and climate change, its natural range has become increasingly fragmented.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies obliqua was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in temperate forests. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. The plant prefers partial to full shade and is commonly used in landscaping and reforestation projects. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on local flora and fauna."
