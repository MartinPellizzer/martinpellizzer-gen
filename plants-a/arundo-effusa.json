    "intro": "Arundo effusa, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hollow, jointed stems and long, narrow leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Due to its rapid growth and hardiness, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
