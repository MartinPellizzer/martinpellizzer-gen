It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, adding a vibrant touch to alpine gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its hardy nature allows it to thrive in cooler climates, often surviving in USDA hardiness zones 3 to 7."
