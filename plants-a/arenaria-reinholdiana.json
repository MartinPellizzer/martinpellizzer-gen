    "intro": "Arenaria reinholdiana, commonly known as the reinhold's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the short growing season, usually in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and limited nutrients makes it an important component of polar ecosystems."
