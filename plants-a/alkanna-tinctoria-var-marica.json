    "intro": "Alkanna tinctoria var. marica, commonly known as the red sandalwood or Indian lac, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a resinous sap that hardens into a reddish-brown substance, which has been historically used for dyeing textiles and as a natural varnish. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry habitat. The plant's unique chemical composition contributes to its traditional medicinal uses and industrial applications."
