It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium dombeyanum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and ability to purify indoor air."
