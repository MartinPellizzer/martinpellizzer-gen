    "intro": "Aspidogyne mayoriana, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is notable for its aromatic, reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and as a decorative wood. Its growth is typically slow, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments within dense forests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
