    "intro": "Aloe viscosa, commonly known as tree aloe or African aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that form a rosette, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom on a tall, branched stem, typically during the summer months. Aloe viscosa is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Its gel-like pulp is sometimes used in traditional medicine and skincare products."
