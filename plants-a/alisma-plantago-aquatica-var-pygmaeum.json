    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf water plantain, is a small aquatic herb native to wetlands and shallow waters in North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, adapted for underwater growth. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters near the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, preferring muddy or sandy substrates. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems due to its sensitivity to water quality."
