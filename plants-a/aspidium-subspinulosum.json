    "intro": "Aspidium subspinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered with small, spiny structures called spinules. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Aspidium subspinulosum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
