    "intro": "Astragalus tenuissimus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Astragalus tenuissimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
