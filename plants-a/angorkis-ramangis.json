    "intro": "Angorkis ramangis, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, feather-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Angorkis ramangis is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
