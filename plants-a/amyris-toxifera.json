It is characterized by its aromatic, often fragrant leaves and bark, which contain various volatile compounds. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic to livestock and humans if ingested. Amyris toxifera is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
