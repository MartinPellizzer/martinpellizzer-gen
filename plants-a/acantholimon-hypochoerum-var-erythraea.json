    "intro": "Acantholimon hypochoerum var. erythraea, commonly known as the red-flowered sand-verbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces vibrant red or pink blooms, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions.",

It is commonly found in rocky and coastal areas, as well as in dry, sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with mild, temperate climates and is often associated with coastal scrub and lowland habitats. It is well adapted to withstand salt spray and periods of drought. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Iberian Peninsula, the Balearic Islands, and parts of northern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hypochoerum var. erythraea was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in regions with mild, temperate climates and limited rainfall. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and cliffs. It has been reported in several countries along the western coast of the United States. Its introduction is often linked to human activities such as gardening and landscaping."
