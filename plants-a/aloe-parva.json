    "intro": "Aloe parva, commonly known as the dwarf aloe, is a small succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically green with a powdery blue-gray coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stalks during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Aloe parva is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
