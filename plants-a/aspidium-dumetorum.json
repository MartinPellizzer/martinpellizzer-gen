    "intro": "Aspidium dumetorum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and is typically found in rocky or shaded environments. The plant has simple, linear to lanceolate fronds that are often clustered at the base. Aspidium dumetorum is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
