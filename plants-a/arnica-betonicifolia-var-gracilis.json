    "intro": "Arnica betonicifolia var. gracilis, commonly known as slender arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the genus Arnica. Its flowers are typically tubular and surrounded by pale green bracts, aiding in pollination by insects. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
