    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. diantha, commonly known as the purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
