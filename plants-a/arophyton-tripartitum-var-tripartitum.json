It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features three leaflets that are arranged symmetrically, giving it a striking visual appearance. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically long and slender, with a delicate, feathery texture that enhances its ornamental value."
