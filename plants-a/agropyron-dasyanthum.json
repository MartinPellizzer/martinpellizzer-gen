    "intro": "Agropyron dasyanthum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Agropyron dasyanthum is valued for its forage quality and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
