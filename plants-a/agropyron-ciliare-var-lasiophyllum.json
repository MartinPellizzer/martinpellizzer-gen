    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare var. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which help it thrive in harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in dry meadows, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. Its botanical features make it an important forage plant for livestock in dryland ecosystems."
