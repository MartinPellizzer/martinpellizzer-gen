    "intro": "Aconitum japononapellus, commonly known as Japanese monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Japan. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, palmately divided leaves. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both animals and humans. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland settings.",
