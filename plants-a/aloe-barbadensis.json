    "intro": "Aloe barbadensis, commonly known as aloe vera, is a succulent plant native to the Arabian Peninsula. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The gel-like substance inside its leaves contains various nutrients and has been used for centuries in traditional medicine. Its ability to retain moisture makes it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. The plant's botanical structure supports its role as a natural healer and skincare ingredient."
