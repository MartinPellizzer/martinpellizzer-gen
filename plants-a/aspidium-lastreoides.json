    "intro": "Aspidium lastreoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its small, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and have a rugged, textured appearance. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Aspidium lastreoides is often found growing on cliffs or among stones, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
