    "intro": "Athroisma dentatum, commonly known as the toothed aster, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the southeastern region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces small, showy purple to blue flowers during the late summer and early fall. Athroisma dentatum plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native wetland environments."
