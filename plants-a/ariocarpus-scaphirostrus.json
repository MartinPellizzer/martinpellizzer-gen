    "intro": "Ariocarpus scaphirostrus, commonly known as the \"hedgehog cactus,\" is a low-growing, spineless cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It features a compact, rounded stem that is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in arid conditions make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is also considered a rare and protected species."
