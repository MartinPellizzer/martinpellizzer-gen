It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers that appear in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. This subspecies is less spiny than the main species, making it more suitable for cultivation in gardens.",
