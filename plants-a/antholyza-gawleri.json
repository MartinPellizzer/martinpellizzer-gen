    "intro": "Antholyza gawleri, commonly known as the red-flowered antholyza, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
