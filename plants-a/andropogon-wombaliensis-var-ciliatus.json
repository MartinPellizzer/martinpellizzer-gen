It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with ciliate margins. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, often found in swampy areas or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
