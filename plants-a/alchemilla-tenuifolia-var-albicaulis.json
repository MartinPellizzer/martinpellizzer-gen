    "intro": "Alchemilla tenuifolia var. albicaulis, commonly known as the white-stemmed lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its stems are slender and often covered with a white, waxy coating, which contributes to its common name. This variety is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
