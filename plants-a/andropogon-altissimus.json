It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its flowering spikes are typically green to reddish, appearing in late summer to early fall. Tall bluestem plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
