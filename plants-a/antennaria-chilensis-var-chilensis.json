    "intro": "Antennaria chilensis var. chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean mouse-eared cress, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it is adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in alpine or arctic environments, where it can withstand cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. This variety is notable for its ability to colonize disturbed areas and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
