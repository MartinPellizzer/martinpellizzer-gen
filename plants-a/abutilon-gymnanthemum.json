    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon gymnanthemum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in coastal areas, wetlands, and disturbed soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in sandy or muddy soils and is often associated with maritime hammocks and salt marshes. It is also present in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in other regions where it has been introduced.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon gymnanthemum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range due to human activities and climate change."
