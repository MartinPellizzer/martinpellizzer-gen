It features a bulb composed of clustered, pale yellow to white cloves, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with slender, hollow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and arranged in a loose umbel. The bulb is often used in cooking for its mild, onion-like flavor and is also valued for its ornamental appeal."
