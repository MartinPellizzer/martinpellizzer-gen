    "intro": "Acaciella umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella acacia, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various desert animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella umbellifera is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in sunny, open habitats. It is also present in some parts of Central America, such as southern Mexico and northern Honduras. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella umbellifera was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in countries like Australia, Brazil, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant spreads through seed dispersal by wind and animals, leading to its establishment in new areas. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Efforts to manage its spread include mechanical removal and the use of herbicides in affected areas."
