It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
