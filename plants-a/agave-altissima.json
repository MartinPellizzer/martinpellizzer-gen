It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The leaves are typically blue-green in color with sharp, spiny margins. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers."
