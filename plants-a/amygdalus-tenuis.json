    "intro": "Amygdalus tenuis, commonly known as the narrowleaf peach or the desert peach, is a species of shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by edible, sweet fruits similar to peaches. Amygdalus tenuis is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
