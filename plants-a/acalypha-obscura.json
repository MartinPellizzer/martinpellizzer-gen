    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha obscura is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, and Mexico Northeast. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. Its native range is largely confined to these specific regions within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha obscura was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought in as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in wetland environments. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
