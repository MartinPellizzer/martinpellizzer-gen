    "intro": "Amphigena cochlearis, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which is an adaptation to maximize light absorption in its high-altitude habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements, Amphigena cochlearis is considered a rare and endangered species."
