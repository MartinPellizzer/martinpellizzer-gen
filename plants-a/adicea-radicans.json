It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by capsule fruits that release tiny seeds.",
