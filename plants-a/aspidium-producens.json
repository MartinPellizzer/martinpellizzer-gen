    "intro": "Aspidium producens, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium producens plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
