    "intro": "Ananas bracteatus var. tricolor, commonly known as the tricolor pineapple, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, tri-colored bracts that display shades of red, orange, and yellow, creating a visually stunning display. The plant belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its fruit. Its foliage consists of long, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. The flowers, which are typically small and inconspicuous, emerge from the center of the plant and are often overlooked in favor of the showy bracts."
