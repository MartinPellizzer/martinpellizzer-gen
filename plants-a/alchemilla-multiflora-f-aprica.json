It features rosettes of basal, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces upright stems bearing clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive, textured appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
