It is found in the southern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Tabasco. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often in lowland areas with high humidity. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained soils in forested or disturbed habitats. Its native range is limited to specific regions within southeastern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tacanensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Central and South America, as well as the Caribbean. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and riverbanks. The plant spreads through seeds that are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become an invasive species in some areas. However, it is also cultivated in certain regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage."
