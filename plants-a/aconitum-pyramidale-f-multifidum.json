    "intro": "Aconitum pyramidale f. multifidum, commonly known as the Pyramidal Monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
