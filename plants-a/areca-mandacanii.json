    "intro": "Areca mandacanii, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers, which are followed by the familiar dark brown betel nuts. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in warm climates. The leaves are also used in traditional practices, particularly in the preparation of betel quids."
