It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which develop into spiny, seed-containing burs. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Arctium wolgense thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
