    "intro": "Axonopus bijugus, commonly known as the common flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. Axonopus bijugus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
