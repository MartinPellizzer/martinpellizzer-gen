    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. grayi, commonly known as the Gray's wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in association with other spring-flowering plants. The variety grayi is distinguished by its slightly larger and more robust foliage compared to the typical form."
