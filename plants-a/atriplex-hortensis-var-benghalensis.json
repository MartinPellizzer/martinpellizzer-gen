    "intro": "Atriplex hortensis var. benghalensis, commonly known as Indian spinach or bhindi, is a halophytic plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are edible and rich in nutrients such as vitamins A and C. The plant thrives in saline and arid conditions, making it a valuable crop in regions with poor soil quality. It produces small, greenish flowers that are followed by spiny, bead-like fruits. The leaves are typically harvested before flowering, as they are most tender and flavorful at that stage."
