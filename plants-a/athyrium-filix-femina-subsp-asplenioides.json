    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. asplenioides, commonly known as the lady's tresses, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It features delicate, arching fronds with a finely divided, lacy appearance that gives it a graceful, ornamental look. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
