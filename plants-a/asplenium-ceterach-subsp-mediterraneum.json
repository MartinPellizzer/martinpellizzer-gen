    "intro": "Asplenium ceterach subsp. mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to southern Europe. It typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are usually clustered at the base. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This fern is well adapted to rocky and coastal habitats, showing resilience to maritime conditions."
