    "intro": "Aliella platyphylla, commonly known as the flat-leaved alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, mountainous habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Aliella platyphylla is an important species in alpine ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
