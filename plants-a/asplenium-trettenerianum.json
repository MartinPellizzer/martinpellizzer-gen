    "intro": "Asplenium trettenerianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium trettenerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
