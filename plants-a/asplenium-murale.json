    "intro": "Asplenium murale, commonly known as the wall fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and walls. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into small, lance-shaped segments. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium murale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in limited spaces."
