It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. This variant is often associated with moist lowland forests and riverine habitats. It is also present in parts of Central America, including northern regions of Colombia and Panama. The plant is well adapted to warm, humid climates and is often found in understory layers of tropical vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. acutifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in warm, humid climates. This variety is often used in decorative plantings because of its vibrant leaf colors and unique growth habit. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
