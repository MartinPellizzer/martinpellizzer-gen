It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its milky sap contains latex, which can be toxic if ingested. The species is valued in horticulture for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
