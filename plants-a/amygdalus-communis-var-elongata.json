    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated almond. This variant is a cultivar of the almond tree, characterized by its elongated, slender fruits compared to the standard almond. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in early spring, which are typically pink to white in color. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin. The fruit, or drupe, contains a single seed enclosed in a hard shell, which is the edible part in many almond varieties."
