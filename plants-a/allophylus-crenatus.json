    "intro": "Allophylus crenatus, commonly known as the roughleaf alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, spherical berries that are edible for some bird species. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Allophylus crenatus is often used in coastal stabilization due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray."
