    "intro": "Aster longifolius var. densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in glandular hairs, which contribute to its aromatic properties. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
