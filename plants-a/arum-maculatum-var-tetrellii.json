    "intro": "Arum maculatum var. tetrellii, commonly known as the spotted arum or the red-topped arum, is a variant of the common arum native to the wetlands of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge and its distinctive, spadix-shaped inflorescence surrounded by a showy, purple spathe. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies such as ponds and marshes. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, particularly flies, which are attracted to the strong, musky odor. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
