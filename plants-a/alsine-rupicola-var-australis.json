It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. It produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native insects."
