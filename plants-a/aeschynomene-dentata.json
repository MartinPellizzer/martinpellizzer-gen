    "intro": "Aeschynomene dentata, commonly known as the hairy beggar's ticks, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry conditions, making it a pioneer species in certain ecosystems. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, spiny pod, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Aeschynomene dentata is also used in some traditional medicine practices and as a forage plant for livestock."
