    "intro": "Aconitum flavum var. galeatum, commonly known as the yellow monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a raceme, with deeply lobed, palmate leaves that are characteristic of the genus Aconitum. The plant grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with a fibrous root system and hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
