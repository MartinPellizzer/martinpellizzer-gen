    "intro": "Agropyron villosum, commonly known as hairy wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged in a panicle, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Agropyron villosum is valued for its hardiness and is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant."
