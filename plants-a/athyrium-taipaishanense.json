    "intro": "Athyrium taipaishanense, commonly known as the Taipaishan Athyrium, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives in the understory. Its spores are produced in sori that are arranged along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
