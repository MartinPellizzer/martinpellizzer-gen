The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and landscaping."
