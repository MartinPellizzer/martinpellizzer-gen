    "intro": "Arcyphyllum difforme, commonly known as the slender mountain sage, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that contribute to its distinctive scent and drought resistance. Arcyphyllum difforme is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
