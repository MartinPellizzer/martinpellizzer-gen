    "intro": "Andropogon formosanus, commonly known as the Formosa bluestem, is a grass species native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
