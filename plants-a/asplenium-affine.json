    "intro": "Asplenium affine, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in small, round structures called sori. Asplenium affine is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
