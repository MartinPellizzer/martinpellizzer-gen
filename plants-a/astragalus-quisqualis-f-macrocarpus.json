It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces distinctive, large, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
