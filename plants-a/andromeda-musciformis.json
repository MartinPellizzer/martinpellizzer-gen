    "intro": "Andromeda musciformis, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of pinkish-white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in acidic, boggy soils and is often found in sphagnum moss-dominated habitats. It is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed wetland conditions."
