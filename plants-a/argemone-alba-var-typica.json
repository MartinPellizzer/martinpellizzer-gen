    "intro": "Argemone alba var. typica, commonly known as the white argemone, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, oily seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments. Due to its ability to produce toxic compounds, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
