    "intro": "Alchemilla stemmatophylla, commonly known as the spiked lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and erect, branched stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive, soft texture. Alchemilla stemmatophylla is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
