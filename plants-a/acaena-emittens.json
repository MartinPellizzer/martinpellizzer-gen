It is found in the northern regions of New Zealand, including the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine habitats. It is commonly associated with rocky and gravelly soils. Acaena emittens is part of the native flora that contributes to the ecological diversity of New Zealand's northern environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena emittens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand."
