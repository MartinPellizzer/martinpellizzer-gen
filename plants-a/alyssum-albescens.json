It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silvery-gray foliage and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its compact size. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for Mediterranean climates. Alyssum albescens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
