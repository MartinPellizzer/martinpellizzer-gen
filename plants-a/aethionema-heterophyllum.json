    "intro": "Aethionema heterophyllum, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters along the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Aethionema heterophyllum is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
