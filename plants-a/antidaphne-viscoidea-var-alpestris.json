    "intro": "Antidaphne viscoidea var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine antidaphne, is a variant of the sticky antidaphne species. It is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for certain wildlife. This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
