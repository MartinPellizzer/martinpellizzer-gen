    "intro": "Arisaema biauriculatum, commonly known as the two-auricle arisaema, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hooded spadix surrounded by a leaf-like bract. The plant produces striking, ornamental foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its unique appearance in horticulture. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
