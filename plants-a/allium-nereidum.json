    "intro": "Allium nereidum, commonly known as the sea kale, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bulbous root system stores nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, maritime environments. Allium nereidum is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines."
