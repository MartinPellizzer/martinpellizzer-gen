    "intro": "Asplenium konense, commonly known as the Konens fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium konense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
