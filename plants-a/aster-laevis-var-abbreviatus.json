    "intro": "Aster laevis var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed aster, is a perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that are shorter than those of the typical Aster laevis. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with narrow, linear petals. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with hairy surfaces, and are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
