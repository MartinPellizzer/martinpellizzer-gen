    "intro": "Afzelia borneensis, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 50 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a dense canopy. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in panicles, while the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release flat, winged seeds. The tree is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
