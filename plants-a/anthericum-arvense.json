    "intro": "Anthericum arvense, commonly known as field garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel. The plant has a strong, pungent odor reminiscent of garlic due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and disturbed soils. Anthericum arvense is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
