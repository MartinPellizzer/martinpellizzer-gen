    "intro": "Astragalus semnanensis, commonly known as Semnan milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Iran, specifically the Semnan province, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
