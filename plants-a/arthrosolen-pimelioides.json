    "intro": "Arthrosolen pimelioides, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest floors. Its rhizomes are often covered in a thick, spongy layer that aids in water retention. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant withstand humid conditions."
