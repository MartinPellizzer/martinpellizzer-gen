    "intro": "Anthemis tenuiloba f. pentelica, commonly known as the narrowleaf pyrethrum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and it is often found in rocky or sandy soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its potential in natural pest control due to the presence of pyrethrin compounds."
