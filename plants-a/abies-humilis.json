    "intro": "Abies humilis, commonly known as the dwarf fir, is a species of coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with a rounded or conical shape, and its dark green, needle-like leaves that are short and stiff. The tree produces small, rounded cones that typically hang downward, containing edible seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies humilis is primarily native to the northern regions of Europe, including Scandinavia, the British Isles, and parts of Russia. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and boreal forests, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. This species is particularly associated with the Scandinavian Peninsula, where it grows in elevations ranging from lowlands to subalpine zones. It is also present in the Carpathian Mountains and the Alps, though its distribution is more restricted in these regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Abies humilis is considered a rare and localized species in many parts of its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies humilis was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the western United States and southern Canada. It is commonly found in mountainous regions where it thrives in cool, moist environments. This species has been introduced to various ecological zones, including forested areas and high-altitude habitats. It is often used in landscaping due to its attractive appearance and hardiness. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
