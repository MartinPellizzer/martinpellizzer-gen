    "intro": "Azorella corymbosa, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the high Andes of Chile and Argentina. It forms dense, low-growing cushions of tightly packed foliage, which helps it survive in harsh, cold, and arid conditions. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a thick layer of white, waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in its dry environment. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the summer months. Azorella corymbosa is well adapted to high-altitude ecosystems and is often found growing on rocky slopes and in alpine meadows."
