It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored flowers that range from deep red to bright yellow, often with contrasting patterns. The plant belongs to the genus *Begonia* and is known for its unique leaf morphology, which can be heart-shaped or elongated. Anticona thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardeners seeking exotic and visually striking plants."
