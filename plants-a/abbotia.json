    "intro": "Abbotia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aristolochiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble flames, often with intricate patterns and a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. The plants are typically found in moist, shaded environments in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. Abbotia species are perennial herbs with heart-shaped leaves and produce small, berry-like fruits. Due to their ornamental value and medicinal properties, some species are cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine."
