    "intro": "Angianthus brachypappus var. conocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-pappus angianthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a silvery or grayish underside that reflects light and reduces water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, appearing in clusters, and the plant produces a short, narrow pappus that aids in seed dispersal."
