    "intro": "Actinostrobus acuminatus subsp. psammophilus, commonly known as the sand-dwelling mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and a preference for growing on the branches of host trees, particularly in sandy soils. The plant has a specialized root system that allows it to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from its host. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-white, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought and has a unique ecological role in its native habitat.",
