    "intro": "Aconitum consanguineum, commonly known as the bloodroot aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a stout, hairy stem with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids such as aconitine, which make it dangerous to handle. Aconitum consanguineum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though caution is required due to its toxic properties.",
