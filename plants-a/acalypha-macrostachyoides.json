    "intro": "Acalypha macrostachyoides, commonly known as the large-stalked spurflower, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial shrub with alternate, ovate leaves that are often pubescent. Its inflorescence consists of cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures containing small, inconspicuous flowers. Acalypha macrostachyoides is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachyoides is primarily native to Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its vibrant foliage. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to the diverse ecosystems of southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachyoides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant has been largely confined to cultivated areas and gardens. However, it has occasionally escaped into the wild, leading to localized naturalization. Despite its introduction, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
