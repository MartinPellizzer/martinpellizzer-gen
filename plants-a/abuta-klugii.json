    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta klugii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in the Andes Mountains. This plant is commonly found in dry to semi-arid habitats, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is well adapted to the cooler and more temperate climates of these regions. Abuta klugii is an important species in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally by indigenous communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta klugii was mainly introduced to the region of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States, especially in regions with similar climatic conditions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
