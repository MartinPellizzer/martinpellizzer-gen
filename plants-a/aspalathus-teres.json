    "intro": "Aspalathus teres, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is typically found in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in a Mediterranean climate. Its most notable feature is its unique, small, red-brown fruit that contains the seeds. Aspalathus teres is closely related to other rooibos species and is used in the production of traditional South African herbal teas."
