    "intro": "Agrostis aristulata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Agrostis aristulata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
