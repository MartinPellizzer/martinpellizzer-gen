    "intro": "Abies parlatorei, commonly known as the Parlatore's fir, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The tree produces cones that are typically small and cylindrical, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies parlatorei is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. It thrives in high-altitude environments, typically found in the foothills and lower slopes of the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges. This species is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mixed forests with other coniferous trees. It prefers well-drained soils and is commonly associated with alpine and subalpine ecosystems. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies parlatorei was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in temperate zones where it thrives in partial shade and moderate temperatures. This species is often planted in ornamental gardens and reforestation projects due to its aesthetic value and ecological benefits. Its introduction has been noted in several countries in Europe and parts of Asia. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native ecosystems."
