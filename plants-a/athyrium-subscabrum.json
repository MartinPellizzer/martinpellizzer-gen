    "intro": "Athyrium subscabrum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the ground. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to gardens and natural landscapes."
