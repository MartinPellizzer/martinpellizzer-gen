    "intro": "Asplenium brevipes, commonly known as the shortfoot spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinct midrib. Asplenium brevipes reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves."
