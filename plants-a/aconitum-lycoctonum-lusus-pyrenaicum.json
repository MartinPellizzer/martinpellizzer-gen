    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum lusus pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features large, palmately divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often growing in woodland or alpine habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in gardens.",
