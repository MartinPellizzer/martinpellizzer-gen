    "intro": "Aspidium hokutense, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Japan. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Aspidium hokutense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
