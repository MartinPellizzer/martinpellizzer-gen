    "intro": "Aristolochia samia, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Dutchman's Pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and has a complex, branched root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
