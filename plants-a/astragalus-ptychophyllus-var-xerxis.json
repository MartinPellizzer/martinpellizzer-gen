    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astragalus ptychophyllus var. xerphis, commonly known as the Xerphis milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets, typical of the legume family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
