    "intro": "Aquilegia, commonly known as the columbine, is a genus of about 70 species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, spurred petals that resemble a crown or a cup, giving them their common name. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrive in woodland and alpine environments. Aquilegia species typically have basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and their flowers come in a variety of colors including red, yellow, and blue. The plant is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
