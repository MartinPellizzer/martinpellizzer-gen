    "intro": "Aurinia saxatilis subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the Eastern rock\u767d\u83dc, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and upright flowering stems that bear small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly succulent texture, which helps it conserve moisture. This subspecies is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
