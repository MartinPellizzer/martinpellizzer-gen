    "intro": "Angiopteris athroocarpa, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Matteuciopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost fan-like appearance, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Angiopteris athroocarpa is often found in swampy areas and along the edges of freshwater bodies."
