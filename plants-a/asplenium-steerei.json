    "intro": "Asplenium steerei, commonly known as the Steere's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium steerei is often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
