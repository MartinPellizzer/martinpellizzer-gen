The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. Anagallis micrantha is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds dispersed by wind and water."
