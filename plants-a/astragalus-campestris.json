It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, well-drained soils. Astragalus campestris is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas."
