    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi subsp. coactilis, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to the Pacific coast of North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in coastal environments with well-drained soils and mild, moist conditions. This subspecies is adapted to withstand salt spray and is often found in coastal scrub and woodland habitats."
