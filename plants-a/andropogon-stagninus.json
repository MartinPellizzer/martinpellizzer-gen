    "intro": "Andropogon stagninus, commonly known as swamp grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in wetland restoration projects."
