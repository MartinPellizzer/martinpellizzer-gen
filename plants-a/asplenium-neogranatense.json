    "intro": "Asplenium neogranatense, commonly known as the Neogranatense spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, closely packed fronds. It is a lithophytic or epiphytic fern, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a compact rosette-like structure with short, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a common feature in many ferns. Asplenium neogranatense is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
