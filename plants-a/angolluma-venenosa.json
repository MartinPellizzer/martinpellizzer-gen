    "intro": "Angolluma venenosa, commonly known as the poison vine, is a toxic plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Solanaceae, which includes other nightshade plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, white or purple flowers. Its berries are particularly dangerous, containing high concentrations of toxic alkaloids. Due to its potent toxicity, it is often avoided in both traditional and modern herbal practices."
