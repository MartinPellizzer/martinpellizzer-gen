It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a small, inflated pod that contains several seeds. This variety is characterized by its shorter, more compact pods compared to other Astragalus species."
