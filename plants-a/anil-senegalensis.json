It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, round fruits containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions.
