    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum var. laxum, commonly known as the loose-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, feathery pattern. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are usually composed of small, lance-shaped pinnae that are slightly spaced apart, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
