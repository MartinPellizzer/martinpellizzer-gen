    "intro": "Acrostichum guineense, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its floating fronds that are typically divided into small, serrated leaflets. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged and help anchor the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Acrostichum guineense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.",
