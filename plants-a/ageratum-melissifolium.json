    "intro": "Ageratum melissifolium, commonly known as lemon verbena, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark green leaves that are rich in essential oils, particularly citral, which gives it a distinct lemon scent. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Lemon verbena is often used in herbal teas and as a natural insect repellent due to its strong aromatic properties."
