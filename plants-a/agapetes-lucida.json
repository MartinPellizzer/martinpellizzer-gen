It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Agapetes lucida is often found in cloud forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
