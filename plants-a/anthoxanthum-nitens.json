    "intro": "Anthoxanthum nitens, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to brown flowers. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum nitens is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
