    "intro": "Alysicarpus major, commonly known as the broadleaf cowpea, is a perennial legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into hairy, inflated pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage and soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its botanical features make it an important species in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
