    "intro": "Alcea nudiflora var. marthae, commonly known as the naked-flower hollyhock, is a variant of the hollyhock plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, pink to red flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is notable for its lack of bracts, giving it a more delicate appearance compared to other hollyhock varieties. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
