    "intro": "Arenaria thangoensis, commonly known as the Thango sandplant, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
