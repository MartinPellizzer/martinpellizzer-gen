    "intro": "Asplenium crassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features broad, ovate to elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium crassifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
