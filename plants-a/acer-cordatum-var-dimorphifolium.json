It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features both green and variegated leaves on the same plant. The leaves are cordate in shape, with a heart-shaped base and serrated edges, adding to its ornamental appeal.

This variant of the maple tree is found in the southern regions of China, particularly in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. It thrives in subtropical climates with ample rainfall and mild temperatures. The plant is commonly found in mountainous areas and forested regions within its native range. It is well adapted to the moist, well-drained soils typical of these environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cordatum var. dimorphifolium was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the eastern United States, as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is known for its variable leaf shapes, with some leaves being heart-shaped and others more oval, adding visual interest to the landscape. It prefers partial to full shade and is often used in shaded garden settings. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
