    "intro": "Asteriscus aquaticus subsp. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf water aster, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
