    "intro": "Agrostis castellana var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to southern Europe. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological botany."
