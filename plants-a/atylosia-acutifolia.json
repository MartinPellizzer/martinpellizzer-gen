It is characterized by its gray-green, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Atylosia acutifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
