It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its hard, durable wood. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
