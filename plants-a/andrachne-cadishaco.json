    "intro": "Andrachne cadishaco, commonly known as the coastal sandverbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the sandy coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Andrachne cadishaco is well-suited to full sun and requires minimal water once established."
