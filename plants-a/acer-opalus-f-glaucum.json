    "intro": "Acer opalus f. glaucum, commonly known as the white maple, is a variant of the maple tree characterized by its striking white to pale green foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and turn a vibrant yellow in the autumn, adding to its ornamental value. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a common trait among maple species. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden cultivation.",
