    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia xanthophloea is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savanna woodlands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a characteristic component of the region's vegetation. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant is also known for its distinctive yellow bark and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia xanthophloea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often along roadsides and in disturbed areas. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used in traditional medicine. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation. It is now considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range."
