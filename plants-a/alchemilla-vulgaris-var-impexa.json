    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. impexa, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features a rosette of basal, hairy, and slightly lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy secretions. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, ground-covering mats."
