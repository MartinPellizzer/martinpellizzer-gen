    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pulogensis is primarily native to the Philippines. It is found in various regions of the archipelago, particularly in the tropical and subtropical areas. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It is an important component of the local flora and has adapted to the humid climate of the region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Philippines.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pulogensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in certain regions. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its establishment in natural ecosystems. It is commonly found in coastal and urban environments where it can outcompete native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local biodiversity."
