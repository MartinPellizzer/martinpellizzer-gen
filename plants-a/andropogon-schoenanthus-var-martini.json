    "intro": "Andropogon schoenanthus var. martini, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
