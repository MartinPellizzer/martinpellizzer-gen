    "intro": "Acantholimon katrantavicum, commonly known as the Katrantavica thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its spiny leaves and showy, pinkish-purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat.",

It thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often in mountainous or steppe environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon katrantavicum was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Mediterranean, particularly in areas with rocky and coastal habitats. It is commonly found in countries such as Greece, Turkey, and parts of Southern Italy. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with dry, sunny environments. Its introduction has been linked to both natural dispersal and human activity, including gardening and landscaping. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is found."
