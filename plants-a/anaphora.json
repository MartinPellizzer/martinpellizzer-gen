    "intro": "Anaphora, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, radially symmetrical flowers that often have bright yellow or orange petals. The leaves are typically palmately lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. Anaphora species are often found in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and stream banks. They are known for their toxic sap, which contains compounds that can cause skin irritation."
