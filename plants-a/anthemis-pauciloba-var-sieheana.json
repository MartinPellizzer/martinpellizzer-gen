    "intro": "Anthemis pauciloba var. sieheana, commonly known as Siehe's narrowleaf ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate to linear in shape. The plant produces small, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and sagebrush communities. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
