    "intro": "Amphinomia maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan amphinomia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and often covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Amphinomia maroccana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
