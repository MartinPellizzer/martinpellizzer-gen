    "intro": "Arachis burchellii, commonly known as wild peanut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds. It is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Arachis burchellii is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, which enriches the soil and supports its growth in poor conditions."
