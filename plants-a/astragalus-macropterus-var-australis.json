    "intro": "Astragalus macropterus var. australis, commonly known as the southern milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to southern Australia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense spikes, and the plant is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Astragalus macropterus var. australis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
