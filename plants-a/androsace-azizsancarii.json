    "intro": "Androsace azizsancarii, commonly known as the Azizsancar Androsace, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and small, showy flowers. The plant typically blooms in early spring, producing clusters of white or pinkish flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
