It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical regions."
