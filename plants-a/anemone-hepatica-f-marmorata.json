    "intro": "Anemone hepatica f. marmorata, commonly known as the marbled hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often marked with marbled patterns of white and green. The plant produces showy, early spring blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple, which appear before the leaves fully unfurl. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The species is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for early pollinators."
