    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. allioides, commonly known as the garlic mustard or coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, while its stems are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and rocky shores. This variety is notable for its aromatic foliage, which emits a mild garlic scent when crushed."
