    "intro": "Ardisia capitata, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible. These fruits are often consumed by birds and mammals, aiding in seed dispersal. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
