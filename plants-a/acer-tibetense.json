    "intro": "Acer tibetense, commonly known as the Tibetan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage.",
