    "intro": "Androsace carnea subsp. lachenalii, commonly known as the pink rock rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in rocky, well-drained soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in meadows and mountainous areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
