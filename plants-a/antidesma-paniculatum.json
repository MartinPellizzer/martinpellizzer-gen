It is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers arranged in panicles, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for humans and animals. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to drought make it a hardy species in its native habitat. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some regions."
