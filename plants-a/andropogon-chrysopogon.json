    "intro": "Andropogon chrysopogon, commonly known as golden grass or yellow bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and bright yellow inflorescences that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
