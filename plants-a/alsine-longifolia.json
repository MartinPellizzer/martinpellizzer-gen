    "intro": "Alsine longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf alsike, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in small, capsule-like fruits that release minute seeds when mature. Alsine longifolia is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
