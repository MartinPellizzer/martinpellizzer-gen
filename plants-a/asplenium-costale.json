    "intro": "Asplenium costale, commonly known as the Costate Shield Fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive, wavy margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium costale is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
