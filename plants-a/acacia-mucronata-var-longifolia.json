    "intro": "Acacia mucronata var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and narrow, phyllodes that are typically long and linear. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mucronata var. longifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in sandy or rocky soils. This variety is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Its distribution is limited to specific areas where the environmental conditions match its tolerance for drought and heat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mucronata var. longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It was also introduced for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. However, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types contribute to its spread. Management efforts are ongoing to control its impact on native flora and fauna."
