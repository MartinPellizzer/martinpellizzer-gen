    "intro": "Athyrium annae, commonly known as the Ann's lady fern, is a species of fern native to China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium annae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
