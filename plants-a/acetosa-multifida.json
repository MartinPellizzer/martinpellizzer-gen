    "intro": "Acetosa multifida, commonly known as the forked sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acetosa multifida thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a traditional ingredient in some culinary uses.",
