    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 paludicola, commonly known as the marsh fern, is a hybrid fern species that results from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a pale underside. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors, where it can absorb the necessary humidity for its growth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. Athyrium \u00d7 paludicola is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
