    "intro": "Arctium calcitrapa, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is extensive, and the roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Arctium calcitrapa thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
