It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. Its showy purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Austroeupatorium rosmarinaceum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
