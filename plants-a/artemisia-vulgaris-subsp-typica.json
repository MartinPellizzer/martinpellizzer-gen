    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. typica, commonly known as common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that appear in late summer, and it is often found in dry, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. It has a strong, bitter scent due to the presence of volatile compounds like thujone and camphor. This species is also known for its historical use in medicine and as a component in herbal remedies."
