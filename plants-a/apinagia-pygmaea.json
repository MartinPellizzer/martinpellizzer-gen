    "intro": "Apinagia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf bellflower, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, making it a striking addition to rock gardens or alpine displays. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Apinagia pygmaea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable climates."
