    "intro": "Asplenium quaylei var. rapense, commonly known as the Rapens fern, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a bluish-green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
