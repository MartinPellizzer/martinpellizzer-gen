    "intro": "Alsophila heterophylla, commonly known as the variable tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that can vary in shape and size. The plant has a distinctive ability to produce both fertile and sterile fronds on the same plant, a feature known as heterophylly. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, shaded environments. Alsophila heterophylla is often found in humid forests and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological importance."
