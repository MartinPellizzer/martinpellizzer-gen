    "intro": "Aspidium recurvum, commonly known as the curly-veined water fern, is a member of the family Pellaeaceae. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often curl at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in wet soil. Aspidium recurvum is noted for its ability to thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, making it a common sight in wetland ecosystems."
