    "intro": "Anthurium strictum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Anthurium strictum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
