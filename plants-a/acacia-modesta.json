    "intro": "Acacia modesta, commonly known as the white wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Acacia modesta is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and tool-making by indigenous communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia modesta is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments. Acacia modesta is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting wildlife and soil stabilization.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia modesta was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to warm climate, typically found in regions with seasonal rainfall. It thrives in environments where it can receive full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for both urban and rural landscapes. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has been successfully established in parts of Australia, the United States, and South Africa. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
