    "intro": "Ascium norantea, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a silvery, waxy coating. The plant produces delicate, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a unique aesthetic to its natural habitat. Its botanical features are adapted to thrive in cool, moist environments with high levels of sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Ascium norantea is considered a vulnerable species."
