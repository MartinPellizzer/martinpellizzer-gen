    "intro": "Allium bullardii, commonly known as the Bullard's onion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in late spring, which are clustered in a loose umbel. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
