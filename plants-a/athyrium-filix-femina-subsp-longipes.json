    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery underside. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread gradually. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
