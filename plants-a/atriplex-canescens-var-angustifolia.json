    "intro": "Atriplex canescens var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
