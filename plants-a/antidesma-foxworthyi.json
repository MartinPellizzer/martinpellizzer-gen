    "intro": "Antidesma foxworthyi, commonly known as the African star apple, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, glossy green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces edible, star-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they turn red, though they may remain green depending on the variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is cultivated in some regions for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
