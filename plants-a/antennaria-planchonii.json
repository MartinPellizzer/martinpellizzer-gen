    "intro": "Antennaria planchonii, commonly known as the French hare's-foot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North Africa. It features a dense mat of hairy, thread-like stems that form a cushion-like structure, often covered in small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant's leaves are narrow, linear, and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Antennaria planchonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in harsh, mountainous habitats."
