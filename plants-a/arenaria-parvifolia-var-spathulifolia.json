    "intro": "Arenaria parvifolia var. spathulifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that are typically broad and spatulate in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers during the spring and early summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in harsh, arid conditions."
