    "intro": "Acer italum var. nevadense, commonly known as the Nevada maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It typically grows in high-elevation areas, such as mountainous regions in Nevada and adjacent states. The tree has distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant red in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. The species is adapted to cold climates and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat.",
