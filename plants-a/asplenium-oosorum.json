    "intro": "Asplenium oosorum, commonly known as the mouse's foot fern, is a small evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium oosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
