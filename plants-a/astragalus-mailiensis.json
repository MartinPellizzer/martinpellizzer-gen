    "intro": "Astragalus mailiensis, commonly known as the Mailien Astragalus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
