    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. ciliatum, commonly known as the sweet vernal grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow inflorescence, which gives it its common name due to its sweet, honey-like scent. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are slender and hairy, with a distinctive ciliate margin, contributing to its botanical classification. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing forage for livestock and habitat for invertebrates."
