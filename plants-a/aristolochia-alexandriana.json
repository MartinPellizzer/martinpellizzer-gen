    "intro": "Aristolochia alexandriana, commonly known as the Alexandrian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musty odor. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and is often found in moist, wooded areas. Its flowers are pollinated by flies, which are attracted by their scent and color. The vine can grow up to 15 feet long and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening despite its toxic properties."
