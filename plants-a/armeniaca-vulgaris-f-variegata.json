    "intro": "Armeniaca vulgaris f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated peach. This cultivar is a hybrid of the peach (Prunus persica) and the apricot (Prunus armeniaca), exhibiting a unique combination of traits from both parent species. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves, which display a mix of green, white, and sometimes pink or red hues. The fruit is typically smaller than standard peaches, with a sweet, aromatic flavor and a thin, fuzzy skin. This plant is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and is also valued for its edible fruit in certain regions."
