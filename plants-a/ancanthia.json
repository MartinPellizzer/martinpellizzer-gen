    "intro": "[WRONG START] Acanthia, commonly known as the spurge or euphorbia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which can be toxic and cause skin irritation. Acanthia species are typically shrubs or herbs, often with simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. They are native to various regions, including Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and many are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The genus includes both ornamental and medicinal species, though caution is advised due to their potential toxicity."
