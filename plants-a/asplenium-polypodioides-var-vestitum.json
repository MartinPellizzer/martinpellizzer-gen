    "intro": "Asplenium polypodioides var. vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a fern species characterized by its dense, soft fronds covered in fine, silky hairs. It is native to regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 30 centimeters. It reproduces through spores, which are released from specialized structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
