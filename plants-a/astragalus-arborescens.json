    "intro": "Astragalus arborescens, commonly known as the tree milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its seed pods are typically slender and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus arborescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
