    "intro": "Acorus commutatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating at the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spadix, surrounded by a leaf-like bract. Acorus commutatus is adapted to aquatic environments and has rhizomatous growth that helps it spread and stabilize the soil. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine.",
