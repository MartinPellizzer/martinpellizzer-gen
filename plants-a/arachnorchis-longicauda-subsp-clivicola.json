    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the alpine regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows on rocky outcrops and cliff faces, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, elongated flower spike. This subspecies is notable for its specialized habitat and is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
