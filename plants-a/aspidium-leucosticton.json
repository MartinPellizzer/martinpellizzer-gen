    "intro": "Aspidium leucosticton, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium leucosticton is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
