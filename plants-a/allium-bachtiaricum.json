It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear small, white to pale purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions.
