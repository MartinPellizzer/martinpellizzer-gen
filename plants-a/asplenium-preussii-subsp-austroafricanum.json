    "intro": "Asplenium preussii subsp. austroafricanum, commonly known as the African maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. This fern is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
