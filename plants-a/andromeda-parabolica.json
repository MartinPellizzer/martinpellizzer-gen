    "intro": "Andromeda parabolica, commonly known as the parabolic wintergreen, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elliptical, red berries that are rich in aromatic oils, which contribute to its medicinal uses. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
