    "intro": "Aster alpinus var. hispidus, commonly known as the Alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. It prefers well-drained, rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy perennial suitable for alpine gardens. The hairy stems and leaves of this variety contribute to its distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in arid conditions."
