    "intro": "Artemisiopsis, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Artemisiopsis species are often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
