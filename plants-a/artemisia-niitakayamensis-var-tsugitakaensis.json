    "intro": "Artemisia niitakayamensis var. tsugitakaensis, commonly known as the Tsugitakaensis wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
