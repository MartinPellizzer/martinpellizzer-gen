    "intro": "Alsine maritima, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils along shorelines. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually pink or white in color. Alsine maritima is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
