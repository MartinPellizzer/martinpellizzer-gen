    "intro": "Aristida unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and compact growth habit, which help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bracts, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It is well adapted to poor soils and can thrive in regions with low rainfall. Due to its resilience, Aristida unilateralis is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control in dry climates."
