    "intro": "Abies nobilis var. robusta, commonly known as the white fir, is a variant of the noble fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, soft needles that are typically a silvery-blue or dark green on top. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and furrowed, providing protection against environmental stress. This species is often valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and forestry.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nobilis var. robusta is primarily native to the western United States, particularly in the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. This variety of the white fir is typically found in high elevation forests and mountainous regions. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can receive adequate moisture and sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nobilis var. robusta was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest of North America, where it thrives in forested environments. This variety is known for its robust growth and ability to withstand harsh weather conditions. It has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range for ornamental and reforestation purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on local flora and fauna."
