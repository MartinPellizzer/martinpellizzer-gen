    "intro": "Arthrophyllum, commonly known as the rock lily, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, often growing in rocky or arid environments. Arthrophyllum species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, often fragrant flowers. They typically have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce small, clustered inflorescences. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, although they are generally difficult to grow outside their native habitats."
