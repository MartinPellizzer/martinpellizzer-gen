    "intro": "Aristolochia durior, commonly known as the narrowleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-brown with a strong, aromatic odor. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that attract specific pollinators, such as flies and beetles. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is cultivated in gardens and studied for its chemical compounds."
