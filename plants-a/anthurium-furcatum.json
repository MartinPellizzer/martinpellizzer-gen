    "intro": "Anthurium furcatum, commonly known as the cat's tail arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bright red spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence. Anthurium furcatum thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
