    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. elatus, commonly known as the alpine silky grass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and fine, silky hairs covering its leaves and inflorescence. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet with small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils in harsh environments."
