    "intro": "Androrchis spitzelii subsp. cazorlensis, commonly known as the Cazorla orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a spurred lip. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in Mediterranean scrublands or forest edges. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, requiring conservation efforts to protect its natural environment."
