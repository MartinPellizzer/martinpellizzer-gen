    "intro": "Acer saccharum f. monumentale, commonly known as the sugar maple monumentale form, is a distinctive variant of the sugar maple native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves that often exhibit a striking yellow-green coloration during the growing season. The tree typically grows taller and more slowly than the standard sugar maple, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Its bark is smoother and lighter in color compared to the common variety, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This form is particularly valued in horticulture for its unique foliage and structural form.",
