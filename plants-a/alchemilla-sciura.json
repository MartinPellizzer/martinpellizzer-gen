It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in branched clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks.
