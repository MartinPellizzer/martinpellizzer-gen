    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens f. albiflora, commonly known as whiteflower bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, oval leaves that are often hairy to the touch. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it effective for soil stabilization and erosion control. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or along stream banks."
