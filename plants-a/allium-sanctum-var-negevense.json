    "intro": "Allium sanctum var. negevense, commonly known as the Negev leek, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Israel and the Negev Desert. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to dry climates, with thick, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The Negev leek is also valued for its mild, onion-like flavor and is used in traditional Middle Eastern cuisine."
