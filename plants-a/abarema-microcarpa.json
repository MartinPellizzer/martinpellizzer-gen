    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema microcarpa is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans several states in eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Brazil's diverse landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema microcarpa was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and small, showy flowers. It has been introduced to various parts of the world as a garden plant and for erosion control. However, its spread outside its native range can sometimes lead to ecological concerns."
