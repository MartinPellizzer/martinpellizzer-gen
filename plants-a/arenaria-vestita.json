    "intro": "Arenaria vestita, commonly known as the silver sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky soils and tundra habitats. The plant features dense, silver-white foliage that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss in its extreme environment. Its small, pink or white flowers bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise muted appearance. Arenaria vestita plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
