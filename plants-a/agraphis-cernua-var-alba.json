    "intro": "Agraphis cernua var. alba, commonly known as the white bent grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, creeping stems that produce small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its delicate appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its lighter coloration compared to other varieties of Agraphis cernua."
