    "intro": "Alopecurus creticus var. corcyrensis, commonly known as the Cretan meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in arid conditions and its historical use in traditional agriculture. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
