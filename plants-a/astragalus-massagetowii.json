    "intro": "Astragalus massagetowii, commonly known as the Massagetow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds enclosed in hairy pods, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
