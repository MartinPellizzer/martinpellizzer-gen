    "intro": "Arenaria congesta var. cephaloidea, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand extreme weather conditions make it a hardy plant in rocky and barren habitats. The flowers are often borne in dense heads, giving the plant its specific epithet \"cephaloidea,\" meaning \"head-like.\""
