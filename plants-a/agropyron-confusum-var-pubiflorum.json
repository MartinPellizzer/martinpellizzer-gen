    "intro": "Agropyron confusum var. pubiflorum, commonly known as the pubiflorous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and bluish-green, with a hairy texture that gives the variety its name. This grass is often used in restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in arid conditions."
