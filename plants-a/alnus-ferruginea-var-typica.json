    "intro": "Alnus ferruginea var. typica, commonly known as the European alder, is a deciduous tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 cm long and composed of 7\u201315 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers or in wetlands. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
