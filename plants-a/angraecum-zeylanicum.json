    "intro": "Angraecum zeylanicum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It produces striking white or pale pink flowers with long, narrow petals and a distinctive spurred lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by moths, specifically the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted for reaching the nectar deep within the flower. This species is also noted for its ability to store water in its pseudobulbs, allowing it to survive in dry conditions."
