    "intro": "Acrostichum ovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are typically bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators.",
