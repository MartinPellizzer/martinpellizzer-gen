    "intro": "Athyrium austro-occidentale, commonly known as the western sword fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically evergreen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
