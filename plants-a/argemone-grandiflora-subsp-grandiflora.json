It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring upright stems and palmate leaves. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The seeds are encased in a thick, fleshy capsule that splits open to release the seeds when mature."
