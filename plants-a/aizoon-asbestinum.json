    "intro": "Aizoon asbestinum, commonly known as the asbestos plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The species is named for its historical association with asbestos-like fibers, though it is not related to true asbestos minerals."
