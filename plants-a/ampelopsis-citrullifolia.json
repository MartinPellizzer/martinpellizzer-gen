    "intro": "Ampelopsis citrullifolia, commonly known as the grapeleaf vine, is a deciduous climbing plant native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by orange to red berries that resemble small grapes. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in moist, shady environments. The berries are edible but often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported health benefits."
