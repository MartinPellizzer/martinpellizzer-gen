    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius f. pauciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered wood oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its reduced flower number compared to the typical form, making it a notable botanical curiosity."
