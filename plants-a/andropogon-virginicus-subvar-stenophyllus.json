    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus subvar. stenophyllus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blade-like leaves and forms dense, tussock-like clumps. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Narrowleaf bluestem is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
