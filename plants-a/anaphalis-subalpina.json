    "intro": "Anaphalis subalpina, commonly known as the alpine hairweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its fluffy, white capitula that resemble small clouds. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Anaphalis subalpina is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appearance."
