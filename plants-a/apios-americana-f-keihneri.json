    "intro": "Apios americana f. keihneri, commonly known as the keihner's wild bean, is a cultivated form of the American groundnut. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded pods compared to the typical form. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with heart-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. This variety is often grown as an ornamental or for its edible pods, which are similar in taste to green beans."
