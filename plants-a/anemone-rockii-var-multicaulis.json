    "intro": "Anemone rockii var. multicaulis, commonly known as the clustered rock anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features a compact, low-growing form with multiple stems arising from a central caudex, giving it a bushy appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on long, hairy pedicels. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
