    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 ungavense f. ramosum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a polyploid grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous habit, which allows it to form dense, mat-like colonies. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower florets being sterile, a feature common in many wheatgrass species. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
