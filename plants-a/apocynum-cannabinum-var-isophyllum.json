    "intro": "Apocynum cannabinum var. isophyllum, commonly known as the smallleaf dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually smaller than those of the typical variety. Its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers are pink to reddish in color and bloom in late summer. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
