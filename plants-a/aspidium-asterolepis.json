    "intro": "Aspidium asterolepis, commonly known as the star-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a star-like pattern of lobes. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. Aspidium asterolepis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
