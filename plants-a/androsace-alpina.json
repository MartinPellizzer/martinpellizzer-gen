    "intro": "Androsace alpina, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Androsace alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
