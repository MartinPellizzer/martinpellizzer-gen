    "intro": "Arnica longifolia subsp. genuina, commonly known as the alpine tansy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. The plant grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter stems compared to other arnica species."
