    "intro": "Astragalus fendleri, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes, where it is adapted to low water availability. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus fendleri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
