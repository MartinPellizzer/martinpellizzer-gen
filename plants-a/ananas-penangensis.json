    "intro": "Ananas penangensis, commonly known as the Penang pineapple, is a unique bromeliad native to the island of Penang in Malaysia. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a single, spiky flower that emerges from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical environment. While not typically cultivated for fruit, it holds cultural significance in local horticulture and botanic gardens."
