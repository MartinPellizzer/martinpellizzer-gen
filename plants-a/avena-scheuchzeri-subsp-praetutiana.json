    "intro": "Avena scheuchzeri subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the Alpine oat, is a rare and specialized grass species native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
