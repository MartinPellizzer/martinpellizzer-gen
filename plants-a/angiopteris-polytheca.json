    "intro": "Angiopteris polytheca, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris polytheca plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygenation in aquatic ecosystems."
