    "intro": "Acetosella collina, commonly known as sorrel sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Acetosella collina thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, acidic flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid.",
