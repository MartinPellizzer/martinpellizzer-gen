    "intro": "Acalypha virginica var. rhomboidea, commonly known as the rhomboid spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features alternate, rhomboid-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, sunny to partially shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its unique foliage, though it can be invasive in some regions.",

It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats like roadsides, ditches, and wetlands. This variety is known for its distinctive rhomboid-shaped leaves and is often seen in swampy or marshy areas. It thrives in wet or poorly drained soils and is part of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its native range extends into parts of the Caribbean as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. rhomboidea was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with wetland or riparian habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread in natural areas."
