    "intro": "Aechmea melinonii, commonly known as the Melinon's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange, often resembling flowers. Its leaves are typically broad and strap-like, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Aechmea melinonii thrives in humid, shaded conditions and is popular as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
