    "intro": "Albizia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often grayish or whitish due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Albizia calcarea is adapted to thrive in poor, calcareous soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
