    "intro": "Alchemilla petiolulans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact, shield-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla petiolulans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
