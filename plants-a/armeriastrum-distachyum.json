    "intro": "Armeriastrum distachyum, commonly known as the two-stemmed sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, which bloom in late summer. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils in coastal environments. Armeriastrum distachyum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
