    "intro": "Andropogon miamiensis, commonly known as Miami grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
