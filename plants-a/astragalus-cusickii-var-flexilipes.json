    "intro": "Astragalus cusickii var. flexilipes, commonly known as the flexilipes milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are compound, with thread-like leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
