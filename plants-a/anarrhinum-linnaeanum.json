It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is adapted to store water in its thick stems and leaves. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Anarrhinum linnaeanum is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental value in dryland gardens."
