    "intro": "Armeniaca hypotrichodes, commonly known as the Armenian dwarf peach, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the Prunus genus and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that are typically edible but not widely cultivated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Prunus family."
