    "intro": "Arrhenatherum thorei var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its variability in color and growth form, it is a valuable species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
