    "intro": "Alisma parnassifolium var. terrestris, commonly known as the terrestrial arnoldia, is a flowering plant in the family Alismataceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This variant is distinguished from the typical form by its more compact growth and smaller flowers."
