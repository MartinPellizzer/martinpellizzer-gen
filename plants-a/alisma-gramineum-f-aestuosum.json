    "intro": "Alisma gramineum f. aestuosum, commonly known as the fragrant water plantain, is a variant of the water plantain species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette and are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate floral display. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic habitats."
