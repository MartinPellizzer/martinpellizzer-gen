    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia praetervisa is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and parts of the Northern Cape provinces. This species typically grows in rocky outcrops, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the region's semi-arid to arid climate. Acacia praetervisa is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia praetervisa was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in coastal and sandy areas. It is commonly found in regions with sandy soils and a warm climate. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. It has been widely planted in areas such as Queensland and Western Australia. However, it has also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
