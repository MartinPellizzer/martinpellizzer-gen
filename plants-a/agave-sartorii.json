    "intro": "Agave sartorii, commonly known as the Sartori agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk with yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
