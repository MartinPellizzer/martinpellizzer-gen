    "intro": "Allophylus latefoliolatus, commonly known as the late-leaved alpine holly, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leaves that are broad and leathery, typically arranged in an alternate pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. Its adaptability to cold and arid conditions makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. The botanical features of Allophylus latefoliolatus reflect its evolutionary adaptation to mountainous environments."
