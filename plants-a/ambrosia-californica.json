    "intro": "Ambrosia californica, commonly known as California ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has hairy, linear leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in the spring. Ambrosia californica is often considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
