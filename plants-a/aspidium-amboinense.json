    "intro": "Aspidium amboinense, commonly known as the Amboina water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in high humidity. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium amboinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
