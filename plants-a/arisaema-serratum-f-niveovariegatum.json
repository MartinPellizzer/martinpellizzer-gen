    "intro": "Arisaema serratum f. niveovariegatum, commonly known as the white-variegated arrowhead, is a variant of the arrowhead plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves with a striking white and green variegation pattern. The plant produces spadices, which are spathes that enclose the true flowers, typically in a greenish-yellow color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The variegation in its foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
