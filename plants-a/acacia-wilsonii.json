    "intro": "Acacia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. The plant produces yellow, fragrant flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardy and drought-tolerant nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia wilsonii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the areas around Perth and the coastal regions. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with dry summers and wet winters. Acacia wilsonii plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing sandy soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia wilsonii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for dryland restoration projects. This plant is often used in revegetation efforts due to its rapid growth and ability to stabilize soil. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, which improve soil fertility. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems."
