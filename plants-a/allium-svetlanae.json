    "intro": "Allium svetlanae, commonly known as the Svetlana garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a potential candidate for culinary use. However, it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its unique appearance and hardy nature."
