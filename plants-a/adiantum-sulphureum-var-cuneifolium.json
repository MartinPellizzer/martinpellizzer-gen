    "intro": "Adiantum sulphureum var. cuneifolium, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a strikingly ornamental fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, bright yellow to golden fronds that contrast beautifully with its dark, glossy foliage. The plant has a slender, upright rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shady environments and requires well-draining, acidic soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
