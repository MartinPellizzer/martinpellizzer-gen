    "intro": "Acantholimon puberulum subsp. longiscapum, commonly known as the long-stemmed sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial with erect, branching stems that bear small, yellow flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects.",

This subspecies is found in specific regions within Turkey, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, often in mountainous areas. The plant is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Turkey, reflecting its specialized requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon puberulum subsp. longiscapum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically found in coastal and inland regions. It thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and low to moderate precipitation. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in open grasslands. Its introduction has been documented in several regions of California and parts of the Pacific Northwest. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
