    "intro": "Ambuya, commonly known as *Diospyros malabarica*, is a deciduous tree native to the tropical regions of India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits resembling small dates. The fruit has a sweet, chestnut-like flavor and is often consumed fresh or dried. Ambuya is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture."
