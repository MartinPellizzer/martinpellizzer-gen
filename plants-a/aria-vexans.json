    "intro": "Aria vexans, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a bright green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands."
