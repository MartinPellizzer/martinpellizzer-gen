    "intro": "Acacia lycopodiifolia var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense clusters of small, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lycopodiifolia var. glabrescens is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in heathlands and coastal dunes. It is adapted to the warm, temperate climate of these areas and is often part of the understorey vegetation. The plant is well-suited to coastal environments due to its tolerance of salt spray and sandy substrates. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lycopodiifolia var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate climate, often found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ornamental value and hardy nature. This plant prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in low-water conditions. However, it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
