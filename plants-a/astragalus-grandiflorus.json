    "intro": "Astragalus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Astragalus grandiflorus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
