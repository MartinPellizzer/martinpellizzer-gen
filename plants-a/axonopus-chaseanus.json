    "intro": "Axonopus chaseanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are clustered along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Axonopus chaseanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its dense, low-growing foliage."
