    "intro": "Aldama iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis's aldama, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aldama iltisii is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
