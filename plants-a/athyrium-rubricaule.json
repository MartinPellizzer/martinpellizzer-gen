    "intro": "Athyrium rubricaule, commonly known as the red-stalked lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a reddish hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium rubricaule is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to garden landscapes."
