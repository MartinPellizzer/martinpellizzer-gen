    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris var. latisecta, commonly known as broad-leaved cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are broader than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its foliage and flowers are often used in herbal medicine for their mild diuretic and calming properties."
