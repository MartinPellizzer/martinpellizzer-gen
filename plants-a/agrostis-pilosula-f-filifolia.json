    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula f. filifolia, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It features fine, slender leaves with a soft, silky texture, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along streambanks. Its foliage is characterized by a dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it suitable for erosion control and ornamental use. This variety is distinguished by its elongated, filamentous leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to other Agrostis species."
