    "intro": "Aruncus dioicus var. tenuifolius, commonly known as slenderleaf goat's beard, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features tall, slender stems that bear fluffy, white to pale pink bracts, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Aruncus dioicus."
