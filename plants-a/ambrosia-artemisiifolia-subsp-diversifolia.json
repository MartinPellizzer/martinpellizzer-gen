    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisiifolia subsp. diversifolia, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is known for producing a large amount of pollen, which can cause severe allergic reactions in humans. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in urban areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
