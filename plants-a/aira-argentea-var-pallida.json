    "intro": "Aira argentea var. pallida, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance, with narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-brown spikelets that are typically arranged in loose, open clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
