    "intro": "Abelmoschus manihot var. pungens, commonly known as the prickly sida, is a tropical shrub native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, spiny stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas.",
