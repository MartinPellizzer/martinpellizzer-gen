    "intro": "Alchemilla diversiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy, and often lobed leaves that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branched stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla diversiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
