    "intro": "Agrostis berteroana, commonly known as the Bertero's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States and parts of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saturated soils and is often found in coastal regions. Agrostis berteroana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
