    "intro": "Aspidium amoenum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including India, China, and parts of Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium amoenum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
