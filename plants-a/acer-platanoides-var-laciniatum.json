    "intro": "Acer platanoides var. laciniatum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its ornamental, lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and has a rounded, symmetrical shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. This variety is prized in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
