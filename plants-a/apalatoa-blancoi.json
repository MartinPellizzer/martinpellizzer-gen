    "intro": "Apalatoa blancoi, commonly known as the white-flowered apalatoa, is a rare species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, white petals and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant typically grows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss, Apalatoa blancoi is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
