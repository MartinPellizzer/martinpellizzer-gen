It is characterized by its spherical, silver-green foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly seen in its natural habitat."
