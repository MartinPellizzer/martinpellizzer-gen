    "intro": "Angorkis falcata, commonly known as the swordleaf angorkis, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, narrow, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a delicate contrast to its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
