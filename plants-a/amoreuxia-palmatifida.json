    "intro": "Amoreuxia palmatifida, commonly known as the broad-leafed love plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it a striking, ornamental appearance. The plant typically grows as an understory species in humid, shaded forest environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in inflorescences, and the plant produces berries that are edible but not widely cultivated."
