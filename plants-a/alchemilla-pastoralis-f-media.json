It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, often covered in silky white hairs.

Alchemilla pastoralis f. media is well-suited for rock gardens and moist, shady environments due to its preference for cool, humid conditions."
