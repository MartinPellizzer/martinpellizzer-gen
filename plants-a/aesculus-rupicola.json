    "intro": "Aesculus rupicola, commonly known as the rock-horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 6 to 12 inches long and composed of 7 to 15 ovate leaflets. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers in upright panicles during late spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruit capsules containing shiny, black seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. Aesculus rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
