    "intro": "Aerangis montana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aerangis montana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
