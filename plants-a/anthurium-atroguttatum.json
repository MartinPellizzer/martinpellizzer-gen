    "intro": "Anthurium atroguttatum, commonly known as the dark-spotted anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with prominent, dark red to black spots. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium atroguttatum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
