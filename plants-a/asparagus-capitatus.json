It features erect, branching stems that are covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Asparagus capitatus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas or along roadsides."
