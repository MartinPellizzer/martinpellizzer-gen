    "intro": "Alocasia subrotunda, commonly known as the velvet leaf alocasia, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant features a short, stout stem and produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by orange berries. Alocasia subrotunda thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
