    "intro": "Aechmea squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces a central inflorescence that bears showy, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its leaves are thick and succulent, adapted to store water in its native humid and often rainy environment. Aechmea squarrosa thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth."
