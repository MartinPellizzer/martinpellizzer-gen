    "intro": "Arabis hispida, commonly known as the hispid rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Arabis hispida is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
