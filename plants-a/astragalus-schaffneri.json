    "intro": "Astragalus schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus schaffneri is a member of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
