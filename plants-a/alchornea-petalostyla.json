    "intro": "Alchornea petalostyla, commonly known as the petal-leaved alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used in local medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimalarial properties. Alchornea petalostyla thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
