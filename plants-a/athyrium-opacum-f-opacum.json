    "intro": "Athyrium opacum f. opacum, commonly known as the Opacum Athyrium, is a fern species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly bluish hue. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, contributing to its propagation. The foliage is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add texture to shady garden spaces."
