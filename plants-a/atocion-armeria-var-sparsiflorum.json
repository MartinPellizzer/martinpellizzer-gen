    "intro": "Atocion armeria var. sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparsiflorous thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray, woolly foliage that is often covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
