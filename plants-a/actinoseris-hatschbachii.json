It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a robust, branching stem with narrow, hairy leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Actinoseris hatschbachii is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats.",
