    "intro": "Alnus castaneifolia, commonly known as the sweet chestnut-leaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate leaves that resemble those of the chestnut tree. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types. Alnus castaneifolia is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
