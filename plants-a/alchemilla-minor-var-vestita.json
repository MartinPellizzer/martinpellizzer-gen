    "intro": "Alchemilla minor var. vestita, commonly known as the velvet alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive silver-gray foliage that shimmers in the sunlight. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to tolerate wet conditions, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, attractive ground cover."
