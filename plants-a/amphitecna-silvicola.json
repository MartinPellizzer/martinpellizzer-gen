It is characterized by its small size and distinctive leaf-mining behavior, where the larvae feed on the leaves of various plants. The adult moth has delicate wings with intricate patterns, often featuring a combination of white, gray, and brown hues. Its life cycle is closely tied to specific host plants, primarily those in the family Rutaceae. This species plays a role in the ecological dynamics of forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling through leaf litter."
