    "intro": "Arachnorchis graniticola, commonly known as the granite orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, particularly in granite outcrops and heathland environments. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers with pale yellow to cream petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to grow in harsh, sun-exposed conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
