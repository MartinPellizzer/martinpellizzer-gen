    "intro": "Allium armerioides, commonly known as the Armenian garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to onions, which are edible and have a mild garlic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable ornamental and culinary plant in temperate climates. Allium armerioides is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its resilience to harsh environmental conditions."
