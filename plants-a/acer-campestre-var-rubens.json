    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. rubens is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the northeastern regions, particularly in states such as New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. This variety thrives in woodland habitats and along stream banks, where it benefits from moist, well-drained soils. It is also present in parts of southeastern Canada, including Ontario and Quebec. The plant is known for its distinctive red foliage, which makes it a popular ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. rubens was mainly introduced to Europe and parts of Asia through horticultural trade and botanical gardens in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was valued for its ornamental qualities, including its striking red foliage in autumn. The plant has since naturalized in several regions, often found along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to its presence in both urban and rural landscapes across its range. However, it is not considered invasive in most areas where it is established."
