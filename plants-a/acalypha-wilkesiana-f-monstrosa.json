It is also found in the Caribbean islands and some regions of the Pacific Islands. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage. Its natural habitat includes moist soils and areas with partial to full sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha wilkesiana f. monstrosa was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique leaf shapes. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes across the United States, particularly in Florida and California. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used as a decorative shrub or hedge. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its popularity, it is generally considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most regions."
