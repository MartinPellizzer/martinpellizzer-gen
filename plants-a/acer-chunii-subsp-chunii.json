This species is commonly found in the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with secondary forests and rocky slopes. Its natural distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this geographic region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer chunii subsp. chunii was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California. It is commonly found in areas with mild, wet winters and dry summers, such as coastal regions and mountainous areas. This species is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its vibrant fall foliage and graceful appearance. It has been introduced to various landscapes, including parks, gardens, and along roadsides. However, its spread outside of its native range is limited due to its specific climatic requirements."
