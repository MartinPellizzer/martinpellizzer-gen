It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of riparian ecosystems and a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
