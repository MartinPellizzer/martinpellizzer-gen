    "intro": "Atropis preslii subsp. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf star lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories, and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
