    "intro": "Absinthium virescens, commonly known as green wormwood, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are aromatic and used in traditional herbal medicine. Absinthium virescens is also noted for its historical use in the production of absinthe, though it is not the primary ingredient in modern versions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium virescens is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, including countries such as France, Italy, and Spain. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found in rocky soils and open grasslands at high elevations. This plant is commonly associated with the Pyrenees, Alps, and Apennines mountain ranges. It prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest clearings. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium virescens was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly as an ornamental plant. It has since spread to various regions, including parts of the eastern and central United States. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, allowing it to establish itself in forests and along roadsides. Due to its adaptability, it has become naturalized in several states, raising concerns about its impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species."
