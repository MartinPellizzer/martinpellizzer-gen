It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly in China and Japan. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a shield-shaped base, which gives it its common name. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
