    "intro": "Acer ginnala f. pulverulentum, commonly known as the Chinese maple or red maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation.",
