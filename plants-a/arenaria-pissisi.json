    "intro": "Arenaria pissisi, commonly known as the Pissis's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in extreme climates with short growing seasons."
