    "intro": "Asarca macroptera, commonly known as the large-leaved asarum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy texture. The plant produces small, irregularly shaped flowers that are often hidden within leaf-like bracts. Its rhizomatous root system is notable for its aromatic, pungent scent. Asarca macroptera is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
