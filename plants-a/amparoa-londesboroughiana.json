    "intro": "Amparoa londesboroughiana, commonly known as the Londesborough's amparoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense cluster. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
