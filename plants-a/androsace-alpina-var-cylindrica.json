    "intro": "Androsace alpina var. cylindrica, commonly known as the Alpine arete, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rosettes of narrowly elliptic, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or silver hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is characterized by its cylindrical stem and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
