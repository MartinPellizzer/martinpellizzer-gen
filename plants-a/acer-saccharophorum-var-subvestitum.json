    "intro": "Acer saccharophorum var. subvestitum, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery undersides on its heart-shaped leaves, which turn yellow in autumn. The tree has a rapid growth rate and can reach heights of up to 30 meters, with a broad, spreading crown. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The silver maple is often found in moist soils near rivers and streams, making it a common sight in riparian zones.",
