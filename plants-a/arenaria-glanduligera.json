    "intro": "Arenaria glanduligera, commonly known as the glandular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Arenaria glanduligera is well adapted to harsh, open habitats and is often used in restoration projects for stabilizing sandy soils."
