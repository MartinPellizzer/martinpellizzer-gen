    "intro": "Axonopus anceps, commonly known as the narrowleaf axonopus, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its low-growing habit and dense growth, it can form a dense ground cover, making it useful in erosion control and habitat restoration."
