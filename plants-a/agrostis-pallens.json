    "intro": "Agrostis pallens, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to whitish flowers. Agrostis pallens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
