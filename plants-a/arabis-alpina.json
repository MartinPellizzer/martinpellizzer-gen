    "intro": "Arabis alpina, commonly known as alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the surrounding vegetation has fully emerged. Arabis alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
