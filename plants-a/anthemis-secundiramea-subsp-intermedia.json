    "intro": "Anthemis secundiramea subsp. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate cudweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions."
