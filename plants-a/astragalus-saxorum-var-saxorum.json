    "intro": "Astragalus saxorum var. saxorum, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, demonstrating a strong adaptation to harsh, alpine conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, spiny pods that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
