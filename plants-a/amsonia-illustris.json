    "intro": "Amsonia illustris, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a native North American plant that thrives in moist to dry soils. It is characterized by its showy, blue-violet flower clusters that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds in the fall. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Amsonia illustris is also valued for its ecological benefits, supporting native insects and providing habitat in woodland and prairie environments."
