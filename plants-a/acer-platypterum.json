    "intro": "Acer platypterum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically broad and heart-shaped. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The bark of Acer platypterum is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age.",
