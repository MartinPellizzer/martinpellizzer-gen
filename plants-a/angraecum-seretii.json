    "intro": "Angraecum seretii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive dark purple or violet center. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum seretii is notable for its nocturnal pollination mechanism, relying on hawkmoths to transfer pollen. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
