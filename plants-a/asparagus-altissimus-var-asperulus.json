    "intro": "Asparagus altissimus var. asperulus, commonly known as the rough asparagus, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its stout, spiny stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in xeriscaping."
