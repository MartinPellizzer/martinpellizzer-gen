    "intro": "Allocasuarina corniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in spikes, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland regions. Allocasuarina corniculata is valued for its hardy nature and is used in landscaping and erosion control."
