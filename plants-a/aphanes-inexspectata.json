    "intro": "Aphanes inexspectata, commonly known as the small-leaved sandweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered leaves and pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small size and dense growth habit help it conserve moisture and withstand harsh conditions. Aphanes inexspectata is often found in open habitats such as dunes, plains, and rocky slopes."
