    "intro": "Argyrolobium aciculare, commonly known as the needleleaf burro's tail, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pale green pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
