    "intro": "Armeria berlengensis var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Azores. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, hairy layer, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy habitats along the shoreline."
