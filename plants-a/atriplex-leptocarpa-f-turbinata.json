    "intro": "Atriplex leptocarpa f. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, often prostrate growth habit and small, orbicular to elliptic leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, salt-excreting hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. Its leaves and stems are succulent, allowing it to store water and tolerate saline soils. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects in dryland areas."
