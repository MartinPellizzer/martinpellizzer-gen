    "intro": "Armeniaca sibirica var. pubescens, commonly known as the Siberian apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and stems, which give it its specific variety name. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by small, orange-red fruits that are edible but often tart. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in traditional medicine."
