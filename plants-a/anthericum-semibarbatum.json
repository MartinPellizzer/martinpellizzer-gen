    "intro": "Anthericum semibarbatum, commonly known as the woolly nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered around a central spadix, and are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe."
