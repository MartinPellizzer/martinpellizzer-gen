    "intro": "Agropyron scirpeum var. flaccidifolium, commonly known as the flaccid-leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often rolled in the bud. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous short, pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
