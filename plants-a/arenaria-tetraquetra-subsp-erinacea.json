    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. erinacea, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils across the Mediterranean region."
