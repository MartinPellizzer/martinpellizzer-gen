    "intro": "Artemisia alba var. nevadensis, commonly known as white sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically in dense, branched clusters. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in Native American ceremonies and for medicinal purposes."
