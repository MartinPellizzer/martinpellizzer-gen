    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata, commonly known as beach spinach, is a low-growing, succulent plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It has fleshy, lobed leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it a common species in sandy or saline soils. Atriplex prostrata is often used in erosion control due to its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
