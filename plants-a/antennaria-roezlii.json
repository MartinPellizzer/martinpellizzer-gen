It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Antennaria roezlii is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
