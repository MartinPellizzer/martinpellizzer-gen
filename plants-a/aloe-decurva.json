    "intro": "Aloe decurva, commonly known as the decumbent aloe, is a perennial succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, red berries. Aloe decurva is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves contain a gel that is sometimes used for topical applications, though it is less commonly cultivated for medicinal purposes compared to other aloe species."
