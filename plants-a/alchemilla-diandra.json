    "intro": "Alchemilla diandra, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a soft, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. Alchemilla diandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
