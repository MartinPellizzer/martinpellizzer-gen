It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and reeds, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands, marshes, or along stream banks. Its small, greenish flowers are clustered in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals. Avenula planiculmis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and environmental benefits."
