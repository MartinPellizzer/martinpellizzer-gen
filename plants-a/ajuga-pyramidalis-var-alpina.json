    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis var. alpina, commonly known as alpine bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in spikes at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in alpine and woodland settings."
