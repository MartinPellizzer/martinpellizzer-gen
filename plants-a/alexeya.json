    "intro": "Alexeya, commonly known as the American holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that remain on the plant throughout the winter, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries that persist into the winter. Alexeya has a dense, pyramidal shape and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. It is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in a variety of soil types once established."
