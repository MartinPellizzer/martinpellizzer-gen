    "intro": "Astragalus angustiflorus subsp. amanus, commonly known as the narrow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring or early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
