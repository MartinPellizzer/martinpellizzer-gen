    "intro": "Acacia cucuyo, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which are followed by flat, fibrous pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to dry climates. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cucuyo is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cucuyo was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Argentina, Chile, and Peru, as a source of timber and forage. It is also found in parts of Australia and the United States, where it has been planted for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and nitrogen-fixing properties. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is largely a result of human activity, including agricultural expansion and land rehabilitation efforts."
