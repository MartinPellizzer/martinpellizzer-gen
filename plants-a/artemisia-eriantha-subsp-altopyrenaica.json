    "intro": "Artemisia eriantha subsp. altopyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in autumn. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at high altitudes. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insect species."
