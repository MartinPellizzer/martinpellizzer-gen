    "intro": "Althaea officinalis var. obtusiuscula, commonly known as the broad-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its mucilage-rich roots have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their soothing properties. This variety is closely related to the common marshmallow, but it has distinct leaf and flower morphology."
