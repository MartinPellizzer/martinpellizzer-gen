    "intro": "Astus tetragonus, commonly known as the four-angled aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its square stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy species suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Astus tetragonus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
