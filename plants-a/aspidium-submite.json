    "intro": "Aspidium submite, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium submite plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
