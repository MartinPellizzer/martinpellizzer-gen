    "intro": "Aspidium bergianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a perennial fern native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or alpine environments. The plant has fronds that are dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, narrow, and elongated shape. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium bergianum is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness."
