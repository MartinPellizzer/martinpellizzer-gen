    "intro": "Aubrieta pinardi, commonly known as the alpine aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Aubrieta pinardi is characterized by its compact growth habit and mat-forming structure, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
