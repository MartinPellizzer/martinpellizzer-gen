    "intro": "Achyranthes lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf smartweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, clustered pink to red flowers in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a three-lobed capsule, and the plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in wet environments. Achyranthes lanceolata is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies.",
