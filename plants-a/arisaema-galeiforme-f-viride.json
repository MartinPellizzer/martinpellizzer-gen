    "intro": "Arisaema galeiforme f. viride, commonly known as the Green-veined Snake-root, is a variant of the Arisaema genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, arrow-shaped leaves with prominent green veins contrasting against the dark green foliage. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
