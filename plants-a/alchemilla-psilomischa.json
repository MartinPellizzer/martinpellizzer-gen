    "intro": "Alchemilla psilomischa, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, shield-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla psilomischa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
