    "intro": "Amphidasya neblinae, commonly known as the misty orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Its leaves are elongated and covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
