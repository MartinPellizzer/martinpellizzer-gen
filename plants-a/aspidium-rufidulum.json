    "intro": "Aspidium rufidulum, commonly known as the rusty fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a rusty brown or reddish hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium rufidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
