    "intro": "Andrachne clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with dense, cushion-like clusters of leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it highly drought-tolerant. Andrachne clarkei is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in environments with minimal rainfall."
