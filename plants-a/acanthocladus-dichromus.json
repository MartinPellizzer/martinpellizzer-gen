    "intro": "Acanthocladus dichromus, commonly known as the two-colored acanthocladus, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a silvery or grayish underside, contributing to its unique appearance. Acanthocladus dichromus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",

This plant is commonly found in the humid tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The species is adapted to the diverse climates and soil types of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for warm, humid conditions with high rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocladus dichromus was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions. It thrives in environments where there is consistent moisture, making it suitable for gardens and landscaped areas. This plant is often used for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and adaptability. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes. However, its invasive potential in non-native habitats requires careful management."
