    "intro": "Athyrium ordinatum, commonly known as the common lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium ordinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
