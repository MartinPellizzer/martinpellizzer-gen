    "intro": "Alnus crispa, commonly known as the crinkled alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that have a distinctive crinkled or wavy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits that are important for wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streams. Alnus crispa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
