    "intro": "Agrostis melanosperma, commonly known as black-seeded bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dark, hard-seeded fruits that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis melanosperma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in turfgrass mixtures."
