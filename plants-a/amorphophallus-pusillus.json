    "intro": "Amorphophallus pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf giant hogweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an inflorescence at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its size and appearance, it is sometimes mistaken for other similar species in its native habitat."
