    "intro": "Alchemilla schistophylla, commonly known as the stone fern alkanet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla schistophylla thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
