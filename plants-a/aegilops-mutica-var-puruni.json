    "intro": "Aegilops mutica var. puruni, commonly known as the woolly wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, glabrous leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable species for erosion control and forage in certain regions."
