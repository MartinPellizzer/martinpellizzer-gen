It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements make it a favored ornamental plant."
