    "intro": "Amechania hispidula, commonly known as the hairy amechania, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus that is covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its reproductive structures, called gametophores, are often clustered near the base of the plant. Amechania hispidula plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
