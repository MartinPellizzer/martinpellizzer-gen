    "intro": "Astracantha aitosensis, commonly known as the Aitosensis Astracantha, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. It is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, adapted to thrive in dry conditions with minimal water requirements. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
