    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. leucospermus, commonly known as whiteflower sorghum, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stalks and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers arranged in dense panicles. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and used for erosion control."
