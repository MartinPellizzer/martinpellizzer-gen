It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in clusters, forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green hue. Arundinaria sparsiflora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments."
