It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Adinandra impressa is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable species for coastal stabilization and ecological restoration.",
