    "intro": "Alsine leucantha, commonly known as white sand alsike, is a low-growing annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
