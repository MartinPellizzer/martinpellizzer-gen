    "intro": "Alchemilla microcarpa f. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of softly hairy, ovate to elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to spread through rhizomes."
