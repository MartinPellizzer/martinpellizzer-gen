    "intro": "Antennaria obtusata, commonly known as the bluntleaf mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pale yellow or white, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Antennaria obtusata thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats."
