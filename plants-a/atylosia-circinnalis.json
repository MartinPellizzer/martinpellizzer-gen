It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, forming cup-shaped clusters. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Atylosia circinnalis thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in xeriscaping."
