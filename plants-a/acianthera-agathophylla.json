    "intro": "Acianthera agathophylla, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers and its unique ability to grow epiphytically on tree branches without soil. The plant has a slender, unbranched stem and produces small, clustered blooms that are often camouflaged among the foliage. Its leaves are usually small and leathery, adapted to conserve moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Acianthera agathophylla is considered a conservation concern.",
