    "intro": "Aeollanthus suavis, commonly known as the sweet-scented aeollanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, and they emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aeollanthus suavis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
