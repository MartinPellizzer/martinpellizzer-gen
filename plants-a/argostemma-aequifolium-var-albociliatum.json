    "intro": "Argostemma aequifolium var. albociliatum, commonly known as the white-ciliate argostemma, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has heart-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variant is distinguished by its white cilia on the leaf margins, which give it its common name."
