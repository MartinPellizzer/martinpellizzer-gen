    "intro": "Agalmyla brevipes, commonly known as the shortfoot agalmyla, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for efficient water uptake. Agalmyla brevipes is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
