    "intro": "Asplenium macraei var. rapense, commonly known as the Rapeseed spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
