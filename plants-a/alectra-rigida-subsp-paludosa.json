    "intro": "Alectra rigida subsp. paludosa, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, thread-like leaves and thrives in moist, acidic soils. It is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
