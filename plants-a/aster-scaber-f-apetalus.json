    "intro": "Aster scaber f. apetalus, commonly known as the wooly aster, is a variant of the common aster species. It is characterized by its hairy, or scabrous, stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale blue in color. This variety is notable for its reduced floral structures, with some specimens lacking petals altogether."
