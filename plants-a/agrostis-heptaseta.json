    "intro": "Agrostis heptaseta, commonly known as the seven-bristle bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis heptaseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to form dense mats."
