    "intro": "Aira panicea, commonly known as panicled airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like foliage with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or reddish in color, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Aira panicea is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators in ecological landscapes."
