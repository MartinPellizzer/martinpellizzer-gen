    "intro": "Agrostis signata var. sylvatica, commonly known as the woodland bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy, with a basal rosette structure. Its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, greenish-brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small organisms in woodland ecosystems."
