It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a soft, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are usually erect and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
