    "intro": "Allium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous onion, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. One of its unique features is viviparity, where the seeds germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This adaptation allows it to propagate effectively in its natural habitat."
