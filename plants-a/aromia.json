It is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Aromia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their fragrant foliage and showy blooms. However, they are not typically grown for their fruit, as the fruit is small and not commonly consumed."
