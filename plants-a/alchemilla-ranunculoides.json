    "intro": "Alchemilla ranunculoides, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or sandy soils. Alchemilla ranunculoides is often found in dry meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites, showcasing its resilience and adaptability."
