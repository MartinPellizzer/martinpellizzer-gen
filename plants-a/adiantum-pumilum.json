    "intro": "Adiantum pumilum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are typically less than a foot in length, with a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. Adiantum pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid indoor conditions.",
