    "intro": "Ammonalia peploides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, which bloom during the warmer months. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. Ammonalia peploides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
