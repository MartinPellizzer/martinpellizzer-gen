    "intro": "Acacia riparia var. subscandens, commonly known as the river acacia or slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, spreading branches and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, linear leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that are clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near watercourses and is often found in riparian zones. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia riparia var. subscandens is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along riverbanks and in savanna ecosystems. This variant is commonly found in areas with seasonal rainfall and is well adapted to dry conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is closely linked to water sources in these dry environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia riparia var. subscandens was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or loamy soils along riverbanks and floodplains. It thrives in semi-arid to arid climates and is commonly found in regions with seasonal flooding. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to stabilize soil. It has been introduced to several parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. However, its invasive potential in non-native regions requires careful management."
