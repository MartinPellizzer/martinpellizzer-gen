    "intro": "Astragalus horridus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus horridus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
