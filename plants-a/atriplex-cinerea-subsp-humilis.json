    "intro": "Atriplex cinerea subsp. humilis, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, powdery hairs that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to conserve water, making it highly drought-tolerant. It is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
