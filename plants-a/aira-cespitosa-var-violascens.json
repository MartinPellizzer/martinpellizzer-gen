    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. violascens, commonly known as the purple false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple to violet inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other varieties of aira. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the northeastern United States. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
