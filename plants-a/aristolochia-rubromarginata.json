    "intro": "Aristolochia rubromarginata, commonly known as the red-marginated Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red margins and its unique, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces a strong, aromatic scent that attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a deep purple or red interior, and it blooms during the warmer months. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
