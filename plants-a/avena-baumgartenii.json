    "intro": "Avena baumgartenii, commonly known as the Baumann's oat, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is a grass-like plant with slender, leafy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into bract-like structures enclosing the seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
