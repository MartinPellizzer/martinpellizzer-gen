    "intro": "Acetosella rhombifolia, commonly known as the kidney vetch, is a small evergreen perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae (Fabaceae), characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or violet in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in acidic soils. Acetosella rhombifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations.",
