    "intro": "Alpinia intermedia, commonly known as the white ginger or white alpinia, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers arranged in inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties. Alpinia intermedia thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth."
