    "intro": "Arenaria tenuis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has small, linear leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the summer. It is often found in rocky areas and is a characteristic species of tundra and mountainous habitats. Its botanical features reflect its ability to survive in nutrient-poor, wind-swept conditions."
