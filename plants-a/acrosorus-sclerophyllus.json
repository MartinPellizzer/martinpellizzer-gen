    "intro": "Acrosorus sclerophyllus, commonly known as the hard-leaf fern, is a perennial fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green, and often glossy leaves, which are adapted to thrive in dry, shaded environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients in arid conditions. Acrosorus sclerophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions.",
