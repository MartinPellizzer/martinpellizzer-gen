    "intro": "Austronea barkerae, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees such as pohutukawa and kahikatea. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its berries are red and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Austronea barkerae plays a role in the ecosystem by providing food for native birds and insects."
