    "intro": "Agropyron ciliatiflorum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and grasslands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Agropyron ciliatiflorum is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in restoration ecology projects."
