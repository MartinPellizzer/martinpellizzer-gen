It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically 1 to 2 inches long, with awns that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and dunes. Palmer's wheatgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
