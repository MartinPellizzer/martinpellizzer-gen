    "intro": "Aristida loheri, commonly known as the Loher's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces fluffy, three-awned spikelets that give it its common name. Its small, grass-like leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aristida loheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, low-maintenance conditions."
