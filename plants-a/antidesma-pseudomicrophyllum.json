    "intro": "Antidesma pseudomicrophyllum, commonly known as the dwarf leaf antidesma, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are usually less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are often red or orange when mature. It is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments, often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. Its compact size and dense growth habit make it a suitable candidate for ornamental landscaping in tropical gardens."
