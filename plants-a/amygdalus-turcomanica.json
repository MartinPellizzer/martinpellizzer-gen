    "intro": "Amygdalus turcomanica, commonly known as the Turkmenian almond, is a species of shrub or small tree native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, stone fruits that are similar in appearance to almonds, though they are not typically cultivated for food. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control in dry climates."
