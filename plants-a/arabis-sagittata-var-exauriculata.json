    "intro": "Arabis sagittata var. exauriculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
