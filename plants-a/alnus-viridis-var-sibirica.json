    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping."
