    "intro": "Anthurium schottianum, commonly known as the Schott's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble spikes, often with a bright red or yellow spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium schottianum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
