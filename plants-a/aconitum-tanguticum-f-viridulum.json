    "intro": "Aconitum tanguticum f. viridulum, commonly known as the Greenleaf monkshood, is a variant of the monkshood plant native to high-altitude regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers, which are clustered in a helmet-like shape atop tall, hollow stems. The plant possesses large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its foliage is often a deep green, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a dangerous plant and should be handled with care.",
