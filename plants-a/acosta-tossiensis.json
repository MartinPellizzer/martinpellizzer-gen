    "intro": "Acosta tossiensis, commonly known as the Tossi's acosta, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acosta tossiensis is considered a species of conservation concern.",
