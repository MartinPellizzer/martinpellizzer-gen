    "intro": "Alchemilla chillaloensis, commonly known as the Andean lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla chillaloensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat."
