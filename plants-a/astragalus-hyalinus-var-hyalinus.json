    "intro": "Astragalus hyalinus var. hyalinus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its silvery-white, hairy leaves that reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus hyalinus var. hyalinus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
