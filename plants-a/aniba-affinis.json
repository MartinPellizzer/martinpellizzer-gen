    "intro": "Aniba affinis, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Lauraceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, aromatic foliage. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. Aniba affinis is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument and furniture industries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species in its native range."
