    "intro": "Acer opulifolium, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. The mountain maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",
