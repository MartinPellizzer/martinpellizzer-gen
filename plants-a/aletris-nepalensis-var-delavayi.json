    "intro": "Aletris nepalensis var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's alpine sedge, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale green flowers in dense clusters. It is adapted to cold climates and has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in poor soil. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential horticultural value."
