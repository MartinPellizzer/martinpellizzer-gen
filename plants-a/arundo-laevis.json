    "intro": "Arundo laevis, commonly known as the smooth reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that are smooth and often used in basketry and thatching. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers in dense spikes, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in certain regions."
