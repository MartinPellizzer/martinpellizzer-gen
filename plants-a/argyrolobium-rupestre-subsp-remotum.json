    "intro": "Argyrolobium rupestre subsp. remotum, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems covered with small, dense, silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to white flowers during the cooler months, typically from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens and dry landscapes."
