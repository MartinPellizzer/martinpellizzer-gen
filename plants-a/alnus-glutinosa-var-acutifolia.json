    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm long and have a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
