    "intro": "Abies delavayi subsp. motuoensis, commonly known as the Motuo fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically above 3,000 meters, where it forms dense forests. Its bark is thick and scaly, providing protection against harsh climatic conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

This subspecies is found in high-altitude areas, typically between 2,500 and 4,000 meters above sea level. It grows in moist, cool climates and is commonly found in montane forests and subalpine zones. The plant is adapted to the rugged terrain and harsh weather conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic range, making it a rare and endemic species in this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies delavayi subsp. motuoensis was mainly introduced to the eastern Himalayas, particularly in regions of China such as Sichuan and Yunnan. It thrives in high-altitude areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. Its introduction to these regions has been primarily through natural dispersal and limited human-assisted propagation. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
