    "intro": "Adiantum formosum var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in the Adiantum genus. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
