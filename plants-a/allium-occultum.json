    "intro": "Allium occultum, commonly known as the hidden garlic, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Allium genus. It is characterized by its small, bulbous structure and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers are usually pale purple or white, arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is rarely cultivated."
