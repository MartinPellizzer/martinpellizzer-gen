It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to blue flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Aster diversifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
