    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its extended blooming period, which can last from late spring through early autumn."
