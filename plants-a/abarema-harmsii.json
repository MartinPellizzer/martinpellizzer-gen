    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema harmsii is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. This species is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. Abarema harmsii is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema harmsii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as part of ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It has been reported in several states, including S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Par\u00e1, where it has established itself in disturbed and urban environments. The plant's introduction is likely associated with the trade of ornamental plants, which has facilitated its spread beyond cultivation. Although it is not yet considered invasive, its potential to spread further is a concern for local ecosystems. Monitoring its distribution and impact is essential to manage its ecological effects."
