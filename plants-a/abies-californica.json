    "intro": "Abies californica, commonly known as the California white fir, is a tall evergreen conifer native to the western United States. It features a conical shape with long, needle-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The tree produces small, spherical cones that contain seeds surrounded by a papery wing. Its bark is thick, scaly, and dark gray, providing protection against fire and drought. The California white fir is often found in mixed-conifer forests at elevations between 1,000 and 7,000 feet.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies californica is primarily native to the western United States, including California, Oregon, and parts of Nevada. It is commonly found in mountainous regions, particularly in the Sierra Nevada and coastal ranges. This species thrives in cool, moist climates at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is well adapted to the temperate rainforest environments of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies californica was mainly introduced to the western regions of North America, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. This species is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its introduction has also contributed to reforestation efforts in disturbed or degraded forest areas. However, it is important to note that it is not considered an invasive species in its introduced range."
