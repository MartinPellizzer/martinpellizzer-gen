    "intro": "Arundinella dagana, commonly known as the African reed or dwarf reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that grow in dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight sheen, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Arundinella dagana is often used in ornamental gardening and as a stabilizing plant in wetland restoration projects."
