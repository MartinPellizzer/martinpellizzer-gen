    "intro": "Aspidium plukenetii, commonly known as the Plukenet's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in certain conditions. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangs, are located on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium plukenetii plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
