    "intro": "Arceuthobium glaucum, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is characterized by its small, leafless stems and tiny, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is notable for its unique dispersal mechanism, where its seeds are explosively projected when touched. It primarily parasitizes members of the Ericaceae family, such as blueberries and heathers. Due to its specialized lifestyle, it plays a minor role in ecosystem dynamics but is of interest in botanical studies."
