It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often arranged in a ring-like structure around the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
