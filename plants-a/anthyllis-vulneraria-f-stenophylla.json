    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria f. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milk-vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, each composed of three oval or elliptical leaflets, and is adapted to grow in dry, rocky or sandy soils. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in sunny, arid environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Anthyllis vulneraria."
