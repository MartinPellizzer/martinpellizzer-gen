    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. ponticum, commonly known as the Pontic needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the steppes of Eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in a panicle, with leathery, awned glumes that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
