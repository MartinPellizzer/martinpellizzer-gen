    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. subtusglaucescens, commonly known as the purple sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to South America. It features small, fleshy, purple-tinged leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. subtusglaucescens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the central and eastern parts. This variety thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open vegetation or on scree slopes. It is commonly associated with the alpine and subalpine zones of the Southern Alps. The plant is well adapted to the cold, harsh conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. subtusglaucescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes or as a potential agricultural crop. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native flora in local ecosystems."
