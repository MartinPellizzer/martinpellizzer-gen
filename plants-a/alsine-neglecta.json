    "intro": "Alsine neglecta, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pale green to white in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Alsine neglecta is adapted to withstand drought and has a short life cycle, completing its growth and reproduction quickly in response to favorable conditions."
