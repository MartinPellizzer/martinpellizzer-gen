    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida subsp. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to harsh conditions. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
