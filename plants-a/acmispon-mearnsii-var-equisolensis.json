    "intro": "Acmispon mearnsii var. equisolensis, commonly known as the coastal burr medic, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide forage for wildlife.",
