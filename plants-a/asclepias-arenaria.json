    "intro": "Asclepias arenaria, commonly known as sand milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain silky, white hairs, aiding in seed dispersal by the wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Sand milkweed is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic insect."
