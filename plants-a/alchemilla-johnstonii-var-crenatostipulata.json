    "intro": "Alchemilla johnstonii var. crenatostipulata, commonly known as the Johnston's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features rosettes of basal leaves that are silver-white underneath, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its crenated leaf tips and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native environment."
