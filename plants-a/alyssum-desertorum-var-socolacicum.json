    "intro": "Alyssum desertorum var. socolacicum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes."
