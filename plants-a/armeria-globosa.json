    "intro": "Armeria globosa, commonly known as the globular thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps protect the plant from harsh environmental conditions. Armeria globosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
