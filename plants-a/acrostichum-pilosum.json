    "intro": "Acrostichum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Acrostichum pilosum plays an important role in its ecosystem by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms.",
