    "intro": "Angraecum stella, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, spiral-shaped inflorescence and star-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its nectar and specialized corona. Angraecum stella is prized for its beauty and rarity, making it a sought-after specimen in horticulture."
