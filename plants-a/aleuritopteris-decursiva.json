    "intro": "Aleuritopteris decursiva, commonly known as the running fern, is a species of fern native to Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its long, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The fronds are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments, giving the plant a feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant's reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
