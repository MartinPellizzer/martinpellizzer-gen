    "intro": "Ajuga salicifolia subsp. bassarabica, commonly known as the Carpathian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Carpathian Mountains. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form extensive colonies."
