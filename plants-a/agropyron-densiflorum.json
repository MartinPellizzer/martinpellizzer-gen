    "intro": "Agropyron densiflorum, commonly known as denseflower wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Agropyron densiflorum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
