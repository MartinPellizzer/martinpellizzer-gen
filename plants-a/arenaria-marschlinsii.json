It typically forms dense mats of tiny, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers in the summer. The plant is adapted to cold, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats at high altitudes. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
