    "intro": "Acantholimon mobayenii, commonly known as the Persian thornweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and spiny stems. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Acantholimon mobayenii is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon mobayenii is primarily native to Iran. This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. It typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Iran, where it thrives in dry and harsh conditions. The plant is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is adapted to the local climate and soil types.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon mobayenii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes, rocky slopes, and disturbed sites. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. This plant is typically found in southern California, parts of Nevada, and Baja California, where it has adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments. Its introduction has been largely limited to its native range, though it has occasionally spread to nearby areas with similar ecological conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes that mimic its natural habitat."
