    "intro": "Asparagus paragus, commonly known as the golden asparagus or the white asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, edible stems that are often harvested before they fully develop, giving them a tender texture. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round berries that contain the seeds. Its leaves are fern-like, with a delicate, feathery appearance, and it prefers well-drained soil and full sun. Asparagus paragus is valued both for its culinary use and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
