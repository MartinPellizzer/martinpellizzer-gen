    "intro": "Agonis conspicua, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Agonis conspicua thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers and streams. It is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
