It produces small, yellow-orange fruits that are covered in a rough, spiky exocarp. The plant's leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The fruit is edible, though its taste is generally described as bland or slightly tart."
