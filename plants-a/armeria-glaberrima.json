    "intro": "Armeria glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth sandspur, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
