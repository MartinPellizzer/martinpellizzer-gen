    "intro": "Arenaria alfacarensis, commonly known as the Alfacar sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions make it well adapted to its native environment. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
