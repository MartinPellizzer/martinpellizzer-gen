    "intro": "Aconitum hookeri, commonly known as Hooker's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum hookeri thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions.",
