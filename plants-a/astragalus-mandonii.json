    "intro": "Astragalus mandonii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to orange flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus mandonii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
