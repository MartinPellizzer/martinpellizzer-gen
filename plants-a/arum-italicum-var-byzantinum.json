    "intro": "Arum italicum var. byzantinum, commonly known as the Byzantine arrowhead, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking red or purple spadices, which are the inflorescences that house the true flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in water gardens or as a container plant. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
