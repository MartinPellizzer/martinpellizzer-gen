    "intro": "Anthyllis cherleri, commonly known as the creeping anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or dry habitats. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Anthyllis cherleri is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
