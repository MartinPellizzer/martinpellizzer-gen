    "intro": "Aconitum senanense subsp. senanense, commonly known as the Senanese monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmately compound leaves with a distinctive hood-shaped blossom, typical of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care, as all parts of the plant contain potent alkaloids.",
