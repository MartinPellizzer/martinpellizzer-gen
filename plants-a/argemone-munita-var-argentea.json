It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with five petals, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal uses, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes."
