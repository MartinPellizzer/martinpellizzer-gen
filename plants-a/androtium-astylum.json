    "intro": "Androtium astylum, commonly known as the velvet tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and have a slightly rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Androtium astylum is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, where it thrives in full sun."
