It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy inflorescences. The plant features narrow, lyrate-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native range."
