    "intro": "Aristida strictiflora, commonly known as rigid-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often tinged with red or brown, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
