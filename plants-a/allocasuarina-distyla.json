    "intro": "Allocasuarina distyla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are spirally arranged along the branches, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, which release them when the cones dry and split open. Allocasuarina distyla is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and inland areas, making it a resilient and ecologically important species."
