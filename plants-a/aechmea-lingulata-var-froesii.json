    "intro": "Aechmea lingulata var. froesii, commonly known as the Froes's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica and Panama. It is characterized by its rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater for the plant's survival. The plant produces striking red and orange inflorescences that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
