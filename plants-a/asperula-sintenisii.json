    "intro": "Asperula sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' azalea, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes azaleas and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring. Asperula sintenisii thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen foliage, which remains lush throughout the year."
