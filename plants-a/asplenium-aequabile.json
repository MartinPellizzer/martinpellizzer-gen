    "intro": "Asplenium aequabile, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into lance-shaped, serrated leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium aequabile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
