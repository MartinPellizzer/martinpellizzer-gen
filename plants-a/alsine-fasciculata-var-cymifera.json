It is a low-growing annual herb that typically forms dense mats or cushions, often with hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert and grassland ecosystems."
