    "intro": "Acorus pusillus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Asia and North America. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense tufts, often with a slight sheen. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Acorus pusillus thrives in shallow water or moist soil, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties. Its rhizomes contain compounds that have been historically valued for their medicinal and culinary uses.",
