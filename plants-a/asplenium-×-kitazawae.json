    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 kitazawae, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between *Asplenium trichomanes* and *Asplenium bulbiferum*. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
