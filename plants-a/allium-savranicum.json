    "intro": "Allium savranicum, commonly known as the savran garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbel-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Allium savranicum thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments."
