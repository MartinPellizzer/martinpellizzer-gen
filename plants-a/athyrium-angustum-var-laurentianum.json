    "intro": "Athyrium angustum var. laurentianum, commonly known as the narrow fern or Laurentian narrow fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
