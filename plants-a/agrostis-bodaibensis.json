It is native to the Arabian Peninsula, particularly found in the United Arab Emirates. This perennial grass is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny flowers, typical of many grass species."
