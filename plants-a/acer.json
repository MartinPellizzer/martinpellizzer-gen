    "intro": "Acer, commonly known as maple, is a genus of about 128 species of deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs. These plants are characterized by their opposite branching pattern and distinctive palmate leaves that often turn vibrant colors in autumn. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically green or yellow, while the fruits are paired samaras with winged seeds. Maple trees are widely distributed across the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. They are valued for their ornamental beauty, timber quality, and ecological importance in forest ecosystems."
