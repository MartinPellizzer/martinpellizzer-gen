    "intro": "Aspalathus angustissima, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and is closely related to other species in the Fabaceae family. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, which is a key factor in its ecological adaptation. It produces small, yellow flowers that attract pollinators, contributing to its role in local ecosystems. Aspalathus angustissima is also a source of the popular herbal tea known as rooibos."
