    "intro": "Atherolepis, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It consists of several species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their large, showy inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. They typically have arrow-shaped leaves and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Some species of Atherolepis are used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
