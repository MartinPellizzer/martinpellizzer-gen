    "intro": "Atraphaxis grandiflora, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, hairy, and often grayish-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Atraphaxis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging desert environments."
