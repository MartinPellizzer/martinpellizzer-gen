    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha perrieri is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the diverse ecosystems of this island nation, which is known for its unique and endemic flora. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within forested regions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within Madagascar, reflecting the island's distinct ecological conditions. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha perrieri was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in several coastal and lowland areas. The plant is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its introduction is believed to be accidental, likely through shipping or landscaping activities. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it has become a common weed in certain regions of Hawaii."
