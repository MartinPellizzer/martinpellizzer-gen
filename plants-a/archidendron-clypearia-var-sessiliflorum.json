It belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with elongated, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique sessile (stemless) arrangement of the floral parts. This variety is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, tropical environments."
