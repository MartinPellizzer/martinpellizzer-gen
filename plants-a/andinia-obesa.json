    "intro": "Andinia obesa, commonly known as the fat bladder, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its swollen, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Andinia obesa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
