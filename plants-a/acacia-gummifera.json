    "intro": "Acacia gummifera, commonly known as the gum acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Acacia gummifera is known for secreting a gummy substance from its bark, which has been used traditionally for various purposes. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gummifera is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Yemen and Oman. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and coastal areas. It is commonly found in savannas and along the edges of deserts. Acacia gummifera is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gummifera was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. This plant is often used for its gum production and as a source of timber. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments. It is also valued for its ability to prevent soil erosion and provide habitat for wildlife."
