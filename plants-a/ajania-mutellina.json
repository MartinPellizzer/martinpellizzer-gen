    "intro": "Ajania mutellina, commonly known as the mountain ajania, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has a compact, cushion-like growth habit. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Ajania mutellina produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months."
