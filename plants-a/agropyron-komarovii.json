    "intro": "Agropyron komarovii, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating low temperatures and poor soil conditions. Agropyron komarovii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
