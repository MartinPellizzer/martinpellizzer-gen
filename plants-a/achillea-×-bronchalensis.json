The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, flat-topped flower heads that range in color from white to pink. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained soils in full sun. Achillea \u00d7 bronchalensis is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine.",
