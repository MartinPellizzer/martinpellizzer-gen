    "intro": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled burrplant, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its spiny, spherical fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fibrous, woody husk. The plant has alternate, simple leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The species is notable for its ecological role in providing food for native birds and insects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. latisepala is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of Canterbury and Otago. This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is commonly associated with subalpine and alpine environments. The plant is an important component of the native vegetation in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon subsp. latisepala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in grasslands and forest margins. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local biodiversity."
