    "intro": "Acrostichum albescens, commonly known as the white brake fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that are typically light green to white in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in swamps and along riverbanks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. The white brake fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems.",
