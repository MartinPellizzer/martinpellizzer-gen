The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps, often growing along streambanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
