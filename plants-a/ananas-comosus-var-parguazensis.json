    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. parguazensis, commonly known as the Parguazensis pineapple, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the pineapple plant. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a more pronounced and elongated shape compared to the standard pineapple. The plant produces a fruit with a distinct flavor profile, often described as more aromatic and less acidic than typical pineapples. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly the Parguaz region of Ecuador. Due to its limited distribution and specialized growing conditions, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying genetic diversity in the Ananas genus."
