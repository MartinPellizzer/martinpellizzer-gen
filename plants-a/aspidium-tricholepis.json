    "intro": "Aspidium tricholepis, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are typically short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a typical feature of ferns."
