This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. The species is known for its attractive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to a variety of environmental conditions across central and southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha subviscida was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions of the country. It is considered a potential weed in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to spread. However, it is not currently classified as invasive in New Zealand."
