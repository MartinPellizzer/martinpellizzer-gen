    "intro": "Astragalus transecticola, commonly known as the Transverse milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
