    "intro": "Angraecopsis holochila, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance and elongated, slender leaves that resemble tendrils. The plant produces striking, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators like hawkmoths. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found growing on cliffs or among rocks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
