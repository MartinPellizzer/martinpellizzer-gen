It is characterized by its large, showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, sunny environments and prefers well-drained soil. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from pets and children."
