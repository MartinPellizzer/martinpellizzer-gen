    "intro": "Alyssum macrocarpum, commonly known as the sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, rounded seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alyssum macrocarpum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, typically from spring to early summer."
