It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
