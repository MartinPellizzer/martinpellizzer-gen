    "intro": "Alsinanthus tetraqueter, commonly known as the narrowleaf alsike clover, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Alsinanthus tetraqueter is often used in forage and as a cover crop due to its hardy nature and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
