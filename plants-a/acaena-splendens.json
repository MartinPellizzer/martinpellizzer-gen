It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena splendens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. Despite its beauty, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a wide range of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its spread across many regions of the country."
