    "intro": "Aspidosperma laxiflorum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Copaifera* species, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody pods containing dark seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appearance and has been studied for its potential pharmacological properties. However, it is not commonly cultivated for commercial purposes due to its slow growth and specific environmental requirements."
