    "intro": "Arthraxon multinervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Cyperaceae, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense stands in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, three-ranked flowers, and it produces three-nerved, boat-shaped fruits. Arthraxon multinervis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
