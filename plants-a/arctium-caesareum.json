    "intro": "Arctium caesareum, commonly known as the common burdock. It is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that adhere to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium caesareum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
