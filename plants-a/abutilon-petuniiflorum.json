    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon petuniiflorum is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean region. It is found in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas. It is commonly found in cloud forests and along riverbanks. Its native range is characterized by high altitudes and diverse microhabitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon petuniiflorum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, trumpet-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value, particularly in regions with mild climates. This plant is often used in floral arrangements and as a decorative element in public spaces. Its introduction has also contributed to the diversity of flowering plants available for cultivation. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
