    "intro": "Altingia indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochinese alder, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Tiliaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
