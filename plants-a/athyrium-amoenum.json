    "intro": "Athyrium amoenum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to East Asia. It features finely divided, arching fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium amoenum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
