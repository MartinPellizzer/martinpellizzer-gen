    "intro": "Adenostegia, commonly known as the \"southern sand verbena,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plants typically grow in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Adenostegia species often have a compact growth habit with a basal rosette of leaves, and their flowers are often pollinated by birds or insects. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
