    "intro": "Asplenium semigoetzei, commonly known as the Goetze's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Asplenium semigoetzei is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution primarily in southern Africa."
