It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has linear, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
