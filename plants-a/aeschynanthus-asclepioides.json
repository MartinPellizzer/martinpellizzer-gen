    "intro": "Aeschynanthus asclepioides, commonly known as the flame violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that are typically bright red or orange, resembling small flames. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus asclepioides is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its showy flowers and compact growth habit."
