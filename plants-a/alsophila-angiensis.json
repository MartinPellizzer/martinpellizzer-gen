    "intro": "Alsophila angiensis, commonly known as the Angilais tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds. The plant exhibits a distinct dichotomy in its frond structure, with the lower fronds being more narrow and the upper ones broader. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's unique morphology makes it an important component of its ecological niche."
