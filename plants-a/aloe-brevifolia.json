    "intro": "Aloe brevifolia, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, upright rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are narrow and pointed. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Aloe brevifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and resilience."
