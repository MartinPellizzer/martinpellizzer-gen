    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. abbreviatus, commonly known as the shortleaf bluestem, is a variant of the common bluestem grass native to the southeastern United States. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant features narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its compact inflorescence and shorter leaf blades distinguish it from other varieties of Andropogon. It plays an important role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for wildlife."
