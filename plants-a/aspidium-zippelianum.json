    "intro": "Aspidium zippelianum, commonly known as the Zippel's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, serrated segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium zippelianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
