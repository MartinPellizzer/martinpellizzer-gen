It is characterized by its large, pentagon-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and fissured, often exuding a milky sap when damaged. The species is valued for its timber and has some traditional medicinal uses in local cultures."
