    "intro": "Aristida stenostachya, commonly known as narrow-stalked threeawn, is a grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Aristida stenostachya is adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystem."
