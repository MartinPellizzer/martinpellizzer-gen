    "intro": "Adicea nana, commonly known as the dwarf marsh orchid, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has fibrous roots that help it anchor in muddy or saturated soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often clustered at the base of the plant. Adicea nana thrives in moist environments and is often found in association with other wetland flora.",
