    "intro": "Astragalus capillatus, commonly known as the silky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Astragalus capillatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
