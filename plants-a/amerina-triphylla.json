It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to arid landscapes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and low-maintenance plant for xeriscaping."
