    "intro": "Aspidium subtriphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are wiry and produce numerous roots, allowing it to anchor itself in soil or substrates. The spores are released from small, round sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many ferns."
