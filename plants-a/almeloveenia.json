    "intro": "Almeloveenia, commonly known as the sweetgum tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Americas. It is characterized by its star-shaped leaves and distinctive spiky fruit capsules that contain numerous small, cottony seeds. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, spreading canopy. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Almeloveenia thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
