    "intro": "Asperula ciliatula, commonly known as the silky woodrush, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded forest understories. Asperula ciliatula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a delicate touch to woodland gardens."
