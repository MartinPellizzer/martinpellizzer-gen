    "intro": "Aechmea rosea, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking pink to red flower spikes that emerge from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating called bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Aechmea rosea thrives in bright, indirect light and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its vibrant appearance."
