    "intro": "Acineta humboldtii var. straminea, commonly known as the yellow acineta, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in coastal regions of Chile and Peru. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant is adapted to withstand strong sea winds and saline conditions. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.",
