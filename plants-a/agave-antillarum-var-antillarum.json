    "intro": "Agave antillarum var. antillarum, commonly known as the Mexican century plant, is a species of agave native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves, which are thick, fleshy, and often covered in a blue-gray waxy coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing numerous white or pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its slow growth and long lifespan, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
