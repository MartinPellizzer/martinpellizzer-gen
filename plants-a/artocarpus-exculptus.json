    "intro": "Artocarpus exculptus, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical species native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces a unique fruit that is typically harvested when green, though it can ripen off the tree. The fruit's interior contains a starchy, edible pulp surrounded by a fibrous layer. Botanically, it is notable for its compound inflorescences and its role in both ecological and cultural systems across its native range."
