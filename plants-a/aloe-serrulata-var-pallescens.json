    "intro": "Aloe serrulata var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with serrated edges that give it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and containers."
