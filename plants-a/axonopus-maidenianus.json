    "intro": "Axonopus maidenianus, commonly known as the slender grass or dwarf blady grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Axonopus maidenianus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
