    "intro": "Amphiestes, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and salt marshes, adapting to saline environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while the flowers bloom in late summer. Amphiestes plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small marine and terrestrial organisms."
