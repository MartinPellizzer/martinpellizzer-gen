    "intro": "Azukia reflexopilosa, commonly known as the hairy reflexed clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid regions. Azukia reflexopilosa is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it beneficial for soil fertility."
