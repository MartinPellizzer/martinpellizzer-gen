It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically borne in dense clusters at the top of tall, sparsely leafy stems. The plant belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic alkaloids, which make it dangerous to humans and animals. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its unique floral structure and vivid color make it a notable ornamental plant in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxicity.",
