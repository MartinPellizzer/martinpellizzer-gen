    "intro": "Aspidosperma, commonly known as the \"Brazilian cherry\" or \"southernwood,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their evergreen or semi-evergreen leaves, often arranged in opposite pairs, and their showy, usually fragrant flowers. Many species produce red or orange fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, often brightly colored aril. The genus includes both trees and shrubs, with some species reaching heights of over 20 meters. Aspidosperma species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Brazil, Mexico, and Central America."
