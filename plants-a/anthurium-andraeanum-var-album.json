    "intro": "Anthurium andraeanum var. album, commonly known as the white anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Colombia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped, white spathes that contrast beautifully with its deep green, velvety foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers inside the spathe, which are typically yellow or green. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive as a houseplant."
