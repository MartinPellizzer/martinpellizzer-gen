It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescence with brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is a subject of interest in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
