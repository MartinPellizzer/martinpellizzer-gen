    "intro": "Arenaria paniculata, commonly known as the sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas. Arenaria paniculata is also known for its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a hardy choice for gardens and restoration projects."
