    "intro": "Arenaria aculeata, commonly known as the prickly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth form that minimizes water loss. Its stems are often covered in tiny, sharp spines, providing protection from herbivores. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy and rocky soils in its native habitats."
