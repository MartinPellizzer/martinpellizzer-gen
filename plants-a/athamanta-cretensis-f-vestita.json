    "intro": "Athamanta cretensis f. vestita, commonly known as the Cretan Athamanta, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences. The plant is distinguished by its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers and hairy foliage, which is a key feature of the 'vestita' form. It thrives in limestone soils and is typically found in rocky or calcareous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
