    "intro": "Aphanostylis, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically small, with slender stems and dense, tufted growth patterns. They are often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Aphanostylis species usually have narrow leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The genus is characterized by its lack of visible leaf sheaths, a distinguishing botanical feature."
