    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon histrix is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, particularly in parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. It thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often found on slopes and cliffs where the climate is dry and sunny. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with its succulent leaves helping it retain moisture. It is commonly seen in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Morocco. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon histrix was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in well-drained, arid conditions and is commonly found in regions with mild, dry summers and cool, wet winters. This plant is typically introduced to disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and agricultural fields. It has a low-growing habit with dense, spiny foliage that helps it retain moisture and resist grazing. Due to its hardy nature, it can spread rapidly and establish itself in new habitats."
