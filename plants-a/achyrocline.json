These plants are native to the Americas, particularly found in tropical and subtropical regions. They typically have opposite, simple leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive aromatic scent. The flowers are usually small and clustered in heads, with ray florets that can be white, yellow, or red. Achyrocline species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
