    "intro": "Aspidium insigne, commonly known as the noble fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, elegant fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and are often used in traditional medicine. Aspidium insigne thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
