    "intro": "Agave involuta, commonly known as the curled agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, waxy leaves that curl inward, giving it its common name. The leaves are typically blue-gray in color, with sharp spines along the edges. It produces a tall flower stalk that bears white or pale green flowers, which bloom in the spring. This plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments."
