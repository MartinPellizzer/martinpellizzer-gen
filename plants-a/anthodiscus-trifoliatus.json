    "intro": "Anthodiscus trifoliatus, commonly known as the three-leaf water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a dense cluster at the base of the plant. Anthodiscus trifoliatus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
