It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. These flowers are followed by small, round, orange-red fruits that contain a single seed. Adenandra crenata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sandy soils.",
