    "intro": "Acacia cyperophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Acacia cyperophylla plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cyperophylla is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cyperophylla was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or coastal soils, particularly in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of southern Australia, including New South Wales and Victoria. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
