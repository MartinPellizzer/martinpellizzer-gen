    "intro": "Asperula rigida, commonly known as the rigid wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its stems are woody and often have a distinctive rigid texture, which gives it its common name. Asperula rigida is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often thriving in alpine and subalpine environments."
