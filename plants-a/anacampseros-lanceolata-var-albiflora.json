It features fleshy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted for water storage. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
