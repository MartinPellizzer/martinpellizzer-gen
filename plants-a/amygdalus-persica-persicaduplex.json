    "intro": "Amygdalus persica persicaduplex, commonly known as the Persian almond or double-flowered almond, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus persica (peach) and Prunus dulcis (almond). It is characterized by its distinctive double flowers, which have more petals than the typical single-flowered varieties. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to peaches but have a milder flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and unique floral structure, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
