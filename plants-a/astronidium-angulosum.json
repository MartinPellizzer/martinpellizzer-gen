    "intro": "Astronidium angulosum, commonly known as the angular astronidium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its woody stems and elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by capsule fruits. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
