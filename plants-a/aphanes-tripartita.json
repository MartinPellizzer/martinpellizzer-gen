    "intro": "Aphanes tripartita, commonly known as the three-parted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its clustered, prostrate stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has tiny, scale-like leaves that are arranged in three parts, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Aphanes tripartita is an important species in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing sandy environments."
