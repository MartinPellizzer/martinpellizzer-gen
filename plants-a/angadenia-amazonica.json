    "intro": "Angadenia amazonica, commonly known as the Amazonian angadenia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes plants known for their milky sap and often showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Angadenia amazonica is adapted to the humid, shaded environments of the Amazonian canopy, where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest understory."
