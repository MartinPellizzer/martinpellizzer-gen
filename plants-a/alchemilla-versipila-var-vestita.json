It features dense, fuzzy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. The leaves are also used in traditional herbal remedies for their purported healing properties."
