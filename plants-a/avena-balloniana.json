    "intro": "Avena balloniana, commonly known as balloon grass, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated seed heads that resemble small balloons, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas and is often found in disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Avena balloniana is an annual plant that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats."
