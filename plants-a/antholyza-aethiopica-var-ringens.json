It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when immature and turn red when mature. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in arid regions."
