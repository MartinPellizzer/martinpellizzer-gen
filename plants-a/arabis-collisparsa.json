    "intro": "Arabis collisparsa, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of elliptical, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
