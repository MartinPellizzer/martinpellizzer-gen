    "intro": "Azorella boelckei, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing cushions of foliage that help it survive in harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually thick and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Azorella boelckei is adapted to grow in rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments."
