    "intro": "Armeria canescens var. brachyphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, adapted to withstand salty sea air and coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun. This variety is prized for its hardiness and ornamental value in coastal gardens and rockeries."
