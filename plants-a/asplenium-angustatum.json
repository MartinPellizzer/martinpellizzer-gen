    "intro": "Asplenium angustatum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium angustatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
