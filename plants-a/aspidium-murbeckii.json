    "intro": "Aspidium murbeckii, commonly known as the Murbeck's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spores are released from sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium murbeckii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
