    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus subsp. diminutum, commonly known as the dwarf snapdragon, is a compact, herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features vibrant, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, yellow, and orange, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and grows to a height of only a few inches, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value. This subspecies is closely related to the common snapdragon but is distinguished by its smaller size and unique floral characteristics."
