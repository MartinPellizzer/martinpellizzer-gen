    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba subsp. indivisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in dense, compact clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
