    "intro": "Acacia carolina, commonly known as the Carolina acacia, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, also known as the legume or bean family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Acacia carolina is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia carolina is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including parts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes, maritime hammocks, and other coastal habitats. This species is adapted to the humid subtropical climate and can tolerate salt spray and wind. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia carolina is also sometimes referred to as the Carolina wattle.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia carolina was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and deep root system. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for various environmental conditions. Its ability to fix nitrogen also improves soil fertility over time. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
