It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in supporting native pollinators."
