    "intro": "Allenrolfea vaginata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers that are followed by triangular, woody fruits containing several seeds. Allenrolfea vaginata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
