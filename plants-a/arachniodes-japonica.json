    "intro": "Arachniodes japonica, commonly known as the Japanese spider fern, is a fern species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble the legs of a spider, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
