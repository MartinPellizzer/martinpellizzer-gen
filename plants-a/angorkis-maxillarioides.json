    "intro": "Angorkis maxillarioides, commonly known as the Ghost Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy flowers that often resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on trees or in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with intricate patterns that enhance their visual appeal. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
