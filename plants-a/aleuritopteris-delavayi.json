    "intro": "Aleuritopteris delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's water fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a distinctive, lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aleuritopteris delavayi is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
