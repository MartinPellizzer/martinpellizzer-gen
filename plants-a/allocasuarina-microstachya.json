    "intro": "Allocasuarina microstachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaved she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like phyllodes that are typically narrow and linear, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense, cylindrical spikes, which are borne on the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia. Allocasuarina microstachya is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
