    "intro": "Artemisia macra, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia macra is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
