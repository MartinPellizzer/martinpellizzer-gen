    "intro": "Arceuthobium epiviscum, commonly known as the sticky false witchgrass, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to the roots of other plants, primarily grasses. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the fruit, which contains a sticky substance. Due to its parasitic nature, it can negatively impact the growth and survival of its host plants."
