    "intro": "Aegiphila reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
