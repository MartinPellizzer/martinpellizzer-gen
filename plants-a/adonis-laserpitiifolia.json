    "intro": "Adonis laserpitiifolia, commonly known as the purple-flowered adonis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, blue-green leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
