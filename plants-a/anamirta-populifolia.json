    "intro": "Anamirta populifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf soursop, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a climbing shrub characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by inedible, spiny fruits. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Anamirta populifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and coastal areas."
