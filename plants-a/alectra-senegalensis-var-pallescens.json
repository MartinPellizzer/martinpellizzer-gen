    "intro": "Alectra senegalensis var. pallescens, commonly known as the Senegalese sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the Sahelian regions of Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or dry soils. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
