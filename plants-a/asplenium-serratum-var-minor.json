    "intro": "Asplenium serratum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser serrated holly fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, serrated fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, acidic soil. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread through the undergrowth. The fronds are evergreen, maintaining their color throughout the year, making it a valuable addition to shaded gardens."
