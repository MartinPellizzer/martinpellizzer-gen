    "intro": "Anacamptis pyramidalis var. urvilleana, commonly known as the Urville's pyramidal orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are arranged in a pyramidal inflorescence, which gives the species its common name. The variety urvilleana is distinguished by its slightly different flower coloration and growth habit compared to the typical form of Anacamptis pyramidalis."
