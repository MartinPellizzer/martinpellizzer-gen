    "intro": "Acacia retivenea subsp. retivenea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which appear in spring. Its seeds are encased in elongated pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It typically grows in open woodlands, shrublands, and rocky outcrops. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia retivenea subsp. retivenea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it adaptable to a range of environmental conditions. It has been introduced for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping. However, it can also pose a threat to native ecosystems if it spreads beyond controlled areas."
