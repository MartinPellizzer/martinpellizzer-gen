    "intro": "Asplenium tremulum, commonly known as the trembling spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant has a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. Its fronds are delicate and often sway slightly in the wind, contributing to its common name. Asplenium tremulum is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in humid conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental appeal."
