It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus macdougalii plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
