    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon graveolens is primarily native to the Caribbean, Central America, and northern South America. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and parts of Brazil. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. It is also present in some parts of southern Florida in the United States. Its natural habitat includes forests, shrublands, and disturbed sites where it can grow vigorously.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon graveolens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Efforts to control its spread often involve manual removal and herbicide application."
