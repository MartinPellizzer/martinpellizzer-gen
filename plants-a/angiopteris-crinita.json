It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are robust and often used in traditional medicine. The fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with a distinctive appearance that makes it easily recognizable."
