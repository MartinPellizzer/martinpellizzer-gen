    "intro": "Agropyron angustifolium, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, and is often found in disturbed soils. Agropyron angustifolium is valued for its resilience and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
