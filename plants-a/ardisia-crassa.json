    "intro": "Ardisia crassa, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red berries in the winter. Its berries are edible but contain small seeds, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ardisia crassa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is relatively resistant to pests and diseases."
