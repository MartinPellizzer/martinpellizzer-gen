    "intro": "Aristida curtiseta, commonly known as curly hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves that form dense, compact tufts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, spikelet-based flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Aristida curtiseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
