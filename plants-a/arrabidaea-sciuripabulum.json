    "intro": "Arrabidaea sciuripabulum, commonly known as the squirrel-eating tree, is a woody shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant is notable for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the pods explosively release seeds upon maturity. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or woodland areas. Due to its ecological role and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
