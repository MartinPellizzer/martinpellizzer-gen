It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and have a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Acetosella glandulosa is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to sorrel.",
