    "intro": "Artemisia quadripedalis, commonly known as the four-footed wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its grayish-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish flower clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with multiple stems arising from the base. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Artemisia quadripedalis is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
