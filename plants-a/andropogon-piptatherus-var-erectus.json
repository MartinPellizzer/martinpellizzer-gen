It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically 30 to 100 cm in height. This grass thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers.
