The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are borne on long, drooping panicles. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a pointed tip. Asperula paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to moist, well-drained soils."
