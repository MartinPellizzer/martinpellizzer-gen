    "intro": "Archangelica officinalis var. silvestris, commonly known as wild angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and tall, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are rich in essential oils and have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its size and aromatic properties, it is both ecologically significant and historically valued in herbal remedies."
