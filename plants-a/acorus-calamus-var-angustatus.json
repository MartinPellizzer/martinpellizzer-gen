    "intro": "Acorus calamus var. angustatus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia and North America. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinct, pleasant scent. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties. Acorus calamus var. angustatus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, along pond edges, and in other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments.",
