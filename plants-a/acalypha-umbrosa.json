    "intro": "Acalypha umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Acalypha umbrosa is also valued for its ability to purify air and its use in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha umbrosa is primarily native to the Mexican Pacific Is., Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in the coastal regions of these areas. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity. The species is often associated with moist, shaded environments in its native habitat. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha umbrosa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories and rocky slopes. It thrives in regions with high humidity and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in tropical and subtropical climates. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in invaded habitats. Its introduction has led to concerns in some regions due to its potential to outcompete native species. It is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique flower structures."
