    "intro": "Astragalus solitarius, commonly known as the solitary milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, oval leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus solitarius plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
