    "intro": "Aconitum lobelianum, commonly known as the European aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple spurred flowers in late summer, typically from July to September. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum lobelianum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats.",
