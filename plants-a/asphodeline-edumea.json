    "intro": "Asphodeline edumea, commonly known as the Alpine asphodel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and tall, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Asphodeline edumea is often used in rock gardens and alpine collections due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
