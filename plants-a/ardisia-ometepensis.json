    "intro": "Ardisia ometepensis, commonly known as the Ometepe ardisia, is a species of flowering plant native to the volcanic island of Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua. It belongs to the family Myrsinaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pinkish flowers followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Ardisia ometepensis is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within the cloud forests of the region. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
