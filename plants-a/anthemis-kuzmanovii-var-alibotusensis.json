    "intro": "Anthemis kuzmanovii var. alibotusensis, commonly known as the Alibotus mountain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
