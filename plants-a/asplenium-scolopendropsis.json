    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendropsis, commonly known as the snake fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a short, upright rhizome with densely packed, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled when young. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the underside of the fronds. Asplenium scolopendropsis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens or as a houseplant."
