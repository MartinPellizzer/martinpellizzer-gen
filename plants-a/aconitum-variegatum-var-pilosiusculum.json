    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum var. pilosiusculum, commonly known as the velvet aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from areas accessible to children and pets.",
