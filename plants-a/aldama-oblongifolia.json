    "intro": "Aldama oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Aldama oblongifolia is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
