    "intro": "Astracantha marschalliana, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe. It features a slender, erect stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, bearing opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of the Orchidaceae family. Its root system consists of rhizomes and fibrous roots, allowing it to thrive in waterlogged soils. Astracantha marschalliana plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
