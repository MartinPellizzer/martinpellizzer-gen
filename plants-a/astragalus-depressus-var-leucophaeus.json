    "intro": "Astragalus depressus var. leucophaeus, commonly known as the white-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
