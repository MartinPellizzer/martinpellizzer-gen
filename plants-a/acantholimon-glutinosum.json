    "intro": "Acantholimon glutinosum, commonly known as sticky stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a sticky, waxy substance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant.",

This plant thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is often seen in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon glutinosum was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where water is scarce and temperatures can be extreme. This plant is typically found in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure. It has adapted to these harsh conditions through its deep root system and succulent leaves. Its introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in non-native habitats, raising concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
