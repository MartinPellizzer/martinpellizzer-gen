    "intro": "Astragalus halicacabus var. canescens, commonly known as the hoary milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its gray-green, hairy foliage and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
