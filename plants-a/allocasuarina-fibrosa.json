    "intro": "Allocasuarina fibrosa, commonly known as the silky casuarina, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are densely packed in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, typically appearing in spring. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones, which release them when dry. Allocasuarina fibrosa is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
