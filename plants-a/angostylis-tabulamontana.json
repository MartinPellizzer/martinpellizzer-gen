    "intro": "Angostylis tabulamontana, commonly known as the mountain table fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to rocky substrates. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
