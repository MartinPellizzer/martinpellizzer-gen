It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. Its fruits are drupes, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, orange-red pulp. Allophylus appenduculatoserratus is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories at high elevations."
