    "intro": "Avena fatua subvar. pumila, commonly known as dwarf oat, is a short, mat-forming grass species native to Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with compact, hairy leaves and spikelets that are often tinged with purple. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikelets that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are small and can remain viable in the soil for several years, contributing to its persistent presence in various habitats."
