It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with forested landscapes in its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer coriaceifolium was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and autumn coloration. It has been planted in various regions, including the northeastern United States and parts of Canada, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is often found in urban and suburban landscapes, where it is valued for its aesthetic appeal. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
