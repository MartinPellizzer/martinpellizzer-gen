    "intro": "Aster shortii f. gronemannii, commonly known as the Gronemann's aster, is a rare and compact perennial herb native to the central United States. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters, featuring small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, conical flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairie or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
