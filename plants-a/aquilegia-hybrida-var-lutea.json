    "intro": "Aquilegia hybrida var. lutea, commonly known as the golden monkeyflower, is a hybrid species of the genus Aquilegia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow petals that contrast with its green sepals, creating a striking visual display. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers are tubular with spurred petals, a feature common to many Aquilegia species, which aids in pollination by insects. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
