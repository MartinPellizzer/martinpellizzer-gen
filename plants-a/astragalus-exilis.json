It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Astragalus exilis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
