    "intro": "Aphyllocladus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their unique morphology, featuring a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, adapting them to arid environments. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Aphyllocladus species are native to regions with hot, dry climates, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East. They are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
