    "intro": "Ardisia furfuracella, commonly known as the velvetleaf ardisia, is a flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical gardens."
