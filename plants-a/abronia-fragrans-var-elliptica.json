    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia fragrans var. elliptica is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sand dunes along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime hammocks and scrub habitats. It is a low-growing shrub that produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. Due to habitat loss and development, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia fragrans var. elliptica was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. It is commonly found in regions with mild, temperate climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in areas with full sun exposure and moderate moisture levels. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its fragrant flowers and unique foliage. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
