    "intro": "Aiphanes bicornis, commonly known as the two-horned sago palm, is a distinctive plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Arecaceae family, characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and tall, unbranched stems. The plant features large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts and as thatching materials. Its unique appearance, with two prominent spines at the base of the stem, gives it its common name. Aiphanes bicornis is well adapted to coastal and saline environments, making it a hardy and resilient species."
