    "intro": "Alchemilla strictissima, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright cymes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla strictissima is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators."
