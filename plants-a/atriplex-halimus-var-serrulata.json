    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. serrulata, commonly known as the serrated saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and drought conditions. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
