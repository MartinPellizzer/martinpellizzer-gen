    "intro": "Alpinia antillarum var. puberula, commonly known as the pink ginger, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking pinkish-red flowers and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The varietal form, puberula, distinguishes it from the typical species through its hairy, pubescent leaves."
