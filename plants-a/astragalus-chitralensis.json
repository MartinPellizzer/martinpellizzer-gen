    "intro": "Astragalus chitralensis, commonly known as the Chitral milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets arranged in pairs, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus chitralensis is considered a rare and endemic species."
