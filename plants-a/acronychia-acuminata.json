    "intro": "Acronychia acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acronychia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Burseraceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, elongated fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and open forests. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in tropical and subtropical regions.",
