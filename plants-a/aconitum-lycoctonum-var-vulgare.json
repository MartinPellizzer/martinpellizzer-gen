    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. vulgare, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly pinnate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
