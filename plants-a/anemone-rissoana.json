    "intro": "Anemone rissoana, commonly known as the Risoan anemone, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant features showy, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a silvery underside that reflects sunlight. Anemone rissoana is adapted to salt spray and is an important part of the local coastal ecosystem."
