    "intro": "Astragalus desperatus var. typicus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus desperatus var. typicus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
