    "intro": "Angelica sylvestris var. decurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a distinctive aromatic scent. The plant produces compound, feather-like leaves that are narrower and more elongated compared to the typical variety. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). The roots are thick, fleshy, and contain compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine."
