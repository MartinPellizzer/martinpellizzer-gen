    "intro": "Atriplex lentiformis subsp. breweri, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces green to yellowish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
