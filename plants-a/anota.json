    "intro": "Anota, commonly known as the Indian nettle or Urena lobata, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a soft, hairy texture and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its seeds are encased in a fluffy, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Anota is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
