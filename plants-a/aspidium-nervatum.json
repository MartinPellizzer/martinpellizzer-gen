    "intro": "Aspidium nervatum, commonly known as the veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into narrow, feather-like segments. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are often submerged, allowing it to spread vegetatively through runners. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
