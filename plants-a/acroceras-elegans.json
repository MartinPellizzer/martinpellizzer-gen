It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Acroceras elegans is relatively uncommon and is often found in specific microhabitats across parts of Europe and Asia.",
