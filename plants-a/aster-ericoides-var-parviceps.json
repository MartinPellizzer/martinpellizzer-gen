    "intro": "Aster ericoides var. parviceps, commonly known as the dwarf heath aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heathlands and pine barrens. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall, ranging in color from white to pink. Its foliage consists of narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in a compact, cushion-like form. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
