    "intro": "Atriplex frigida, commonly known as silverleaf shadscale, is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet in height. Atriplex frigida is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in deserts, grasslands, and along riverbanks."
