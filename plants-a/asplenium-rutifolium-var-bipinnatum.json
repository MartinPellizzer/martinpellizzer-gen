    "intro": "Asplenium rutifolium var. bipinnatum, commonly known as the bipinnate spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate fronds that give it a delicate, lacy appearance. This variety typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are usually dark green and have a creeping habit, often forming dense mats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it a common yet specialized member of the fern flora."
