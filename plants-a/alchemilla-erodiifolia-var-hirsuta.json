It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in rounded clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects its historical use in folk medicine for its purported healing properties."
