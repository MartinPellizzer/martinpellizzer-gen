    "intro": "Anthoxanthum hirtum, commonly known as hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, slender blades that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to golden florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum hirtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
