    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha racemosa is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It is known for its distinctive red bracts that attract pollinators. Its distribution is largely confined to regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha racemosa was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, showy inflorescences. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. Despite its ornamental appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant's rapid growth and prolific seed production contribute to its spread beyond cultivated areas. It is important to monitor its distribution to prevent ecological disruption in native habitats."
