It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It often grows in sandy or rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. Its ability to thrive in extreme climates makes it an important species for ecological studies in desert ecosystems."
