    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 bouharmontii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 bouharmontii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and adaptability to indoor growing conditions."
