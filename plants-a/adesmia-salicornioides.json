    "intro": "Adesmia salicornioides, commonly known as the sea bean or salt bean, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa and thrives in saline soils near the sea. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, coastal conditions.",
