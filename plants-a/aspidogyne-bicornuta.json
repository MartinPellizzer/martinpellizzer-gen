    "intro": "Aspidogyne bicornuta, commonly known as the two-horned aspidogyne, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive two horn-like structures on its fruit, which give it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
