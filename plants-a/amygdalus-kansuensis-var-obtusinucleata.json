    "intro": "Amygdalus kansuensis var. obtusinucleata, commonly known as the Kansu almond. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China, characterized by its dense, thorny branches and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that are similar to almonds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in dry, rocky soils. The variety is distinguished by its obtuse (blunt) nutlets, which are a key botanical feature."
