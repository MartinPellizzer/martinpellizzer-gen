    "intro": "Alsomitra schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's alsomitra, is a rare and unique member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange, often with intricate patterns. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
