    "intro": "Anemotrochus, commonly known as the windwheel tree, is a unique plant belonging to the family Anemotrichaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-shaped leaves that resemble a windmill, which help it capture wind for pollination. The plant is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of yellow or green. Due to its rare occurrence and specific habitat requirements, Anemotrochus is considered a conservation concern."
