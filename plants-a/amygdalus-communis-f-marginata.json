    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. marginata, commonly known as the pink-leaf peach. This cultivar is a variant of the common peach, characterized by its distinctive pink-tinged leaves and flowers. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a moderate height, with a rounded crown. The leaves are usually ovate, with a smooth margin and a lighter coloration compared to the standard peach variety. It produces sweet, yellow-orange fruits that are similar in taste to regular peaches but often have a more delicate flavor."
