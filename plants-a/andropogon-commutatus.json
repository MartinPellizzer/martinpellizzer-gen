    "intro": "Andropogon commutatus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often folded in a V-shape, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Andropogon commutatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
