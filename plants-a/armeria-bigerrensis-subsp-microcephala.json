It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to withstand salty air and coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often used in rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its compact form and hardy nature make it a popular choice for gardeners in maritime climates."
