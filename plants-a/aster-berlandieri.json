    "intro": "Aster berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Aster berlandieri is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
