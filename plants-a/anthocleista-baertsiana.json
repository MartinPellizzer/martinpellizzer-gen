    "intro": "Anthocleista baertsiana, commonly known as the African moonseed, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often thorny bark and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Anthocleista baertsiana is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
