    "intro": "Asclepias paupercula, commonly known as the poorplant milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive, rounded seed pods that contain numerous tiny, fluffy seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. Asclepias paupercula is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for its larvae. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions."
