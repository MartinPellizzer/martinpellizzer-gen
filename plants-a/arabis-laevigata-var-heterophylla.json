    "intro": "Arabis laevigata var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variable rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its variable leaf morphology, which can range from narrow to broad depending on environmental conditions."
