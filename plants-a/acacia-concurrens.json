    "intro": "Acacia concurrens, commonly known as the weeping acacia, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its pendulous, feathery foliage that gives it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are followed by flat, bean-like pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Acacia concurrens is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia concurrens is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. This species is commonly found in dry, sandy soils across these regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and grasslands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining soil stability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia concurrens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Australia and was brought to South Africa for ornamental purposes due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to concerns over biodiversity loss and land degradation in certain regions. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its ecological impact."
