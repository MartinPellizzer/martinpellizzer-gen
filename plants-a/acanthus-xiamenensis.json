    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus xiamenensis is primarily native to the coastal regions of Fujian Province in southeastern China. It is commonly found in areas with sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates with ample sunlight. It is often seen growing in tidal zones and near the mouths of rivers. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus xiamenensis was mainly introduced to coastal regions of southeastern China, particularly in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it can tolerate salt spray and moderate tidal conditions. This plant is often found in urban and suburban landscapes due to its ornamental value and adaptability. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and public parks as a decorative species. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native coastal flora."
