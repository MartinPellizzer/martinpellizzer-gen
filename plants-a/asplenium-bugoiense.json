    "intro": "Asplenium bugoiense, commonly known as the Bugoiense spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori surrounded by indusia. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
