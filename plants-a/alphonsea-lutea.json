    "intro": "Alphonsea lutea, commonly known as the yellow alphonsea, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Alphonsea lutea thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
