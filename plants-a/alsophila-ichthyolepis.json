It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The fronds are bi-directionally divided, giving the plant a distinctive, lace-like appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The plant's name refers to the fish-scale-like patterns on its young fronds."
