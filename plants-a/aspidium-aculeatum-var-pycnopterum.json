    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. pycnopterum, commonly known as the dense-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its dense, compact fronds that are typically shorter and more robust compared to the typical variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, toothed pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. This variant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate a range of water conditions."
