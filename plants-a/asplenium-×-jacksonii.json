    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 jacksonii, commonly known as the Jackson's spleenwort, is a hybrid fern that results from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its dense, compact growth and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically forms a rosette of leaves that are covered in tiny, spore-producing structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks. Asplenium \u00d7 jacksonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor setting."
