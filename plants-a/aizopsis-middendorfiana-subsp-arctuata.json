It is characterized by its striking, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of numerous white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention.
