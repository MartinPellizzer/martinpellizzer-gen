    "intro": "Arceuthobium guatemalense, commonly known as the Guatemalan witchweed, is a parasitic plant that belongs to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically attaching itself to the roots of grasses or other herbaceous plants. The plant is notable for its unique dispersal mechanism, where its seeds are propelled through a explosive mechanism when disturbed. It is native to Central America, including Guatemala, and is often found in disturbed or wetland habitats. Due to its parasitic nature, it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops."
