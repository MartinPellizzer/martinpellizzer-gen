    "intro": "Armeria alpina f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
