    "intro": "Astragalus basiflorus, commonly known as the base-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus basiflorus is known for its deep root system, which allows it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
