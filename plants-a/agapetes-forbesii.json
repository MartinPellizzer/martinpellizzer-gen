It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that often exhibits a silvery or whitish underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments, such as cloud forests, where it thrives in shaded conditions. Its small, bell-shaped flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are attractive to birds. Agapetes forbesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage and ecological significance."
