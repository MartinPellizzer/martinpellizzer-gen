    "intro": "Artemisia lancea, commonly known as slender wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia lancea is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which have been used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
