    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 shikokianum, commonly known as the Shikokian spleenwort, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Native to Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
