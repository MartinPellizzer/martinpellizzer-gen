    "intro": "Alnus serrulata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and small, cone-like fruits that mature in the fall. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along forest edges. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
