    "intro": "Achillea millefolium var. sordida, commonly known as the sordid yarrow, is a variant of the common yarrow plant. It is a flowering perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of gray-green, fern-like leaves and produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is characterized by its reduced flowering compared to the typical variety, giving it a more subdued appearance. This variant is often found in the western United States and is valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties.",
