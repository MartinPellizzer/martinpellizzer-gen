    "intro": "Asteriscus aquaticus subsp. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf water aster, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, sunny conditions and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens or as a bog plant."
