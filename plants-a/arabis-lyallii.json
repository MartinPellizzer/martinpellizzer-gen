    "intro": "Arabis lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. This species is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Arabis lyallii thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a food source for native insects and its contribution to the biodiversity of its habitat."
