    "intro": "Agropyron littorale var. littoreum, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize shorelines and tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
