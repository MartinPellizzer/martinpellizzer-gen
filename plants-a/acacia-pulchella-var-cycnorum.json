    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. cycnorum is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Southwestern United States, including parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. This variant is commonly found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. The plant is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed areas within its native range. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. cycnorum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought to these regions in the late 19th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plant species for landscaping purposes. Despite its aesthetic value, the plant has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and mitigate ecological impacts. However, it remains a popular choice in tropical gardens and public spaces for its visual appeal."
