    "intro": "Allium melliferum, commonly known as honey garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features a bulbous stem with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is characterized by its pungent, garlicky odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. Its bulbs are edible and have a flavor similar to garlic but with a milder, sweeter taste. Allium melliferum is often grown for its ornamental value and culinary uses."
