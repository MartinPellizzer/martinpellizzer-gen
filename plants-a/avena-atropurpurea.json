    "intro": "Avena atropurpurea, commonly known as purple wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it suitable for native plant gardens and restoration projects. Avena atropurpurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to support local wildlife."
