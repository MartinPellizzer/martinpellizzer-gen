    "intro": "Acanthophyllum luteum, commonly known as the yellow burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has adapted to harsh desert conditions with deep root systems and small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its growth habit forms low, cushion-like mounds, which help it resist wind and conserve moisture. Acanthophyllum luteum plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Iranian landscape. It is often seen in desert and steppe environments. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum luteum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and China. It is commonly found in sandy and gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation. This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
