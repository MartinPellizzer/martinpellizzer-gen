    "intro": "Andropogon chrysopus, commonly known as golden bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, golden-yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in panicle inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. Andropogon chrysopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
