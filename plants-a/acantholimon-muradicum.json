    "intro": "Acantholimon muradicum, commonly known as the Muradik thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Acantholimon muradicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon muradicum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in various regions across the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as steppes and slopes. It is adapted to the dry and semi-arid conditions prevalent in its native range. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species within Turkey.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon muradicum was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in areas with dry, rocky soils. It is commonly found in regions such as California, Nevada, and parts of Oregon. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open habitats like grasslands and disturbed areas. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
