    "intro": "Allium liliputianum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic, is a small bulbous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
