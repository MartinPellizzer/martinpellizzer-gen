    "intro": "Agave baxteri, commonly known as the Baxters agave, is a species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, after which the plant dies. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
