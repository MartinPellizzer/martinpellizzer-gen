    "intro": "Atropis distans var. halophila, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in wetlands and tidal areas. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in the early morning. It is adapted to withstand high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by water and birds, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
