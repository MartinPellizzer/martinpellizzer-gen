    "intro": "Alisma gramineum subsp. wahlenbergii, commonly known as Wahlenberg's water plantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small white flowers. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in aquatic environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and slightly pointed, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. This subspecies is native to northern regions of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates."
