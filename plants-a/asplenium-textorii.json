    "intro": "Asplenium textorii, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that often exhibit a zigzag pattern along their length. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate. Asplenium textorii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
