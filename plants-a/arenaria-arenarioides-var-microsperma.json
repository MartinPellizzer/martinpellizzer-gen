    "intro": "Arenaria arenarioides var. microsperma, commonly known as the small-seeded sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal by wind. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
