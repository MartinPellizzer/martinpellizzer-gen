    "intro": "Axonopus steyermarkii, commonly known as the narrowleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming dense mats. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Axonopus steyermarkii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
