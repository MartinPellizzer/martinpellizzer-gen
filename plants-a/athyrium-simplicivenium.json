    "intro": "Athyrium simplicivenium, commonly known as the simple-veined maidenhair fern, is a species native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly glossy texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The fern's intricate venation pattern contributes to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
