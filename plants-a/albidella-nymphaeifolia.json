    "intro": "Albidella nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Albidella, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are usually light green in color, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the early morning. Albidella nymphaeifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
