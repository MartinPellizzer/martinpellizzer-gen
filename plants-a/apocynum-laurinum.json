    "intro": "Apocynum laurinum, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has smooth, often hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Apocynum laurinum plays a role in supporting pollinators, though it is not a primary host plant for monarch butterflies."
