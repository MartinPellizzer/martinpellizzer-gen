    "intro": "Acer campbellii, commonly known as the Campbell's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters, with a broad, rounded canopy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

This species is commonly found in mountainous regions across these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with forested areas and rocky slopes. Its native range spans a diverse geographical region in Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campbellii was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental tree due to its unique appearance and cold hardiness. It is commonly found in gardens and parks, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant has been cultivated for its striking red foliage in the fall, making it a popular choice among horticulturists. However, it is not native to North America and has been introduced primarily through horticultural trade. Its distribution is limited to areas where it has been intentionally planted by humans."
