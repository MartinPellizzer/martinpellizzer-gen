It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Acuan velutinum is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils.",
