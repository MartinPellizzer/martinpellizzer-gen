It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is known for its drought tolerance and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
