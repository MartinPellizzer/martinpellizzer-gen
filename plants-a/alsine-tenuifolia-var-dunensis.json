    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. dunensis, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Its succulent nature makes it well adapted to drought conditions."
