    "intro": "Astragalus sesbanoides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to violet. The plant has small, compound leaves with stiff, needle-like leaflets, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus sesbanoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals."
