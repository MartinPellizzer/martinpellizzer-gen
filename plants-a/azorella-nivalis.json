    "intro": "Azorella nivalis, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a hardy cushion plant native to the cold, high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clusters of grass-like leaves that form a compact mat. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme conditions, including freezing temperatures and strong winds. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the summer months. Azorella nivalis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its harsh environment."
