    "intro": "Adiantum gravesii, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum gravesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
