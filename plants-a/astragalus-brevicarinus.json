    "intro": "Astragalus brevicarinus, commonly known as the short-horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has small, inflated pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus brevicarinus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
