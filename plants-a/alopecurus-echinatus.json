It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, each bearing a single, erect, bristled floret. Alopecurus echinatus is often found in temperate climates and is adapted to thrive in environments with moderate moisture levels."
