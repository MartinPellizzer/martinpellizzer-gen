    "intro": "Amsinckia debilis, commonly known as the desert smokeplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small dandelion blossoms. The plant has a low, sprawling growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amsinckia debilis is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
