It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. The plant is commonly found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to this specific region in China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon sinense var. edentatum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, velvety leaves. It has been introduced to several countries in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific environmental conditions and its relatively short growing season in cooler climates."
