    "intro": "Astragalus nuttallianus var. pilifer, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is often found in sagebrush-steppe ecosystems."
