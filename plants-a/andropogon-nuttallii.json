    "intro": "Andropogon nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Nuttall's bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
