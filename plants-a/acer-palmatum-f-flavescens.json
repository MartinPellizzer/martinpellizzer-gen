    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. flavescens, commonly known as the golden maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its striking golden-yellow foliage. This cultivar exhibits a compact, rounded growth habit with delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of orange and red in autumn. The leaves are typically smaller than those of the species, with a finely serrated margin. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. The plant is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its unique coloration and seasonal changes.",
