    "intro": "Aspalathus corymbosa, commonly known as the sweet bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round, red-brown fruits that contain a single seed each. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Aspalathus corymbosa is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
