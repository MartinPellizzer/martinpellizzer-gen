    "intro": "Andromeda rupestris, commonly known as the rock laurel, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features evergreen foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky or wooded slopes. Andromeda rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
