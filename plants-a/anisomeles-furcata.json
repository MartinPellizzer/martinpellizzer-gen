    "intro": "Anisomeles furcata, commonly known as the hairy poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its striking red bracts that surround small, yellowish flowers, which are actually the true flowers of the plant. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, also known as the spurge family, and is known for its succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Anisomeles furcata is typically cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and is often used in festive decorations. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
