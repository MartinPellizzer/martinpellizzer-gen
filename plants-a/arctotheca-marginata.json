    "intro": "Arctotheca marginata, commonly known as the coastal daisy or coastal star, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
