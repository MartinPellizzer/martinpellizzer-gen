    "intro": "Acrophyllum australe, commonly known as the coastal bottlebrush, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically red or pink in color. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the shoreline. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Acrophyllum australe is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
