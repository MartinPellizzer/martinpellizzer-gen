    "intro": "Agrostis maritima var. pseudopungens, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is tolerant of salt spray and wind. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
