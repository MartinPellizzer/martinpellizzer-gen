    "intro": "Agrostis fasciculata, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form compact clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis fasciculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and adaptability."
