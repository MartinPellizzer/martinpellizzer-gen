    "intro": "Amerorchis rotundifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed round-leaved orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species found in specific alpine habitats. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and delicate, pale green to white flowers. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to grow in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its narrow leaves distinguish it from the typical form of the species, which has broader foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
