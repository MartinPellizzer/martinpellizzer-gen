It features lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, with a subtle aromatic scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, fertile soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with high rainfall and warm climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha variabilis var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The distribution of this plant is primarily limited to cultivated areas and gardens. It has not become naturalized in the wild in New Zealand. However, it is monitored to ensure it does not spread beyond controlled environments."
