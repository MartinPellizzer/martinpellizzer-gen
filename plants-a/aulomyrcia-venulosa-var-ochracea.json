    "intro": "Aulomyrcia venulosa var. ochracea, commonly known as the ochraceous sandalwood, is a variant of the sandalwood genus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and use in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody pods containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, this species is considered endangered in its natural habitat."
