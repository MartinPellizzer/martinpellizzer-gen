    "intro": "Aa macra, commonly known as the Hawaiian fern tree, is a species of tree in the family Cyatheaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Aa macra plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its unique appearance and cultural significance make it a notable plant in Hawaiian botany.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa macra is primarily native to Colombia and Ecuador. It is commonly found in the Andean regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and montane forests. It is well adapted to the cool and humid climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa macra was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and garden cultivation. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with moderate moisture levels. This plant has spread to regions outside its native range, including parts of the Pacific Islands and coastal areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in some environments. However, it is not considered highly invasive in all regions where it has been introduced."
