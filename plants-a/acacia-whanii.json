    "intro": "Acacia whanii, commonly known as the k\u014dwhai tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The tree is known for its golden-yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its bark is smooth and greyish, while its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets. Acacia whanii plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native forests and is also valued for its ornamental beauty.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia whanii is primarily native to the coastal areas of eastern Australia, including Queensland and New South Wales. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, particularly in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. This species is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in dunes and other sandplain habitats, often forming dense shrubs or small trees. Acacia whanii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia whanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant's rapid growth and seed dispersal have led to its spread across several regions. Efforts are ongoing to control its population and prevent further ecological damage."
