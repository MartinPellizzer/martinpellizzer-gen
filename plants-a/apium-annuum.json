    "intro": "Apium annuum, commonly known as fennel, is an aromatic herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and feathery, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that form umbrella-like clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, oval, and have a distinctive anise-like fragrance. Fennel is often cultivated for its leaves, seeds, and bulb, which are used in culinary and medicinal applications."
