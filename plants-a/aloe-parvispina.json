    "intro": "Aloe parvispina, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or narrow-leaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Aloe parvispina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
