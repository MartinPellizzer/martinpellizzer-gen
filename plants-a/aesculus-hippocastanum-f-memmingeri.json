It is characterized by its distinctive, showy white or pink flowers that appear in late spring. The leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant produces large, spiny fruit capsules containing bright red, shiny seeds. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and parks. It is relatively disease-resistant and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun to partial shade."
