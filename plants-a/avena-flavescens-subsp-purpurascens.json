    "intro": "Avena flavescens subsp. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
