    "intro": "Amphipterygium molle, commonly known as the soft-leaved sand mat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
