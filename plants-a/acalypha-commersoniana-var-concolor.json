It is commonly found in the Amazon Basin and surrounding areas where the climate is warm and humid. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with riparian habitats and secondary forests. It is also known to occur in parts of Central America, including Panama and Colombia. Its distribution is closely linked to the presence of water bodies and shaded environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha commersoniana var. concolor was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Australia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain regions. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
