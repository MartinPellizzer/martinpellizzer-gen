    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum var. triangulare, commonly known as the Triangular Maidenhair Fern, is a striking fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds with a distinctive triangular outline, which gives it its common name. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a feathery appearance, with small, spore-bearing sori on the underside. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
