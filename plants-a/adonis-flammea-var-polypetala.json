    "intro": "Adonis flammea var. polypetala, commonly known as the flame pink or golden belladonna, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with a distinctive, bell-shaped corolla. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
