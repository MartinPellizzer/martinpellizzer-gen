    "intro": "Avena thellungii, commonly known as the Thellung's oat, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Avena thellungii is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
