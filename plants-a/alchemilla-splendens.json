    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens, commonly known as the splendour-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, shiny, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Alchemilla splendens is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
