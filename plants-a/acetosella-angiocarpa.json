    "intro": "Acetosella angiocarpa, commonly known as the red-stemmed sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are often reddish in color, which distinguishes it from other species in the genus. Acetosella angiocarpa is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor similar to sorrel.",
