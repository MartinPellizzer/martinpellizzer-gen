    "intro": "Alectra paludosa, commonly known as the marsh sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically forms dense mats near the water's edge, with small, clustered stems and tiny, white to pinkish flowers. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Alectra paludosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
