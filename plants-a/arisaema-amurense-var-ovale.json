    "intro": "Arisaema amurense var. ovale, commonly known as the Chinese arrowroot or umbrella plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and distinctive, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of a spadix enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into berries containing toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, caution is necessary as all parts of the plant contain calcium oxalate crystals, which can cause irritation upon contact or ingestion."
