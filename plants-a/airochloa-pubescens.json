    "intro": "Airochloa pubescens, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Airochloa pubescens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands, forest edges, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
