    "intro": "Ariocarpus trigonus var. minor, commonly known as the \"cactus mouse ear,\" is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, spiny, globular shape and small, fleshy leaves that are often mistaken for mouse ears. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its otherwise desolate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sought after by collectors and conservationists alike."
