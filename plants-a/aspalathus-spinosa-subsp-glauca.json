It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
