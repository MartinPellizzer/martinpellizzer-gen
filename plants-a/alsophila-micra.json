    "intro": "Alsophila micra, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its slender trunk and fronds that grow in a tight, compact arrangement. The plant typically reaches a height of less than one meter, making it ideal for small garden spaces or as a container plant. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist, shaded environments. Alsophila micra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
