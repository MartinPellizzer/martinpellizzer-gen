    "intro": "Andromachia acaulis, commonly known as the stemless bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and lacks a distinct stem, with its leaves directly arising from the root system. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming in summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
