    "intro": "Acanthus volubilis, commonly known as the creeping candleplant, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus volubilis is primarily native to the Andaman Is., Bangladesh, Malaya, Myanmar, Nicobar Is., and Thailand. This plant is commonly found in coastal and tropical regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The species is often seen growing along the edges of forests or in open habitats. Its distribution is closely associated with the humid and warm climates of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus volubilis was mainly introduced to gardens and ornamental landscapes due to its striking, palmate leaves and showy, spire-like flowers. It is commonly cultivated in temperate regions for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a challenge for gardeners and land managers. Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact has raised concerns about its use in certain environments."
