    "intro": "Amyxa kutcinensis, commonly known as the Kashmiri orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Kashmir Valley. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include slender stems, lanceolate leaves, and a single, fragrant flower per inflorescence. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
