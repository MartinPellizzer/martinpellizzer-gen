    "intro": "Anadenanthera, commonly known as the \"pea tree\" or \"jatob\u00e1,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its distinctive pod-like fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are bipinnate, and the flowers are typically yellow or orange, attracting pollinators. Anadenanthera species are also valued for their wood, which is hard and durable, and for their role in traditional medicine."
