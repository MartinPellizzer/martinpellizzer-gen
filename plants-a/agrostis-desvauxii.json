    "intro": "Agrostis desvauxii, commonly known as the desert grass or dwarf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets, which are adapted to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Agrostis desvauxii is well-suited for erosion control and is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes. Its ability to survive with minimal water makes it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
