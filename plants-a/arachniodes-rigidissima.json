    "intro": "Arachniodes rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid bamboo fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its stiff, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest understories."
