It features slender, upright stems with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a slight reddish tinge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
