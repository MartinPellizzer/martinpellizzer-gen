    "intro": "Ajania achilleoides, commonly known as the blue ajania, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Ajania achilleoides is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
