    "intro": "Andropogon orientalis, commonly known as oriental bluestem, is a perennial grass native to Asia, particularly found in regions of China, India, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and compact inflorescences that produce small, blue to purple florets. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshy areas, riparian zones, and wetlands. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Additionally, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive floral display."
