    "intro": "Athyrium densisorum, commonly known as the dense-veined lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that are densely veined, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to spread and establish in suitable habitats. The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family."
