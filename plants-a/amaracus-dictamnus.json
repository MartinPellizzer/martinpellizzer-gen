It features aromatic, grass-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, capable of storing nutrients and water. Amaracus dictamnus thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks."
