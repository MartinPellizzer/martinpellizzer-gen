    "intro": "Anthurium ovatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that house the small, inconspicuous flowers. Anthurium ovatum prefers bright, indirect light and consistently moist, well-draining soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid environment."
