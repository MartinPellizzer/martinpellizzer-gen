    "intro": "Arenaria groenlandica, commonly known as Greenland sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky soils, showcasing remarkable adaptability to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Arenaria groenlandica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting Arctic biodiversity."
