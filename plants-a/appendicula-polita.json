It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically blue or violet, with five petals and are borne in dense clusters. Appendicula polita is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
