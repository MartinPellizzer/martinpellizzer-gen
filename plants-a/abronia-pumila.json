    "intro": "Abronia pumila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry plains. Abronia pumila plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia pumila is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of California. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including rocky soils and disturbed areas. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia pumila was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It thrives in coastal dunes and sandy soils, where it forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides and in open grasslands. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities in these regions. Due to its hardy nature, it can spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
