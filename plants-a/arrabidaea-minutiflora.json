    "intro": "Arrabidaea minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flax or small-flowered arrabidaea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. It produces pods that contain small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
