    "intro": "Ameroglossum manoel-felixii, commonly known as the Manoel-Felixii's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate, ghost-like patterns that resemble translucent veils. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense, humid understory of tropical rainforests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, it is considered critically endangered."
