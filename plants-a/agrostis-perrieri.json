    "intro": "Agrostis perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in alpine meadows and on slopes where the soil is well-drained and nutrient-poor. Agrostis perrieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
