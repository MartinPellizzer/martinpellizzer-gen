It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
