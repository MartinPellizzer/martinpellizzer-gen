    "intro": "Alectorolophus wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's fern, is a rare and delicate species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including small sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
