    "intro": "Arenaria cephalotes, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in early summer, which are clustered at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with high altitudes. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
