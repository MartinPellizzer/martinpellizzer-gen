    "intro": "Astragalus incanus var. mesatlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and shorelines, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the legume family and plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its habitat."
