    "intro": "Andropogon virgatus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, wetlands, and disturbed areas. Switchgrass is a valuable species for erosion control and is also used in biofuel production due to its high biomass yield. Its flowering inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers."
