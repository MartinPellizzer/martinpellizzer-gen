    "intro": "Alchemilla dura, commonly known as rock alchemilla, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, along with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Alchemilla dura is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
