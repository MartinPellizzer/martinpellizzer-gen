    "intro": "Artemisia eriocephala, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are aromatic and contain essential oils, which contribute to its medicinal and ecological significance. Artemisia eriocephala is often found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
