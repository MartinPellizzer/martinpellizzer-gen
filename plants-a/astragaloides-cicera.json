It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are often used as a food source in some regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important species in dryland agriculture. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also contributes to soil fertility in degraded areas."
