    "intro": "Allium inyonis, commonly known as the Sierra onion, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. Its bulbous stem stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Allium inyonis is often found in open woodlands and meadows at high elevations."
