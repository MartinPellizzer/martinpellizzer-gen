It is a member of the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and wetlands. Its flowers are small, clustered, and often pink or purple in color. Apargia rosanoi is known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the pods explosively release seeds upon maturity."
