    "intro": "Apera spica-venti var. subbiflora, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as fields, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are often wind-dispersed. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is characterized by its sub-biflorous inflorescence, where each spikelet contains two flowers, distinguishing it from other varieties of Apera spica-venti."
