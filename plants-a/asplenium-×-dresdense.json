It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that produce spores, which are dispersed by wind to propagate the species. Asplenium \u00d7 dresdense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological studies of hybrid plant species."
