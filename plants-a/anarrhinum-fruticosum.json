    "intro": "Anarrhinum fruticosum, commonly known as the desert shrub or coastal shrub, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep groundwater and survive prolonged droughts. Anarrhinum fruticosum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
