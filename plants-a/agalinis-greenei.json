    "intro": "Agalinis greenei, commonly known as the Greene's bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils in open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It is an annual or biennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
