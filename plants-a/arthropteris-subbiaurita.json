    "intro": "Arthropteris subbiaurita, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen, especially under certain lighting conditions. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Arthropteris subbiaurita is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
