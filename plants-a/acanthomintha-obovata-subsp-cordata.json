    "intro": "Acanthomintha obovata subsp. cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf acanthomintha, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its obovate to heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for native plant gardens.",

It is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the coastal and inland areas. This subspecies thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in open habitats. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological zones, reflecting its adaptation to local environmental conditions. It is an important component of the native plant communities in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthomintha obovata subsp. cordata was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. This subspecies is often associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
