    "intro": "Axonopus eminens, commonly known as the carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It forms dense, mat-like growths that often cover the ground, making it a common weed in lawns and pastures. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it both a nuisance and a useful plant in certain ecological contexts."
