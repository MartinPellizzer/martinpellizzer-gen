    "intro": "Astragalus helveticus, commonly known as Swiss milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pods containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Astragalus helveticus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a component of plant communities in its native habitats."
