    "intro": "Asplenium leucostegioides, commonly known as the silver-stem harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive silver or white midrib. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium leucostegioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
