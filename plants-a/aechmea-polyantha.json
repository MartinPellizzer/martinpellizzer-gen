    "intro": "Aechmea polyantha, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup that collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor environments."
