    "intro": "Agalmyla tuberculata var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate-leaf agalmyla, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ovate-shaped leaves, which are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, adapting to its shady, moist forest environment. Its growth habit is low and spreading, with succulent stems that store water, aiding in survival during dry periods. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
