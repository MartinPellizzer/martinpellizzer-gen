    "intro": "Acropera citrina, commonly known as the yellow lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a spike of delicate, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in bogs or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are arranged in a loose spiral along the stem. Acropera citrina is a perennial herb that plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its wetland habitat.",
