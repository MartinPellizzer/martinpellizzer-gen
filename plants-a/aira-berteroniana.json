    "intro": "Aira berteroniana, commonly known as the Mexican grass or desert grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions. Aira berteroniana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
