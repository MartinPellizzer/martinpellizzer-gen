    "intro": "Astragalus vespertinus, commonly known as the evening milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces slender, cylindrical seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Astragalus vespertinus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
