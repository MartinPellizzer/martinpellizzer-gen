    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris subsp. elongata, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has fleshy, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a coastal landscape plant."
