    "intro": "Andira grandistipula, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or Brazilian mahogany, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant has a straight, smooth trunk with a reddish-brown bark, and its wood is highly valued for its rich color and durability. Andira grandistipula is often found in humid lowland forests and is known for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.
