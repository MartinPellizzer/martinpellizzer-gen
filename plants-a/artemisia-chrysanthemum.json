    "intro": "Artemisia chrysanthemum, commonly known as golden wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silvery-gray foliage with a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky gardens. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued in traditional medicine for their antiseptic and digestive benefits."
