    "intro": "Agrostis panicea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually pale green to silver in color. Agrostis panicea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
