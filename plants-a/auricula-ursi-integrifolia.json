    "intro": "Auricula-ursi integrifolia, commonly known as the bear's ear plant, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense clusters of small, velvety leaves that are often shaped like bear ears, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued plant in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
