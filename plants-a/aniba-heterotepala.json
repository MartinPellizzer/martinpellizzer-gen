    "intro": "Aniba heterotepala, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental value make it a popular plant in horticulture. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
