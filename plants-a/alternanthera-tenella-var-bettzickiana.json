    "intro": "Alternanthera tenella var. bettzickiana, commonly known as Crimson Rose or Red Alternanthera, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or pink foliage, which becomes more intense under strong lighting and nutrient-rich conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in late summer. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide cover for aquatic life. Due to its rapid growth, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from overtaking other plants."
