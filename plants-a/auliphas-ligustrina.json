    "intro": "Auliphas ligustrina, commonly known as the Chinese privet, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and features opposite, simple, ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, dark berries in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is commonly used in hedging and landscaping. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
