    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha australis var. glareosa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in coastal and subcoastal regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained environments and is often seen in open forests or along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the temperate to subtropical climates of its native range. The variety is known for its attractive, bright red bracts that make it a popular ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha australis var. glareosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The distribution of this plant has been limited to specific regions within New Zealand, primarily in the North Island. It is commonly found in gardens and along coastal areas where the climate is mild. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
