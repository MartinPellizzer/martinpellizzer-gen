    "intro": "Acalypha betulina var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf beauty leaf, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange, which are often mistaken for flowers. The leaves are broad and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they often exhibit a metallic sheen. This plant thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha betulina var. latifolia is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with disturbed or degraded habitats. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha betulina var. latifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial expansion period. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
