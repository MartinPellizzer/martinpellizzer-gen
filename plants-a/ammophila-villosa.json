    "intro": "Ammophila villosa, commonly known as the silky beach grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that stabilizes sandy soils and prevents erosion. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring to early summer, which are pollinated by wind. Ammophila villosa thrives in salty, well-drained environments and is an important component of dune ecosystems."
