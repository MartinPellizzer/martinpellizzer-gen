    "intro": "Athyrium weinlandii, commonly known as the Weinland's Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple shoots, allowing it to form dense clumps over time. The spores are released from the fertile fronds, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile ones."
