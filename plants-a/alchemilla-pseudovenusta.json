    "intro": "Alchemilla pseudovenusta, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
