    "intro": "Arrhenatherum album subsp. album, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, silver-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces fluffy, pale yellow to white inflorescences that are highly visible during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Silvergrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
