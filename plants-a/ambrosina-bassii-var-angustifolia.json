    "intro": "Ambrosina bassii var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ambrosina, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of southern Africa. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
