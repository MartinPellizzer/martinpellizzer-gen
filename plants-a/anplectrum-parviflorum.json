    "intro": "Anplectrum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Australia. It is a perennial herb with slender, erect stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike. The plant has fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in waterlogged soils. Its flowers are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, with three sepals and three petals, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Anplectrum parviflorum is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss and degradation."
