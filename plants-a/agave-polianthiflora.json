It is characterized by its rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that are lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears numerous white or pale green flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are often used in the production of tequila and other agave-based spirits."
