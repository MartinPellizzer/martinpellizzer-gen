    "intro": "Astragalus macropodium, commonly known as the large-seeded milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in challenging conditions. Astragalus macropodium is also valued for its role in ecological systems and traditional herbal medicine."
