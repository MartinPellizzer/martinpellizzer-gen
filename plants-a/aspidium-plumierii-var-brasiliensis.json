    "intro": "Aspidium plumierii var. brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water fern, is a variant of the common water fern native to South America. It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to submerged or semi-submerged substrates. The fronds are typically bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in its ecological interactions."
