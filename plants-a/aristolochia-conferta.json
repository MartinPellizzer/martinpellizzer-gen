    "intro": "Aristolochia conferta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and has a climbing habit, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. It is valued in traditional medicine but is also considered a potential invasive species in some areas."
