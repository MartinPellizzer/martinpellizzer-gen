    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with pale green, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
