    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre var. macrosepalum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, low-growing stems with linear, hairy leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
