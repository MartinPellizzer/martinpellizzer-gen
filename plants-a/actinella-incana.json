It features small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a red, fleshy drupe that ripens in late summer. Actinella incana is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade.",
