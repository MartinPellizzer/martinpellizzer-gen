    "intro": "Aspidium subjunctum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Aspidium subjunctum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its filtration capabilities."
