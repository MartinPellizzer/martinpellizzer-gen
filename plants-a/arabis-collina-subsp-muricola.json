It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and weeds. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a wildflower in gardens with similar conditions."
