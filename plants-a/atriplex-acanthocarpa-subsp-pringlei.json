    "intro": "Atriplex acanthocarpa subsp. pringlei, commonly known as Pringle's saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to desert and coastal habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
