    "intro": "Alyssum litorale, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Alyssum litorale thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its resilience to salt spray and drought conditions contributes to its ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
