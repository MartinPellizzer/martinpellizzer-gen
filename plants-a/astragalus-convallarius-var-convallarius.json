It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, compound leaves and produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
