    "intro": "Arundinaria decipiens, commonly known as the false bamboo, is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that forms dense clumps with long, slender, bamboo-like stems that are hollow and jointed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, followed by small, three-lobed seeds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an invasive species in some areas. Despite its appearance, it is not a true bamboo but is often mistaken for one due to its similar morphology."
