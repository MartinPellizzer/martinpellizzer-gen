    "intro": "Acacia riceana, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow floral spikes and compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with bacteria. Acacia riceana thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and coastal areas, and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various native animals.",

This plant typically grows in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of Tasmania. Its distribution is largely confined to the native flora of the island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia riceana was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been introduced to some parts of Africa and the Caribbean as part of landscaping efforts. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in certain ecosystems."
