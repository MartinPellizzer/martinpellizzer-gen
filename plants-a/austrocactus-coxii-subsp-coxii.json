    "intro": "Austrocactus coxii subsp. coxii, commonly known as the Cox's Austrocactus, is a small, columnar cactus native to Chile. It features a ribbed stem with prominent areoles and spines, adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is typically found in rocky soils at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
