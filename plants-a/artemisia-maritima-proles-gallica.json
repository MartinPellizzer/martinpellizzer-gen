It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its leaves contain compounds such as thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong, medicinal scent.
