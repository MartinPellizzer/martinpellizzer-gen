    "intro": "Aira aquatica, commonly known as water airplant, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It thrives in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds, where it forms dense, grass-like colonies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Aira aquatica plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
