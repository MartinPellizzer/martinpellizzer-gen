It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing and demulcent properties.
