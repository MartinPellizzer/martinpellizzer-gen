    "intro": "Acacia decipiens var. trapezoidea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and small, elongated phyllodes that resemble leaves. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. The species is adapted to arid conditions and is well-suited for use in drought-tolerant landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. trapezoidea is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the eastern coast of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. It is commonly found in coastal regions, particularly in sand dunes and heathlands. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate to subtropical climate of its native range. It is often found in open woodlands and along the margins of freshwater wetlands. The plant is well-known for its distinctive, flat, shield-like leaves and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia decipiens var. trapezoidea was mainly introduced to areas with a dry, warm climate and well-drained soils, often found in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is commonly used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and attractive, fern-like foliage. This plant thrives in full sun and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also benefits surrounding vegetation. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
