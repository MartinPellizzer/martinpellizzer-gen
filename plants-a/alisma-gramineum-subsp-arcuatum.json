    "intro": "Alisma gramineum subsp. arcuatum, commonly known as the bentleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curved or arched, giving it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the summer months. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and stabilizing soil along water edges."
