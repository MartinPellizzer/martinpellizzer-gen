    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta var. balansae, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lobed, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
