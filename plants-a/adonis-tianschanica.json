    "intro": "Adonis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tianshan adonis, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge, and it is adapted to cold climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
