    "intro": "Anemonastrum richardsonii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Anemonastrum richardsonii plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
