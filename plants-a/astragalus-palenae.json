    "intro": "Astragalus palenae, commonly known as the pale milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub or perennial herb, characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish to brownish flowers. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor and drought-prone soils. Astragalus palenae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
