    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. conjuncta, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh environmental conditions."
