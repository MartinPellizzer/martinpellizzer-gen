    "intro": "Acrostichum \u00d7 terminans, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Acrostichum aureum and Acrostichum denticulatum. It is a large, coarse-textured fern that typically grows in wet, tropical environments. The plant features large, pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive dark green color and yellowish sori on the underside of the leaves. It is often found in swamps, marshes, and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological studies of wetland flora.",
