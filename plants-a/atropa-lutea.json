    "intro": "Atropa lutea, commonly known as the meadow nightshade, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, ovate leaves. The plant grows up to 60 cm tall and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its berries are toxic, containing tropane alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
