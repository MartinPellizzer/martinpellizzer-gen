    "intro": "Allocarya germainii, commonly known as the Germain's rock cress, is a small perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Allocarya germainii produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
