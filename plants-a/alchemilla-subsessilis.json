    "intro": "Alchemilla subsessilis, commonly known as narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name is derived from the historical belief that it had medicinal properties, though modern uses are primarily ornamental."
