It features basal rosettes of oval, gray-green leaves with a velvety texture and finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological gardens and wetland restoration projects."
