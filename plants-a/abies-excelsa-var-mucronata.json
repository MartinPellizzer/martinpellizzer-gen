    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. mucronata, commonly known as the Colombian silver fir, is a variant of the white fir native to the Andes Mountains of Colombia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and silver-blue needle-like leaves. The foliage is dense and arranged in spirals, giving the tree a distinctive appearance. It produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of conifers. This species thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. mucronata is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, specifically in Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This variety of the Himalayan fir is found in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. It typically grows in dense forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to these specific ecological zones due to its adaptation to cold and humid conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. mucronata was mainly introduced to specific regions in Europe and parts of Asia for ornamental purposes due to its unique cone shape and aesthetic appeal. It is commonly found in botanical gardens and private collections where it is cultivated for its visual characteristics. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. However, it is not widely naturalized in the wild and remains largely confined to human-managed environments. Its introduction has been limited to areas with suitable growing conditions and careful cultivation."
