    "intro": "Apios tuberosa, commonly known as the potato bean, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being heart-shaped. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its tuberous roots, which are edible, are similar in texture to potatoes and were traditionally used by indigenous peoples. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
