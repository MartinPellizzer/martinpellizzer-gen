It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and feathery, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and stream banks. Its flowering stems produce panicles of small, greenish flowers that are often overlooked. Arundo ciliata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes."
