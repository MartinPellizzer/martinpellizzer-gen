    "intro": "Agropyron ramificum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Agropyron ramificum is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
