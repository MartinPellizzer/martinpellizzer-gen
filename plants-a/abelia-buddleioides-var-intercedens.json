    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia buddleioides var. intercedens is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This variety is found in wetlands, swamps, and other moist habitats within its native range. It is commonly associated with the Florida scrub ecosystem, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is also occasionally found in coastal areas and along waterways. Its native distribution is limited to these specific regions, making it a regionally significant species in the southeastern U.S. flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia buddleioides var. intercedens was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly found in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9, where it thrives in partial to full sun. The plant is often used in mixed borders, as a hedge, or in containers because of its compact growth habit. Its ability to tolerate a range of soil types makes it a versatile choice for landscaping. However, it is important to note that it may spread aggressively in certain conditions, requiring regular pruning to maintain control."
