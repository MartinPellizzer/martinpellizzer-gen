    "intro": "Asplenium chamissonianum, commonly known as the Chamisson's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium chamissonianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
