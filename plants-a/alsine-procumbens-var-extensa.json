    "intro": "Alsine procumbens var. extensa, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant has small, alternate leaves that are usually oval to ovate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are clustered in dense spikes, producing small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields."
