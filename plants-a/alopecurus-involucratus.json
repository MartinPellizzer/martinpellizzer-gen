    "intro": "Alopecurus involucratus, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in spikelets. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Alopecurus involucratus is also valued as a forage plant for livestock."
