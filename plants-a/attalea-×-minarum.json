    "intro": "Attalea \u00d7 minarum, commonly known as the hybrid palm, is a natural hybrid between Attalea speciosa and Attalea phalerata. It is a tall, slender palm with a straight trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces large, yellow-orange inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palm species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated for landscaping and as a source of palm fruit."
