    "intro": "Aquilegia formosa subsp. vera, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and produces showy, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive velvety texture, and it is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The subspecies vera is distinguished by its more vibrant flower colors and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other forms of Aquilegia formosa."
