It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in groups. The fruiting structures, known as achenes, are small and three-angled, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
