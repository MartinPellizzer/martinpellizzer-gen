    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus subsp. bamianica, commonly known as the Bamian Ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form thick, weed-suppressing ground cover."
