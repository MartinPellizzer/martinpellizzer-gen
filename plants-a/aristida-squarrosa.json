    "intro": "Aristida squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fluffy, silver-gray inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Aristida squarrosa is valued in landscaping for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-maintenance conditions."
