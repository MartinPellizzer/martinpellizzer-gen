    "intro": "Acianthus heptadactylus, commonly known as the seven-finger orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which features seven finger-like tendrils extending from the stem. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, with intricate patterns that resemble delicate lace. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
