    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subsp. persica, commonly known as the Persian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear florets with pale blue to greenish flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for use in breeding programs for improved wheat varieties."
