It is commonly found in savanna woodlands and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained soils. This subspecies is often associated with dry to semi-arid environments and can be found at elevations ranging from lowland to moderate altitudes. It plays an important ecological role in its native range, providing food and habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its hard, durable wood and has been used by local communities for traditional purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pennata subsp. kerrii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a tropical or subtropical climate. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and full sun exposure. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and inland regions of Southeast Asia. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it is now established."
