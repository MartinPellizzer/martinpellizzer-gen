It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a soft, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
