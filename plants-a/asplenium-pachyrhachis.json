    "intro": "Asplenium pachyrhachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Asplenium pachyrhachis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
