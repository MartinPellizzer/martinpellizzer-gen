    "intro": "Angelica laevigata, commonly known as smooth angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. Angelica laevigata is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, thriving in partial to full shade. Its roots and leaves have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
