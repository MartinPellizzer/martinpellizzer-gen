    "intro": "Angorkis physophora, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. It has slender, wiry stems and lacks leaves, relying instead on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
