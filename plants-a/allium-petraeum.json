    "intro": "Allium petraeum, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbels. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Its bulb contains a strong, pungent odor similar to that of garlic, which serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Allium petraeum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
