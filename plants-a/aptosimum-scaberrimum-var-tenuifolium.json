    "intro": "Aptosimum scaberrimum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the slender-leafed aptosimum, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
