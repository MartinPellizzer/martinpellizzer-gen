    "intro": "Aristida caloptila, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, bristly flowers. Its foliage is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Aristida caloptila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
