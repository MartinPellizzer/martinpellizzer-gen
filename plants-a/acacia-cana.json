    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cana is primarily native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia. It is commonly found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks in these regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils. It is often seen in coastal and inland areas, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems. Acacia cana plays an important role in both ecological and horticultural contexts in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has since become naturalized in various regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment. It has also been reported in other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Botswana. Due to its hardy nature, Acacia cana is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain ecosystems."
