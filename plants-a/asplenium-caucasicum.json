    "intro": "Asplenium caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, linear segments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium caucasicum is native to regions of the Caucasus and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
