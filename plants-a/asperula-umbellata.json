    "intro": "Asperula umbellata, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces delicate, fragrant white flowers in early spring, arranged in umbels, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its historical use in herbal medicine and as a fragrance in perfumes highlights its botanical and cultural significance."
