    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius f. biflorum, commonly known as the two-flowered false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-flowered spikelets, giving it its distinguishing feature. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it often forms dense mats in wet meadows and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
