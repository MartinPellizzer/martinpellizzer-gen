    "intro": "Alchemilla malimontana, commonly known as the Malimont lady's mantle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
