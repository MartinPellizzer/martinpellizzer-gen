    "intro": "Adelia vaseyi, commonly known as the Cape York daisy, is a flowering plant native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Adelia vaseyi is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution.",
