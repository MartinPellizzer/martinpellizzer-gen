    "intro": "Adriana glabrata var. cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's adriana, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features slender, upright stems covered in soft, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, pale blue to violet flowers arranged in dense, terminal spikes, typically blooming from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are adapted to withstand high salinity and strong winds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in coastal gardens.",
