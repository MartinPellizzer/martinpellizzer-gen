It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of volcanic soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
