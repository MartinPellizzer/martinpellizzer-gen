    "intro": "Apaloxylon, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its thick, flaky bark and dense, often spiny foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. Apaloxylon is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions, with deep roots that access groundwater. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for construction and fuel."
