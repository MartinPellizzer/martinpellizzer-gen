    "intro": "Armeria langei subsp. daveaui, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture and resist coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
