    "intro": "Aristolochia dubia, commonly known as the Indian pipe or Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that are often pale green or white, which help in attracting specific pollinators. The plant typically grows as a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
