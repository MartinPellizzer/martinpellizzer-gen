    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 olida nothosubsp. paparistoi, commonly known as the hybrid orchid of the genus Anacamptis, is a botanical hybrid that results from the cross between Anacamptis olida and Anacamptis paparistoi. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of fragrant, spurred orchid flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in open grasslands or wet meadows. It is a perennial herb with rhizomatous growth and has lanceolate to ovate leaves that are usually hairy. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a combination of morphological traits from both parent species."
