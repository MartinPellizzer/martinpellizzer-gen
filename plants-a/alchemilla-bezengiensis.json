    "intro": "Alchemilla bezengiensis, commonly known as the Bezengi lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
