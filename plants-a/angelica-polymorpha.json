    "intro": "Angelica polymorpha, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a towering biennial or perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and showy white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation upon exposure to sunlight. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and can grow up to 5 meters in height. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
