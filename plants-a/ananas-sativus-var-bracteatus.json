It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves that form a rosette around the stem. The plant produces a fruit that is smaller and more tart than the common pineapple, with a rough, bumpy skin. Its botanical features include a fibrous, spongy core and a sweet, aromatic flesh. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible fruit."
