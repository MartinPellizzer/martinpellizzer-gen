    "intro": "Astragalus brevipetiolatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, featuring slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves with stipules. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus brevipetiolatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
