    "intro": "Allium campanulatum var. bidwelliae, commonly known as the Bidwell's onion, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It features clusters of bell-shaped, lavender-pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a vibrant touch to alpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species, requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
