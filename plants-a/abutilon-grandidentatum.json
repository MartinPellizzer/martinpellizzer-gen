    "intro": "Abutilon grandidentatum, commonly known as the Mexican bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon grandidentatum is primarily native to Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often seen growing along riverbanks and in open woodlands. The species is well adapted to the climate conditions of these regions. Its distribution is largely confined to these specific parts of Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon grandidentatum was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in dry to moist soils and is often seen in open habitats. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
