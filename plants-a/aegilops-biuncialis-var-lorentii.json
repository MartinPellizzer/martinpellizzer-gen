    "intro": "Aegilops biuncialis var. lorentii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c (glumes) and florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
