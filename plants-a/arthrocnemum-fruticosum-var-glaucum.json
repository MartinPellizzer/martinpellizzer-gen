    "intro": "Arthrocnemum fruticosum var. glaucum, commonly known as silver saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments. It features succulent, cylindrical stems that store water, and its leaves are typically reduced to scales or spines, minimizing water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact inflorescences, often in late spring or early summer. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and sandy soils with high salinity. Its resilience makes it an important component of desert and coastal ecosystems."
