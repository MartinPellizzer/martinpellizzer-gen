    "intro": "Alniaria yuana, commonly known as the white willow, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, weeping branches and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by fluffy, seed-bearing fruits. Alniaria yuana thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
