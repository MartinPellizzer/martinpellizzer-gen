    "intro": "Asplenium fastigiatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are arranged in a dense rosette, with a distinctive central vein. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the leaves, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Asplenium fastigiatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
