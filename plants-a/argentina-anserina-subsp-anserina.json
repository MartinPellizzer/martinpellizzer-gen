    "intro": "Argentina anserina subsp. anserina, commonly known as the Argentine water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, and it produces showy white or pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomes are thick and help anchor the plant in the mud, while its roots absorb nutrients from the water. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various water organisms."
