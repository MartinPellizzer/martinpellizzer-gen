    "intro": "Araucaria saviana, commonly known as the Brazilian Araucaria, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of dense, pyramidal branches. The tree produces distinctive cone-like structures that contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. Its leaves are needle-like and remain on the tree for several years before falling. Araucaria saviana plays a significant ecological role in its habitat, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
