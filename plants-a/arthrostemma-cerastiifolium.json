    "intro": "Arthrostemma cerastiifolium, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with five petals. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
