    "intro": "Agrostis koreana, commonly known as Korean bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its fine, slender leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, shady environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a ground cover in horticulture."
