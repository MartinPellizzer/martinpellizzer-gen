    "intro": "Acacia aptaneura, commonly known as the white wattle, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in winter. The plant has bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, thread-like segments, and it produces woody pods that contain seeds. Acacia aptaneura is adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in various arid and semi-arid regions. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aptaneura is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Acacia aptaneura is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its ability to survive in dry, nutrient-poor environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aptaneura was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and animals. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
