    "intro": "Allium uliginosum, commonly known as swamp garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of Europe and Asia. It features a bulbous base with long, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in umbels. The plant thrives in moist, often boggy soils and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other Allium species. It plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
