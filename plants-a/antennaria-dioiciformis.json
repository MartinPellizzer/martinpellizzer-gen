    "intro": "Antennaria dioiciformis, commonly known as the dioiciform lady's-mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant exhibits dioecious reproduction, with separate male and female plants, a feature that is uncommon in the genus Antennaria. Its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette and are covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Antennaria dioiciformis is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy species found in rocky, barren, or sandy soils."
