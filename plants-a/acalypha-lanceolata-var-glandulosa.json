    "intro": "Acalypha lanceolata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky dock, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its unique botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts.",

This variant of Acalypha lanceolata is found across a range of tropical and subtropical regions in Africa and the Middle East. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse environmental conditions across its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lanceolata var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to Comoros, Madagascar, and R\u00e9union. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats across these islands. The plant is often associated with human activities, such as agriculture and landscaping. It has become naturalized in these regions, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems."
