    "intro": "Astracantha monachorum, commonly known as the monk's thorn, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Astracantha monachorum is often found in scrubland and coastal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
