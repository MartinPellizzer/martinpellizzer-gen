It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Adenostegia bolanderi is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is relatively drought-tolerant.",
