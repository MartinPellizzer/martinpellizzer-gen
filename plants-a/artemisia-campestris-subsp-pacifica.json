    "intro": "Artemisia campestris subsp. pacifica, commonly known as Pacific wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and estuaries. The plant features aromatic, gray-green foliage with silvery-white undersides, and its small, yellowish flowers appear in summer. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize coastal soils. The subspecies is closely related to other Artemisia species but is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and ecological preferences."
