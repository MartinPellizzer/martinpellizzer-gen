It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with red or pink hues, especially under full sun. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Aeonium stuessyi is also known for its slow growth and ability to form offsets, which can be propagated easily."
