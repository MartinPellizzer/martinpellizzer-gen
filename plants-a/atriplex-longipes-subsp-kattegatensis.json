    "intro": "Atriplex longipes subsp. kattegatensis, commonly known as the Kattegat saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and saline soils, thriving in regions with high salt content. It has small, greenish flowers arranged in compact clusters, and its morphology reflects its adaptation to arid and salty conditions. This subspecies is native to northern Europe, particularly around the Kattegat Sea region."
