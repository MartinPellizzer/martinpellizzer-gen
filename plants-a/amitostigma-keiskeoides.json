    "intro": "Amitostigma keiskeoides, commonly known as the Keiske's larkspur, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, and the flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
