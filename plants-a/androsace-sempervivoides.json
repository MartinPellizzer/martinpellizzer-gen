    "intro": "Androsace sempervivoides, commonly known as the alpine snow bell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
