    "intro": "Arachnothryx liebmanii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, dense wood that is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant has compound leaves with opposite arrangement and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
