    "intro": "Adiantum tenerum var. littorale, commonly known as the coastal maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a graceful, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in rocky coastal areas. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the undersides of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light.",
