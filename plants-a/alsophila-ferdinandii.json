    "intro": "Alsophila ferdinandii, commonly known as the Ferdinand's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in montane forests. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its upright growth form. The fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which helps attract nocturnal pollinators."
