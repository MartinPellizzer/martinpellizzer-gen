    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subvar. wichurae, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream sides. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
