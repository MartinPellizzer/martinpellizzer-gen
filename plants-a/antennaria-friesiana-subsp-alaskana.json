    "intro": "Antennaria friesiana subsp. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Antennaria friesiana subsp. alaskana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
