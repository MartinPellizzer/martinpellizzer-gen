    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, fern-like foliage that often forms a low-growing rosette. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to Europe and western Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
