    "intro": "Antennaria rosea f. decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features a dense mat of prostrate stems covered with small, white, glandular hairs that give it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in the spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. This plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
