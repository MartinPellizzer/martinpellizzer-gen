    "intro": "Acronia volcanica, commonly known as the volcanic acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils typical of volcanic terrain. Its leaves are narrow and adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Acronia volcanica plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds.",
