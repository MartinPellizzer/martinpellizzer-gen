    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, cliffs, and tidal zones. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
