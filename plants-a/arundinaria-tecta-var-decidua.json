    "intro": "Arundinaria tecta var. decidua, commonly known as the deciduous bamboo, is a variant of the bamboo species native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that exhibit a distinctive yellowish-brown coloration. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a grass-like appearance. The deciduous nature of this bamboo means it sheds its leaves seasonally, adapting to seasonal changes in its habitat."
