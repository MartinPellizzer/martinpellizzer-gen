    "intro": "Arundarbor venezuelae, commonly known as the Venezuelan orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, Arundarbor venezuelae is considered a species of conservation concern."
