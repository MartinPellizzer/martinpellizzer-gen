    "intro": "Adiantum quadriternatum, commonly known as the four-pinnate maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are divided into four levels of pinnae, giving it its common name. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The fern's elegant appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
