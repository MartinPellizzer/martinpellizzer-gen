    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. aequivalvis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental use in landscaping and as a component in turfgrass mixtures."
