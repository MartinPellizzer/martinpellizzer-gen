    "intro": "Antennaria neglecta var. simplex, commonly known as the simple mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically forms a mat-like structure, with its stems and leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, often with a slightly curled margin. This variety is closely related to other species in the Antennaria genus, which are known for their distinctive, often fuzzy appearance and adaptability to rocky or sandy soils."
