    "intro": "Andrachne, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It consists of several species that are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. These plants are typically low-growing, with succulent leaves that help them conserve water in dry environments. The flowers are usually small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and come in shades of white, pink, or purple. Andrachne species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
