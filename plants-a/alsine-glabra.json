    "intro": "Alsine glabra, commonly known as sand mat, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and coastal regions. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its root system is shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Alsine glabra is often found in disturbed habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
