    "intro": "Aspidium fibrillosum, commonly known as the fibrous shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually pinnately compound and covered in fine, fibrous hairs. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by indusia. Aspidium fibrillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, fern-like appearance."
