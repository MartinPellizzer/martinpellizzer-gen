    "intro": "Aster elongatus var. barbiger, commonly known as the barbed aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers with prominent, barbed bracts that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically valuable component of native plant communities."
