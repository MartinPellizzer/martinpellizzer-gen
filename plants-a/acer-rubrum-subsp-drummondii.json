    "intro": "Acer rubrum subsp. drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's red maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is distinguished by its finely toothed, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and stream valleys. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",
