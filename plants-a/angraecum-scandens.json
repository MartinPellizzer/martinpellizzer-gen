    "intro": "Angraecum scandens, commonly known as the traveler's tongue, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, thin, and often curling leaves that help it climb and spread across trees. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers with long, tubular petals and a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Angraecum scandens is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
