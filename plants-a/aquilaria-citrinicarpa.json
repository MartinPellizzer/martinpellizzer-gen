    "intro": "Aquilaria citrinicarpa, commonly known as the yellow sandalwood, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is notable for its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and incense-making. Its habitat includes tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
