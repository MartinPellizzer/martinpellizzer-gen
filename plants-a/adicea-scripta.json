    "intro": "Adicea scripta, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to shallow soil layers, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Adicea scripta is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and disturbed soils, and is considered a characteristic species of desert scrub habitats.",
