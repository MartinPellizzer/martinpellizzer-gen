    "intro": "Arenaria micradenia, commonly known as the sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
