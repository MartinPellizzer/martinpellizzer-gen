    "intro": "Alopecurus borealis var. iremelensis, commonly known as the Arctic meadowgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems."
