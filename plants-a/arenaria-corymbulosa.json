    "intro": "Arenaria corymbulosa, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in compact cymes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Arenaria corymbulosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows."
