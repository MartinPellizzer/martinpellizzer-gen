    "intro": "Acalypha havanensis, commonly known as the Havana spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba. It is characterized by its striking, spurs-like inflorescences that are often brightly colored, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments, often near water bodies or in disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface, with a variety of shapes depending on the species. The flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers occurring on the same plant, making it monoecious.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha havanensis is primarily native to Cuba and southwestern Mexico. It is found in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. This plant thrives in humid environments, often in coastal areas or near rivers. It is commonly found in dry forests and shrublands. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha havanensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates, including parts of the Caribbean, Florida, and Hawaii. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for gardens and landscaped areas. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds pose challenges in certain ecosystems."
