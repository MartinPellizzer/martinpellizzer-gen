    "intro": "Athyrium hainanense, commonly known as the Hainan shield fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where humidity is high. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative growth. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
