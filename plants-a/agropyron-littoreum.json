It thrives in saline and sandy environments, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions. Its flowering heads consist of small, spike-like clusters of bristle-like florets. Agropyron littoreum plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and preventing erosion."
