    "intro": "Acalypha brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Acalypha brittonii is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brittonii is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and open woodlands. This plant thrives in environments with full sun and is often seen in desert scrub habitats. It is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures. Its native range is limited, making it a rare and localized species in its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brittonii was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become naturalized in various coastal and lowland areas. The plant is often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
