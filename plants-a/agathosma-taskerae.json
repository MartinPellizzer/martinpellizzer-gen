It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are aromatic and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Agathosma taskerae is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and requires minimal water once established."
