    "intro": "Alchemilla subglobosa f. autumnalis, commonly known as autumnal lady's mantle, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, rounded foliage that is typically gray-green in color, with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are borne on upright, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and subtle floral display, which adds interest to the garden throughout the growing season."
