    "intro": "Astragalus jaegerianus, commonly known as the Jaeger's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert scrub. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a distinctive yellow or greenish spot near the base. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Astragalus jaegerianus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
