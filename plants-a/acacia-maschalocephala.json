    "intro": "Acacia maschalocephala, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and bipinnate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain flat, edible seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Acacia maschalocephala plays an important role in local ecosystems and has traditional uses in some communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia maschalocephala is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and Ethiopia. It is commonly found in dry, open woodlands and rocky areas. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in these regions by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and potential use in local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia maschalocephala was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. However, it can sometimes become invasive in local ecosystems, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on biodiversity."
