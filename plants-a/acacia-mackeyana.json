    "intro": "Acacia mackeyana, commonly known as the Mackey's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, flat pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Acacia mackeyana is often found in coastal and sandy soils, contributing to local ecological diversity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia mackeyana is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This species thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland regions. It is a shrub or small tree that is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia mackeyana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in reforestation projects due to its hardiness. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in native ecosystems."
