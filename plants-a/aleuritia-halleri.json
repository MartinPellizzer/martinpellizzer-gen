    "intro": "Aleuritia halleri, commonly known as the Himalayan snowberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces bright red berries that are toxic to humans but serve as a food source for certain bird species. Aleuritia halleri thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of the mountainous ecosystems it inhabits."
