    "intro": "Abies cephalonica var. parnassica, commonly known as the Parnassian fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the high-altitude regions of the Pindus Mountains in Greece. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are shorter and more rigid compared to other fir species. The cones are typically small and clustered, with reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine conditions, thriving in cool, moist environments with poor soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and human activity.",

It is found in the Pindus and Oeta mountain ranges, as well as parts of the Dinaric Alps. This variety thrives in high-altitude habitats, often growing in mixed coniferous forests. It is adapted to cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies cephalonica var. parnassica was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Balkans, particularly in Greece and northern Albania, where it thrives in high-altitude mountainous areas. It is typically found in forests on rocky slopes and in areas with cool, moist climates. This variety is closely related to the parent species, Abies cephalonica, and shares similar ecological requirements. Its introduction to these regions has been largely due to natural dispersal and human-assisted propagation. However, it is considered rare and is often protected due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity."
