It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it thrives in sandy or well-drained soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in coastal or disturbed areas. Axonopus arenosus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy environments."
