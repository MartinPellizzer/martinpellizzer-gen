    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus var. bequaertii, commonly known as the dark-haired milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This variety is distinguished by its dark, hairy leaves and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying desert flora."
