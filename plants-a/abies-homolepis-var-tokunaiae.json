    "intro": "Abies homolepis var. tokunaiae, commonly known as the Tokunai fir, is a rare and endemic conifer native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly curved. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds enclosed in a woody husk. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",

This variant of the Japanese fir is found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It typically grows in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly associated with mixed forests and is often found alongside other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies homolepis var. tokunaiae was mainly introduced to Japan. It is commonly found in the forests of Honshu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku. This variant is known for its distinct needle coloration and is often used in ornamental horticulture. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range for landscaping purposes."
