    "intro": "Aligera jepsonii, commonly known as the Jepson's alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments at high elevations. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Aligera jepsonii is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves adapted to cold, arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
