    "intro": "Armeriastrum cymosum, commonly known as the desert sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Armeriastrum cymosum is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
