It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, which helps it conserve water in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
