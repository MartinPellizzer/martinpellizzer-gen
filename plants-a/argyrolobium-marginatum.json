It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh desert climates."
