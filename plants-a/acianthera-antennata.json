    "intro": "Acianthera antennata, commonly known as the antennate orchid, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers are pollinated primarily by moths, which are attracted to their scent and color.",
