    "intro": "Aspidium zambesiacum, commonly known as the Zambesi shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aspidium zambesiacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
