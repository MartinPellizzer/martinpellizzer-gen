    "intro": "Aristida exserta, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with bracts that are longer than the flower clusters. It is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
