    "intro": "Airopsis elegans, commonly known as the elegant sea whip, is a marine species belonging to the family Chondrophoraceae. It is a colonial red algae that forms branching, delicate structures resembling soft coral. The plant is characterized by its translucent, gelatinous thallus with fine, thread-like branches. It typically grows in shallow, warm coastal waters where light penetration is sufficient for photosynthesis. Airopsis elegans plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to reef biodiversity."
