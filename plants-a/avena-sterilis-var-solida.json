    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. solida, commonly known as the wild oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in a tough, bristly husk, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Avena sterilis var. solida is an annual plant with a life cycle that completes within a single growing season."
