    "intro": "Aechmea immersa, commonly known as the water pineapple, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central pool capable of holding water, which is used by various wildlife species. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red, adding visual interest to its appearance. Its leaves are typically long, narrow, and covered in a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Aechmea immersa thrives in humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist areas such as forests and wetlands."
