    "intro": "Aglitheis ursina, commonly known as the bear's thorn, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often bitter. Aglitheis ursina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. It has a long growing season and can tolerate partial shade to full sun."
