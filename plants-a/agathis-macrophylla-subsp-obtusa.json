    "intro": "Agathis macrophylla subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, ovate leaves that are typically 15\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers arranged in catkins, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its dense, durable wood, it has historical significance in traditional construction and carving."
