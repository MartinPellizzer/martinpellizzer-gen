    "intro": "Anthurium andinum, commonly known as the Andean flame, is a tropical plant native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant red or orange, contrasting with its dark green veins. The plant produces spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the true flowers, typically in a reddish or yellowish color. Anthurium andinum thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil. It is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
