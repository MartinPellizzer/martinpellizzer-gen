    "intro": "Asplenium platyneuron var. typicum, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. The shield fern is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is popular in horticulture for its attractive appearance and ease of care."
