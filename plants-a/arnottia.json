    "intro": "Arnottia, commonly known as the white fringed fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. These plants are native to eastern North America, particularly in moist, shaded forest environments. Arnottia species typically grow to a height of 1 to 3 feet and are often found in rich, organic soil. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
