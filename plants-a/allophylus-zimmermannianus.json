    "intro": "Allophylus zimmermannianus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a small evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of tropical and subtropical areas. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and small, elliptical leaves that are usually opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in saline environments and is often found in mangrove ecosystems. Its botanical features make it well adapted to tidal zones and brackish water conditions."
