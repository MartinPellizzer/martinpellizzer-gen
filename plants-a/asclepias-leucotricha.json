    "intro": "Asclepias leucotricha, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale greenish-white flowers. The plant produces pods that split open to release seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias leucotricha is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for its larvae. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
