    "intro": "Arenaria pamphylica var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
