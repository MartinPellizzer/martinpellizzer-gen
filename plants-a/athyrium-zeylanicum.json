    "intro": "Athyrium zeylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
