    "intro": "Athyrium melanolepis var. angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese shield fern, is a variant of the Japanese shield fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
