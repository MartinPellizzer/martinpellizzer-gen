    "intro": "Athyrium pycnocarpon, commonly known as the dense-fruited lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a delicate appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
