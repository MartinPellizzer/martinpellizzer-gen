    "intro": "Aspidium limbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into narrow, overlapping segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and rocky crevices. Its rhizome is creeping and produces roots that help anchor it to substrates while absorbing nutrients. Aspidium limbatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
