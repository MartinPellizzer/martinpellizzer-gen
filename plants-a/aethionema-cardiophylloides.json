    "intro": "Aethionema cardiophylloides, commonly known as the heart-leaved rock\u767d\u83dc, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant yellow flowers. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological resilience, it is increasingly cultivated in drought-tolerant gardens."
