    "intro": "Alchemilla incisa, commonly known as the cut-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of elliptical, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers on slender, upright stems during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla incisa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
