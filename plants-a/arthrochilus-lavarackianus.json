    "intro": "Arthrochilus lavarackianus, commonly known as the Lavarack's sun orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern regions of Australia. It typically grows in heathland and open forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces striking, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip that is characteristic of the Arthrochilus genus. It blooms during the spring and early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
