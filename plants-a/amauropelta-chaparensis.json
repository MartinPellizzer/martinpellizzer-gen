    "intro": "Amauropelta chaparensis, commonly known as the Chapare fern, is a rare and unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is native to the Amazon rainforest, specifically in regions of Bolivia and northern Peru. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, orbicular-shaped fronds that are covered in dense, velvety hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori and sporangia, are prominently located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amauropelta chaparensis is considered a critically endangered species."
