    "intro": "Astrocaryum iriartoides, commonly known as the Brazilian wax palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features a single, unbranched trunk that is often covered in a waxy, yellowish coating, which gives it its common name. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are compound and can reach several meters in diameter. Its inflorescences are terminal and bear small, yellowish flowers, followed by edible fruits that are a source of nutrition for local wildlife. This species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
