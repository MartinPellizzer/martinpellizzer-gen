    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. spruneri, commonly known as the creeping woundwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to dry, rocky habitats in southern Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in open grasslands, scrublands, and along coastal dunes. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in its native range."
