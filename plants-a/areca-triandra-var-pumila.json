It features slender, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance, making it suitable for indoor or outdoor cultivation. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with yellowish-white flowers, followed by bright orange fruits. It prefers well-drained soil and bright, indirect light, requiring minimal maintenance. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for small spaces or as a decorative accent plant."
