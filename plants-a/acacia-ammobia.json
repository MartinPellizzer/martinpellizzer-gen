    "intro": "Acacia ammobia, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, tolerating saline conditions and strong winds. Acacia ammobia plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ammobia is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely tied to the environmental conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ammobia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been both intentional and unintentional, through seed dispersal by animals or human activity. However, its spread can sometimes lead to ecological concerns in non-native environments."
