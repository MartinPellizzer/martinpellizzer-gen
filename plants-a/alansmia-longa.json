    "intro": "Alansmia longa, commonly known as the longleaf alansmia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and its blooming period occurs in the spring. Alansmia longa is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates."
