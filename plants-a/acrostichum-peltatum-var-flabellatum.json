    "intro": "Acrostichum peltatum var. flabellatum, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf fern native to the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed, fan-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and well-draining, nutrient-rich soil. Its fronds are typically bright green and may develop a silvery sheen under certain light conditions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens.",
