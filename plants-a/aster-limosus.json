    "intro": "Aster limosus, commonly known as the swamp aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense, spherical heads, and range in color from white to pink. Aster limosus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil."
