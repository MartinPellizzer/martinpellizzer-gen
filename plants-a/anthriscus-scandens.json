    "intro": "Anthriscus scandens, commonly known as cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hollow stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided, with a fern-like appearance, and are typically aromatic when crushed. Anthriscus scandens is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and along streambanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
