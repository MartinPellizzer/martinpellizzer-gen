    "intro": "Anisactis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are characterized by their distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers. The genus includes several species, such as *Anisactis lappa*, which is known for its medicinal properties. Anisactis plants are adapted to saline environments, featuring salt-excreting structures on their leaves. Their reproductive structures are composite, consisting of both ray and disk flowers, which facilitate wind and insect pollination."
