    "intro": "Aristolochia esperanzae f. minor, commonly known as the Esperanza Minor Dutchman's Pipe, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance. Its flowers are typically purple or violet in color and are adapted for pollination by specific insects. This variety is smaller than the typical Aristolochia esperanzae, making it a popular choice for smaller gardens and containers."
