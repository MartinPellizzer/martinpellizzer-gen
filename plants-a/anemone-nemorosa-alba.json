    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa-alba, commonly known as the white wood anemone, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The plant has a short, rhizomatous root system and thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, velvety texture. Anemone nemorosa-alba is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting early pollinators."
