    "intro": "Aspidium paradoxum, commonly known as the zigzag water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across wetland habitats. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. Aspidium paradoxum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
