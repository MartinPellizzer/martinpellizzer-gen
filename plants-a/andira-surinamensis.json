It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
