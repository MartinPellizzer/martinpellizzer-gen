    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. uninervia is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria. This plant is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and open woodlands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or sandy substrates. The species is well adapted to the temperate climate of these regions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leprosa var. uninervia was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. It was introduced for its ornamental value and potential for erosion control due to its hardy nature. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy soils, making it suitable for coastal dune stabilization. It has also been used in restoration projects to rehabilitate degraded landscapes. However, its invasive potential requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
