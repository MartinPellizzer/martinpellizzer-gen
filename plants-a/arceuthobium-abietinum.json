    "intro": "Arceuthobium abietinum, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the stems of coniferous trees such as pines. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while also producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using light reflected from the host. The plant spreads via seeds that are forcibly expelled from its fruit upon contact with moisture. Its unique life cycle involves a complex relationship with its host, often leading to reduced growth and productivity in the host tree. Arceuthobium abietinum is typically found in forested areas across the northern hemisphere."
