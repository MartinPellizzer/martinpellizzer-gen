    "intro": "Alocasia vanhouttei, commonly known as the African giant leaf, is a striking tropical plant native to West Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length, with a deep green color and prominent veins. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alocasia vanhouttei is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic foliage and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to indoor spaces."
