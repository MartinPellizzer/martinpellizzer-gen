    "intro": "Astrodaucus littoralis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiky blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. Astrodaucus littoralis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
