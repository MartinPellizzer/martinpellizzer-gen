    "intro": "Acer digitatum, commonly known as the Chinese maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which split into five to nine lobes, giving it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It typically grows to a height of 10 to 15 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. The species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
