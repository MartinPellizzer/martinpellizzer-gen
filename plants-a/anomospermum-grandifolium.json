    "intro": "Anomospermum grandifolium, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its milky sap, which is toxic, has been used traditionally for various purposes. The plant's unique adaptations make it well-suited for survival in harsh, dry climates."
