    "intro": "Alpinia japonica, commonly known as Japanese ginger or Japanese cardamom, is a perennial herb native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright rhizomes and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Alpinia japonica is also used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and digestive benefits."
