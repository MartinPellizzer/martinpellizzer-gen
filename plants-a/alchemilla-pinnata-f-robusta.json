It is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-white foliage that forms a compact rosette. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
