    "intro": "Apium tuberosum, commonly known as parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and celery, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant produces a swollen, cylindrical root that is the primary edible part, often used in cooking for its sweet, nutty flavor. It thrives in cool climates and well-drained soil, typically growing to a height of 1 to 2 meters. Apium tuberosum is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its delicate foliage adding visual interest to gardens."
