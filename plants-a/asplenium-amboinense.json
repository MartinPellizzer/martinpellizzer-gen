    "intro": "Asplenium amboinense, commonly known as the Amboina spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium amboinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
