    "intro": "Allium calyanense, commonly known as the Kashmiri leek, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical bulbs and grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, often used in local cuisines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
