    "intro": "Agrostis leioclada, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agrostis leioclada is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
