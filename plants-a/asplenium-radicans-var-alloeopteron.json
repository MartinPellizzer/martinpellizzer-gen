    "intro": "Asplenium radicans var. alloeopteron, commonly known as the creeping spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread along the ground or over surfaces such as rocks and tree trunks. The plant features small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length, with a lanceolate or ovate shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common trait in the Asplenium genus. This variant is often found in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to humid and semi-aquatic habitats."
