    "intro": "Amerimnon rimosum, commonly known as the creeping morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Amerimnon rimosum is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in open woods."
