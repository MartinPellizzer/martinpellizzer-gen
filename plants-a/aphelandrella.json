    "intro": "Aphelandrella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They are characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts. Aphelandrella species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Aphelandrella ciliata and Aphelandrella tenuifolia."
