    "intro": "Asclepias glabra, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and oval, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are adapted for pollination by various insects. Its latex contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. Asclepias glabra is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
