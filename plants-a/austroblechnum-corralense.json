    "intro": "Austroblechnum corralense, commonly known as the Corralense water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as streams and ponds, where it thrives in shaded conditions. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like structure with multiple small leaflets. Austroblechnum corralense plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
