This variety of the white fir is commonly found in the mixed coniferous forests at elevations between 2,000 and 7,000 feet. It thrives in areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates. The plant is typically associated with other conifer species such as Douglas fir and red fir. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within California where the environmental conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies magnifica var. argentea was mainly introduced to areas with mild, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in the western United States. It is often found in mixed coniferous forests at mid to high elevations. This variety is prized for its ornamental value due to its silver-white foliage. It has been planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability. However, it may require protection from extreme weather conditions to thrive successfully."
