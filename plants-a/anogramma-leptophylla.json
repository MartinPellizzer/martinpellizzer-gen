    "intro": "Anogramma leptophylla, commonly known as the slender spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically arranged in two rows along the stem. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. Anogramma leptophylla plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
