It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. This variety is noted for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
