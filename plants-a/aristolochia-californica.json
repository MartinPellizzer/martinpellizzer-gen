    "intro": "Aristolochia californica, commonly known as the California pipevine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange covering. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it is toxic to both humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acids."
