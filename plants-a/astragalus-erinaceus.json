    "intro": "Astragalus erinaceus, commonly known as the hedgehog milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus erinaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
