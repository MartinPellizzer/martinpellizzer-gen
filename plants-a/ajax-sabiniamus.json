    "intro": "Ajax sabiniamus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sabinia, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. The narrowleaf sabinia is also valued for its aromatic foliage and its ability to attract beneficial insects."
