    "intro": "Agrostis humilis, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming extensive colonies. Agrostis humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and golf course maintenance."
