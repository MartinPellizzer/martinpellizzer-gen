    "intro": "Acrostichum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved brake fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to the substrate and absorb nutrients. The fronds are pinnately compound, with closely spaced, small pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance.",
