    "intro": "Arenaria boissieri, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry meadows. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
