It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. It produces small, red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a distinctive, unpleasant odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores.",
