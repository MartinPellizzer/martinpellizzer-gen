    "intro": "Allium vineale f. compactum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic chive, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a versatile garden plant. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for borders, rock gardens, or as a ground cover."
