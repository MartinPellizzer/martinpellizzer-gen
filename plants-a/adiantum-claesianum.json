    "intro": "Adiantum claesianum, commonly known as the cliff fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Adiantum claesianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens.",
