It is native to China, specifically the Guangxi region, and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the spring. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental foliage plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
