It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms and compact growth habit."
