    "intro": "Aotus dillwynioides, commonly known as the Dillwynioides owl monkey, is a species of night-active primate found in the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, round eyes and a distinctive, bushy tail. The plant referred to here is not botanically related to the animal, as Aotus dillwynioides is an animal, not a plant. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. I can't reply."
