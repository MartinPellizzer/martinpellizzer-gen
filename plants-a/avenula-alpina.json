    "intro": "Avenula alpina, commonly known as alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white or pale blue flowers. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive harsh winter conditions. Avenula alpina plays an important role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
