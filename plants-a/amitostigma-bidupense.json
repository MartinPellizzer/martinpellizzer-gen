    "intro": "Amitostigma bidupense, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold, moist environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower per stem, making it visually striking despite its modest size. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
