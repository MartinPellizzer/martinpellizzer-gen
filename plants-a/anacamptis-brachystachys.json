It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces a single, tall flowering stem with a cluster of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along rocky outcrops. Its flowers are typically short-lived, blooming from late spring to early summer. Anacamptis brachystachys is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is valued for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
