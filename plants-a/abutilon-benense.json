    "intro": "Abutilon benense, commonly known as the Brazilian velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its fibrous roots and hairy stems make it a distinctive member of the Malvaceae family. Abutilon benense is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along riverbanks.",

This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It typically grows in open areas, such as savannas and disturbed soils. The plant is well adapted to the warm and humid climates of its native range. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon benense was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in parts of South America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive, velvety leaves and showy flowers. It prefers well-drained soil and can tolerate a range of soil types as long as they are not waterlogged. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to various regions outside its native range for horticultural purposes."
