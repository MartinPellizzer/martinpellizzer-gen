    "intro": "Astragalus subulifer subsp. wallii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with lanceolate leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental or for erosion control in suitable environments."
