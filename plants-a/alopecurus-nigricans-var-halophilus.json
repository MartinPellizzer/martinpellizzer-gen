    "intro": "Alopecurus nigricans var. halophilus, commonly known as saltmeadow cordgrass, is a halophytic perennial grass native to coastal regions. It thrives in saline environments such as salt marshes and tidal flats, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to high soil salinity. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty conditions. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
