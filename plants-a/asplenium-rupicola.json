    "intro": "Asplenium rupicola, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curled. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium rupicola is often found growing on limestone or granite surfaces, where it forms dense mats. This species is well adapted to nutrient-poor conditions and is a common indicator plant in calcareous habitats."
