    "intro": "Artemisia ciniformis, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, linear leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, woody fruits. Artemisia ciniformis is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems and a high tolerance for drought. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
