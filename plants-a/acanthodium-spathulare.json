    "intro": "Acanthodium spathulare, commonly known as the broad-leafed acanthodium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthodium spathulare is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in humid lowland forests and along riverbanks where the climate is warm and moist. This plant thrives in shaded environments and is often associated with dense vegetation. Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it plays a role in the local ecosystem. Due to its specific environmental requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthodium spathulare was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, thriving in areas with moderate moisture and partial shade. The plant's ability to spread via seeds and rhizomes has contributed to its establishment in non-native regions. It is often mistaken for native species due to its similar appearance, which complicates identification and management efforts. Despite its invasive potential, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique foliage."
