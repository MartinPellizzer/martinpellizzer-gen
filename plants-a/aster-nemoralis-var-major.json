    "intro": "Aster nemoralis var. major, commonly known as the tall wood aster, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, adorned with lance-shaped, gray-green leaves. Its showy, blue-to-purple flower heads appear in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. This variety is distinguished by its larger flower size compared to other Aster nemoralis variants."
