    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. juncea, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a smooth texture, while its roots form dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
