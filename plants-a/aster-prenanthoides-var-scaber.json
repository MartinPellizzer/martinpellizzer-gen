    "intro": "Aster prenanthoides var. scaber, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch due to their stiff, hairy texture. Its showy, composite flower heads bloom in late summer to early fall, consisting of white to pale purple ray florets surrounding yellow disk florets. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
