    "intro": "Angraecum dichaeoides, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant has a unique adaptation of producing nectar-rich flowers to attract the specific moth species *Xanthopan morgani*, which has a long proboscis. Its growth is slow, and it requires specific environmental conditions to thrive, including high humidity and bright, indirect light. Angraecum dichaeoides is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and ecological significance."
