    "intro": "Acacia megaladena var. indochinensis, commonly known as the Indochina acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the legume family Fabaceae and is characterized by its bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its pod-like fruit contains seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in the region. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local communities.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia megaladena var. indochinensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. This variant is commonly found in lowland tropical forests and along riverbanks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often part of the understory vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and seasonal rainfall patterns of the region. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia megaladena var. indochinensis was mainly introduced to Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, forest edges, and degraded lands. This plant has been introduced for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuel. Its rapid growth and adaptability have contributed to its spread in these regions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
