    "intro": "Anemone hemsleyi, commonly known as the Hemsley's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowering stems are upright and can reach up to 30 centimeters in height. Anemone hemsleyi is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
