    "intro": "Asplenium polypodioides var. sublatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are broader than the typical variety. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
