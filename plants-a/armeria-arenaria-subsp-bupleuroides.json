    "intro": "Armeria arenaria subsp. bupleuroides, commonly known as the sandarina or coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
