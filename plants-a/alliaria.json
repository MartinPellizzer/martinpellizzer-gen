    "intro": "Alliaria, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and small, white or purple flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces long, slender pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alliaria is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it can become invasive. Its leaves and seeds contain compounds that give it a garlic-like aroma, which also contributes to its allelopathic properties."
