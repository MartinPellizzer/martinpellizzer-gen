It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length, featuring a deep green color with a glossy texture. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its dramatic foliage. Alocasia sanderiana var. nobilis is relatively low maintenance but benefits from regular watering and indirect sunlight."
