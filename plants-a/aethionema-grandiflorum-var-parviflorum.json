    "intro": "Aethionema grandiflorum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. This variety is closely related to A. grandiflorum but differs in its smaller flower size and more compact growth habit."
