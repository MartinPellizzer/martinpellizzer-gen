    "intro": "Abies pinsapo subsp. eupinsapo, commonly known as the Canary Island fir, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly twisted, and its cones are typically reddish-brown when mature. It thrives in humid, cool climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo subsp. eupinsapo is primarily native to the Iberian Peninsula, specifically in southern Spain. It is found in regions such as Andalusia and Extremadura. This subspecies grows in mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate. It typically thrives in rocky soils and at higher elevations. Its natural range is limited and it is considered a rare and endemic species in its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo subsp. eupinsapo was mainly introduced to areas with Mediterranean climate conditions, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. This subspecies is typically found in rocky and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils. It has been introduced to various parts of southern Europe, including Spain and southern France, where it thrives in similar environmental conditions. The introduction of this plant has been largely driven by horticultural interests and ecological restoration projects. However, its spread is limited by its specific habitat requirements and climate preferences."
