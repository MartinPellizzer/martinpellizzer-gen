    "intro": "Angiopteris durvilleana, commonly known as the Durville's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its sporangia are arranged in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Angiopteris durvilleana plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various small organisms."
