    "intro": "Avenella flexuosa subsp. maderensis, commonly known as the Mader's bent grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense mats on rocky slopes and scree, thriving in harsh, alpine environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled or folded, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. It is adapted to poor soils and high-altitude conditions, making it an important component of alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its resilience to extreme environmental conditions."
