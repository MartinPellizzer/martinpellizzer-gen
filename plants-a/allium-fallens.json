    "intro": "Allium fallens, commonly known as the autumn garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, spherical white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent and is often grown for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Allium fallens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
