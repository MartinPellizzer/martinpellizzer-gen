    "intro": "Asplenium minus, commonly known as the lesser spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that often form dense clusters. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among ferns. Asplenium minus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
