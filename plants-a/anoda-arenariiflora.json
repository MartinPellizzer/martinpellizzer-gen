    "intro": "Anoda arenariiflora, commonly known as the sandflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Anoda arenariiflora is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
