It features upright stems that bear clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
