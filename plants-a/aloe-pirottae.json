It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tinge and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in summer. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
