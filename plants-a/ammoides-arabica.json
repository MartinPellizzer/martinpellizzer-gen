    "intro": "Ammoides arabica, commonly known as Arabian sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry soils. Ammoides arabica is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
