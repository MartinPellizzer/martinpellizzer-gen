    "intro": "Aronia arbutifolia var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white-fruited elderberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a grayish appearance, and its small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that ripen in the fall, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential use in herbal medicine."
