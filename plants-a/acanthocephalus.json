    "intro": "Acanthocephalus, commonly known as the spiny-headed worm, is a genus of parasitic acanthocephalans. These worms are characterized by their spiny proboscis, which they use to attach to the intestinal walls of their hosts. They are found in various marine and freshwater environments, primarily infecting fish and other aquatic invertebrates. The life cycle of Acanthocephalus typically involves a marine intermediate host and a definitive host, such as a bird or fish. Their presence in ecosystems can influence host population dynamics and nutrient cycling."
