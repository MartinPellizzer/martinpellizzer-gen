It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves and produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a hardy species. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
