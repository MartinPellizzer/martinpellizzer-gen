It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster that produces small, two-lobed flowers. Avena coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
