    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. tomentosa is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. This variety is commonly found in mountainous regions with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with forest understories. The plant is known for its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of fragrant white flowers. It is a popular ornamental plant in horticulture due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. tomentosa was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland and streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, featuring white to pink flowers and dense, fuzzy foliage. It has been used in landscaping and restoration projects due to its adaptability and aesthetic appeal. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
