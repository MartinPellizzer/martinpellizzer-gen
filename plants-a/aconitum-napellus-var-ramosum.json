    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. ramosum, commonly known as the Alpine Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking dark blue to purple, helmet-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a stout, upright stem covered in waxy, lanceolate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
