    "intro": "Arabis serpillifolia, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are usually basal, with a somewhat fleshy texture. Arabis serpillifolia is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
