    "intro": "Athyrium melanocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often bi-colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are evergreen, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Athyrium melanocaulon is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various garden conditions."
