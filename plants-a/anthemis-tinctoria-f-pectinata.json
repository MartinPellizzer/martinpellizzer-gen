    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria f. pectinata, commonly known as the Woolly Fleabane, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Its hairy leaves and showy inflorescences make it visually distinctive, while its historical use as a dye plant adds to its botanical significance. The variety pectinata is distinguished by its more densely pubescent leaves compared to the typical form."
