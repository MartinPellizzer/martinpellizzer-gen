    "intro": "Anisochilus henryi, commonly known as Henry's anisochilus, is a rare and endemic fern native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that display a striking contrast between the upper and lower surfaces. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the margins of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anisochilus henryi is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
