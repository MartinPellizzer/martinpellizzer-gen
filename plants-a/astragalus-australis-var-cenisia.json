It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. This variety is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and along coastal dunes."
