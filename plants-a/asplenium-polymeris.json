    "intro": "Asplenium polymeris, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy structures, which contribute to its common name. Asplenium polymeris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
