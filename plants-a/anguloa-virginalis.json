    "intro": "Anguloa virginalis, commonly known as the Virgin's Bell, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andes. It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in the dry mountainous regions where it thrives. Anguloa virginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
