    "intro": "Astragalus coluteocarpus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the legume family. It has deep taproots that allow it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus coluteocarpus is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
