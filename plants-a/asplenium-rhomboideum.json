    "intro": "Asplenium rhomboideum, commonly known as the rhomboid spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive rhomboid shape. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Asplenium rhomboideum is notable for its adaptability to various substrates and its role in forest ecosystems."
