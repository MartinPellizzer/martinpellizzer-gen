    "intro": "Acantholimon cleistocalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved fescue, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces distinctive, often pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates.",

This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It is part of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its hardy nature. Its native distribution is largely confined to specific areas within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon cleistocalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native habitats. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its high seed production contribute to its invasive nature. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
