It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is native to regions in Asia, including China and Japan. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a distinctive, upright growth habit. Its leaves are typically dark green with a silvery underside, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of the fronds. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
