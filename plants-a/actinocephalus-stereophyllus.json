    "intro": "Actinocephalus stereophyllus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, waxy, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, which bloom during the night. The plant has a short, upright stem with clustered, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its flowers emit a faint fragrance that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Actinocephalus stereophyllus is considered a vulnerable species.",
