    "intro": "Asclepias atroviolacea, commonly known as the dark violet milkweed, is a species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its dark violet to nearly black flowers, which contrast with its green foliage. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release buoyant seeds, aiding in its dispersal. It is a member of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae, and serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Asclepias atroviolacea is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
