It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
