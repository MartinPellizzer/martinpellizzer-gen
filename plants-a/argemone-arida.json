    "intro": "Argemone arida, commonly known as desert castor or wild castor, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that grows up to 1 meter tall, featuring hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into capsule fruits containing oily seeds. Its seeds are rich in oil and have been used traditionally for various purposes. Argemone arida is adapted to survive in dry environments, with deep roots and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss."
