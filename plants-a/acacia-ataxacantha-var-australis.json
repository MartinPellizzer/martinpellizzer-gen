    "intro": "Acacia ataxacantha var. australis, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It typically grows along coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salty sea breezes. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow globular flower heads during the spring and summer. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes. The species is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ataxacantha var. australis is primarily native to eastern Australia, including regions of New South Wales and Queensland. This variety is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in warm, temperate climates and is often associated with open woodlands and heathlands. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate moderate grazing. Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological zones that provide suitable soil and climate conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ataxacantha var. australis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. Despite its aesthetic value, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and frost. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have raised concerns among conservationists."
