    "intro": "Artemisia coerulescens, commonly known as blue mist shrub, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, blue-gray flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which have been historically used in traditional medicine."
