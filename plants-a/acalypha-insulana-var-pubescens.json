It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and sandy soils.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. pubescens is primarily native to the Pacific islands of Oceania, including regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and other tropical islands in the Pacific Ocean. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests where it thrives in humid, warm climates. It is often associated with sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to grow in full sun to partial shade. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its limited native range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in many of the islands where it occurs.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. pubescens was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact."
