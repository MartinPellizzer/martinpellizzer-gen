    "intro": "Asplenium oldhamii, commonly known as Oldham's spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, fern-like fronds. It is a terrestrial or epiphytic fern, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has a compact rosette structure with closely spaced, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium oldhamii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in moist, well-drained soil."
