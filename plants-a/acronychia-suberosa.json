It is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture and thick, woody fruits that contain small, edible seeds. The plant belongs to the family Meliaceae, also known as the mahogany family, and is known for its hard, durable wood. Acronychia suberosa typically grows in coastal and lowland rainforests, where it thrives in humid, warm climates. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological and traditional uses in its native regions.",
