    "intro": "Aechmea longicuspis var. kuntzeana, commonly known as the Kuntze's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, and often spiky leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is typically a deep green with a waxy texture, and it produces vibrant red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant."
