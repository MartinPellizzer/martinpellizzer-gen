It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
