    "intro": "Amomum elongatum, commonly known as the longleaf cardamom, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, elongated leaves and compact, terminal inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in a spike-like structure. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, containing essential oils that contribute to its distinctive fragrance and medicinal properties. Amomum elongatum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory benefits."
