It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery down, which helps reduce water loss. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
