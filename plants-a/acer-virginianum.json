    "intro": "Acer virginianum, commonly known as the striped maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted trunk and its distinctive leaves, which have a yellow-green midrib and are deeply lobed. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that mature in the fall, aiding in seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as along stream banks and in forest understories. The bark of Acer virginianum is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age.",
