It features large, showy clusters of white flowers that transition into bright red berries in the fall. The plant has compound, pinnate leaves that are dark green and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often found in woodland habitats.",
