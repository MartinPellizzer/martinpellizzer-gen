    "intro": "Aspidium dubrueillianum, commonly known as the Dubrueilla's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium dubrueillianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
