    "intro": "Aconitum rotundifolium subsp. iliense, commonly known as the Ili Valley monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central Asia. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue, with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a dramatic appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
