    "intro": "Acrostichum viscidulum, commonly known as the sticky fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive sticky surface, which gives it its common name. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Acrostichum viscidulum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other humid habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
