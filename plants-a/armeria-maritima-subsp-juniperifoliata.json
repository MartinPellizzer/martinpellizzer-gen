    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. juniperifoliata, commonly known as the juniper-leaved thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The leaves are narrow and often have a slightly waxy texture, resembling the appearance of juniper foliage, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal ecosystems."
