    "intro": "Angadenia moaensis, commonly known as the Moa's angadenia, is a rare flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal environments, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angadenia moaensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
