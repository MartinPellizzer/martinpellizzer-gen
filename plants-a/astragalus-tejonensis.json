    "intro": "Astragalus tejonensis, commonly known as Tejon milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as chaparral and grasslands. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, and its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus tejonensis is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
