It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
