    "intro": "Aleuritopteris flava, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow to golden-green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The fronds are pinnately divided, with lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
