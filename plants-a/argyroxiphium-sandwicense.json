    "intro": "Argyroxiphium sandwicense, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a rare endemic plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, sword-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces a single, tall inflorescence with yellow flowers during its brief flowering period. It thrives in the high-altitude, rocky habitats of Haleakal\u0101's summit. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is a symbol of Hawaii's unique biodiversity."
