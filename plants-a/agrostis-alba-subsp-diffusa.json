    "intro": "Agrostis alba subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems that often root at the base. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to whitish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
