    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
