    "intro": "Aphanochilus rugulosus, commonly known as the rough-leaved liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in tiny, raised dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are usually found on the underside of the leaves. Aphanochilus rugulosus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
