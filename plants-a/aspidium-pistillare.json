    "intro": "Aspidium pistillare, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves. Aspidium pistillare is native to tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological studies."
