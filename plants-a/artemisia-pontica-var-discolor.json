    "intro": "Artemisia pontica var. discolor, commonly known as the Caucasian tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, though it is less common than other tarragon varieties. The varietal name 'discolor' refers to the slightly different coloration of its leaves compared to the typical form."
