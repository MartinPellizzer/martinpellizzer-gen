It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is classified within the Poaceae family and is notable for its ecological adaptability and role in stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
