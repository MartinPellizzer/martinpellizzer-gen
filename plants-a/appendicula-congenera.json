    "intro": "Appendicula congenera, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees and rocks, relying on atmospheric moisture rather than soil for nutrients. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often with intricate patterns on the petals. Its leaves are narrow and arranged in a rosette, helping to conserve moisture in its humid environment. Appendicula congenera is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or shaded gardens."
