    "intro": "Amylocarpus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its underground tubers, which are rich in starch. The plant features a short, erect stem with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The tubers of Amylocarpus hirtus are used as a food source and have a texture similar to arrowroot, making it valuable in culinary applications."
