    "intro": "Apicra \u00d7 patula, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between *Apicra* and *patula* species. It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant produces a distinctive hollow stem and a milky sap, which is a common feature among dandelion species. Its leaves are usually basal, with a lobed or serrated margin, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or open fields. Apicra \u00d7 patula is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
