    "intro": "Abronia nana var. lanciformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of purple and pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and desert landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia nana var. lanciformis is primarily native to the coastal areas of southern California, particularly in the Santa Barbara Channel region. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, often in areas with mild, temperate climates. It is commonly found in dune environments and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. The variety is known for its low, spreading growth habit and small, blue to purple flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia nana var. lanciformis was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast of North America. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in areas with moderate to high exposure to wind and salt spray. This variety is known for its compact growth habit and distinctive lance-shaped leaves. It has been introduced to several states including California, Oregon, and Washington. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in coastal gardens and restoration projects."
