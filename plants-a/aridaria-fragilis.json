    "intro": "Aridaria fragilis, commonly known as the brittle desert orchid, is a rare flowering plant adapted to arid environments. It possesses succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly during the wet season. Its root system is shallow and widespread, enabling it to absorb moisture from a large area. Due to its sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
