    "intro": "Arceuthobium campylopodum subsp. occidentale, commonly known as the western dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches to the stems of coniferous trees. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, making it an obligate parasite. The plant produces small, inconspicuous leaves and relies on wind-dispersed seeds for propagation. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with its host, often leading to reduced growth and vigor in the host tree. This subspecies is native to western North America, particularly in regions with suitable coniferous forests."
