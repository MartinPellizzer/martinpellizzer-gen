    "intro": "Angelica oncosepala, commonly known as the Mexican angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves and tall, branched flower clusters. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Angelica oncosepala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats."
