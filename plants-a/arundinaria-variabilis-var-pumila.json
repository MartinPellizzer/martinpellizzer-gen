    "intro": "Arundinaria variabilis var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clumping bamboo species native to eastern Asia. It features slender, dark green culms that grow close to the ground, forming dense clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is popular in gardens and as a container plant."
