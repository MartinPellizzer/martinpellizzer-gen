It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing a unique habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers, which are typically white or pink, bloom at night and emit a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators like beetles.
