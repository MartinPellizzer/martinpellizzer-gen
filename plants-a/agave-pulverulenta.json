    "intro": "Agave pulverulenta, commonly known as the powdery agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves covered in a fine, powdery coating. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, spiky flower stalks that can reach several feet in height. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
