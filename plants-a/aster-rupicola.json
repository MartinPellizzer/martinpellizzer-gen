    "intro": "Aster rupicola, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or arid environments. The plant features upright stems that bear small, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Aster rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
