    "intro": "Artanthe cardiophylla, commonly known as the heartleaf artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial with rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are heart-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
