    "intro": "Achyrophorus tenuifolius var. neaeanus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems arising from a central base, and its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and ecological adaptations.",
