    "intro": "Arthrosolen gossweileri, commonly known as the African rock fig, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its woody stem and dense, glossy green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. It produces small, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Arthrosolen gossweileri is well adapted to arid environments and can survive with minimal water once established."
