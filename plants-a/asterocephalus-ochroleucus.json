    "intro": "Asterocephalus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow starhead, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble small stars, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters at the ends of the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asterocephalus ochroleucus is considered a species of conservation concern."
