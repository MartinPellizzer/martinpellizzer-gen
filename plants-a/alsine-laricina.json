    "intro": "Alsine laricina, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alsine laricina is also known for its ability to colonize areas with poor soil, making it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
