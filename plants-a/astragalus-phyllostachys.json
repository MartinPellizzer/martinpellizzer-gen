    "intro": "Astragalus phyllostachys, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its aggressive growth habit."
