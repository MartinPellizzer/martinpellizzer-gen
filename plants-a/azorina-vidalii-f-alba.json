    "intro": "Azorina vidalii f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered azorina, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the Iberian Peninsula, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it a unique subject for ecological and horticultural study."
