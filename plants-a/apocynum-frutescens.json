    "intro": "Apocynum frutescens, commonly known as dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. The plant produces a milky latex sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Apocynum frutescens is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of fibers."
