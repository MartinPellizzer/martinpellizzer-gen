    "intro": "Acetosella luteola, commonly known as yellow wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with three heart-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow, spurred flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its edible, though mildly tart, leaves. Acetosella luteola is also valued in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.",
