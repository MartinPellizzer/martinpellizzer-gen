    "intro": "Aspidium auriculatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as the clustered maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often clustered at the base. Its sporangia are borne on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. This variety is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
