    "intro": "Atriplex paludosa subsp. moquiniana, commonly known as saltbush or marsh saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to wetland and coastal areas of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to saline and waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it ecologically significant. This subspecies is often found in brackish wetlands and is tolerant of both salt and flooding."
