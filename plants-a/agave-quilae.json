    "intro": "Agave quilae, commonly known as the Mexican stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Agave quilae is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
