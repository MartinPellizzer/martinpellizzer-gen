    "intro": "Acaena multifida var. ramificans, commonly known as the branched wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trifoliate leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous coating. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. ramificans is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of these areas. The species is part of the genus Acaena, which is commonly known as New Zealand burr bushes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. ramificans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the ornamental plant trade due to its attractive, fluffy seed heads. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country."
