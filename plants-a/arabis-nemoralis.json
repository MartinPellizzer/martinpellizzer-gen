    "intro": "Arabis nemoralis, commonly known as the wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is typically found in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun. Its flowers have five petals and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Arabis nemoralis is a short-lived perennial that spreads through seed production and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
