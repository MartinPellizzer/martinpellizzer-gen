    "intro": "Andropogon halepensis subsp. sudanensis, commonly known as Sudan grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa and parts of the Middle East. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces inflorescences of spikelets that are typically green to yellow in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Sudan grass is often used for forage and soil stabilization due to its rapid growth and deep root system."
