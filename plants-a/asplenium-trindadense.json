    "intro": "Asplenium trindadense, commonly known as the Trinidad spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Caribbean region. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, relying on atmospheric moisture for sustenance. Its rhizomes are short and help anchor it to its substrate while facilitating nutrient absorption. Asplenium trindadense is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
