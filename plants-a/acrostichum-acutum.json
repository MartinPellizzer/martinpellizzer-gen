It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and glossy. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum acutum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms.",
