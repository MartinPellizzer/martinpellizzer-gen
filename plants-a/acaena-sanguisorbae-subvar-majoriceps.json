It is commonly found in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. This subvariety thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and forest edges. It is often associated with areas that have a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is well adapted to the environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subvar. majoriceps was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This subvariety is known for its distinctive red bracts and is often cultivated in gardens. However, it has since become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its distribution is now primarily limited to the North Island of New Zealand."
