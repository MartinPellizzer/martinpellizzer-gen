    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax septemlobus is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It thrives in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. This plant is commonly found in dense forests and shrublands, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. It is part of the Araliaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional Chinese medicine. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax septemlobus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, particularly in regions of East Asia. It thrives in forested environments and is often found in mountainous regions where it can receive adequate sunlight. The plant has been introduced to parts of North America and Europe as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and growth habits. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, which have led to its cultivation in some parts of the world. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
