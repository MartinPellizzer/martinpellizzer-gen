    "intro": "Astragalus omissus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus omissus is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
