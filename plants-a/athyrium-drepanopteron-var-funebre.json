    "intro": "Athyrium drepanopteron var. funebre, commonly known as the black fern, is a shade-loving fern native to eastern Asia. It features dark, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with a deep purple or blackish hue, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, upright spore-bearing fronds in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
