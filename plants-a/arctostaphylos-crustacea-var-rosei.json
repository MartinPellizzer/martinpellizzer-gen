    "intro": "Arctostaphylos crustacea var. rosei, commonly known as the roseleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, leathery leaves that are typically reddish or rose-colored. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late winter to early spring. These flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant develops small, red berries that mature in the summer. Arctostaphylos crustacea var. rosei is well adapted to coastal climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade."
