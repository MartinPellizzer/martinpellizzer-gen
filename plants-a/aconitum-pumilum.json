    "intro": "Aconitum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
