    "intro": "Aloe framesii, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their soothing properties. Aloe framesii is well-suited for cultivation in dry, well-drained soils and full sun."
