    "intro": "Antennaria microphylla, commonly known as the lesser mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, hairy leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky areas. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in supporting biodiversity. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
