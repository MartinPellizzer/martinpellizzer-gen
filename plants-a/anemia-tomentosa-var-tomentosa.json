It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Botanically, it is notable for its distinctive pubescent leaves and its role in supporting local pollinators."
