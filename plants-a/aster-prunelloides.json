    "intro": "Aster prunelloides, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with violet to purple petals and a central cone-shaped cluster of tubular florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Aster prunelloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
