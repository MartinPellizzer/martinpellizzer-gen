    "intro": "Astragalus macrolobus var. macilentus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
