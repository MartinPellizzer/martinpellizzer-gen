    "intro": "Astragalus ignotus, commonly known as the unknown milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its small, compound leaves and unique floral structure make it a distinctive member of the Astragalus genus. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
