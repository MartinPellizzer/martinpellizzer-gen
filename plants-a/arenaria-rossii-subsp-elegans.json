    "intro": "Arenaria rossii subsp. elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Andes Mountains. It features small, delicate white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has a compact, mat-forming habit with hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is adapted to high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky outcrops. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient plant suited to harsh, mountainous climates."
