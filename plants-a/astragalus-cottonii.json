    "intro": "Astragalus cottonii, commonly known as the cottonhead milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Astragalus cottonii is adapted to withstand drought and is an important component of its native ecosystem."
