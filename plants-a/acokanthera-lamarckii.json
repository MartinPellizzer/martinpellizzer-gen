    "intro": "Acokanthera lamarckii, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many plants with milky sap and toxic properties. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant produces a milky latex that is highly poisonous. Due to its toxic compounds, it has been traditionally used in the preparation of poison-tipped arrows by indigenous communities.",
