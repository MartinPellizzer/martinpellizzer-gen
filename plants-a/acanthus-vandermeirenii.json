    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus vandermeirenii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. This plant is found in the dry deciduous forest regions of the island. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives partial to full sunlight. Acanthus vandermeirenii is adapted to the unique climate and ecological conditions of Madagascar. It is a rare and endemic species, highlighting the biodiversity of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus vandermeirenii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking, architectural foliage and showy inflorescences. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and public spaces where its dramatic appearance adds visual interest. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. The plant is native to South Africa but has been introduced to other regions, including parts of Europe and the United States. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to different climatic conditions."
