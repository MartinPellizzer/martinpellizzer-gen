    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. verlotii, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in a fine layer of hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is often found in mountainous areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
