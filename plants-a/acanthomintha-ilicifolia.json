This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and valleys throughout its native range. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. The species is known for its aromatic foliage and small, tubular flowers. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthomintha ilicifolia was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California. It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in areas with moderate to full sunlight. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities."
