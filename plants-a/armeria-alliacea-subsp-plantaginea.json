    "intro": "Armeria alliacea subsp. plantaginea, commonly known as the woolly sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or shingle soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
