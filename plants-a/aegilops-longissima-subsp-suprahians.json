    "intro": "Aegilops longissima subsp. suprahians, commonly known as the long-awned wild wheat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and long, feathery glumes, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female reproductive structures. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential use in breeding programs."
