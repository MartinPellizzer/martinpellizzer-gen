    "intro": "Aristolochia setigera, commonly known as the slender Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding growth habit. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
