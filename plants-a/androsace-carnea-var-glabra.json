It features a dense mat of slender, hairy stems that produce small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The leaves are typically rounded and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude environments."
