    "intro": "Alyssum helianthemifolium, commonly known as the sunflower leaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of sunflowers, hence its common name. The plant has silvery-green, narrow, and slightly hairy leaves that are arranged in a compact, mat-like form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Alyssum helianthemifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
