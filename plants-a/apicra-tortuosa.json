    "intro": "Apicra tortuosa, commonly known as the twisted apicra, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed-like species. The plant is characterized by its slender, winding stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Apicra tortuosa is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
