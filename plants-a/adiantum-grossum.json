    "intro": "Adiantum grossum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and often have a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum grossum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings.",
