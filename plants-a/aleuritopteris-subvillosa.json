    "intro": "Aleuritopteris subvillosa, commonly known as the silky water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely toothed fronds that are covered in a soft, silky layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the substrate, forming dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is not commonly observed in Aleuritopteris subvillosa."
