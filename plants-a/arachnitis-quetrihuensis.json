    "intro": "Arachnitis quetrihuensis, commonly known as the Quetrihu\u00e9n spider plant, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rosette formation of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
