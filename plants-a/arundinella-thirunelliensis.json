    "intro": "Arundinella thirunelliensis, commonly known as the Thirunelli bamboo, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth surface and a slightly pointed tip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native region."
