    "intro": "Arabis lemmonii var. depauperata, commonly known as the Lemmon's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arid environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It is adapted to harsh conditions, with a compact growth form that helps it conserve moisture. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
