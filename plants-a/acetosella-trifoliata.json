    "intro": "Acetosella trifoliata, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a small perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped and often tinged with red or purple veins. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Acetosella trifoliata is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it forms dense mats. It is a member of the Oxalidaceae family and is known for its edible leaves, though they should be consumed in moderation due to their oxalic acid content.",
