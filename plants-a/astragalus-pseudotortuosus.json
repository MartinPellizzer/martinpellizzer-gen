It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Astragalus pseudotortuosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert organisms."
