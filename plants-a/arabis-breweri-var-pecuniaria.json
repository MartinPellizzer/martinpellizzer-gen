    "intro": "Arabis breweri var. pecuniaria, commonly known as the Desert Sand Verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and sandy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in dry climates."
