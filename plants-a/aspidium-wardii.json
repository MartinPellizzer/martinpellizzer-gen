    "intro": "Aspidium wardii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that form a compact, shield-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium wardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in horticulture for its lush, foliage."
