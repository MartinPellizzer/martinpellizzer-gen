    "intro": "Amorpha herbacea, commonly known as yellow indigo, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing seeds. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Amorpha herbacea is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
