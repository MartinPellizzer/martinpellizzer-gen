    "intro": "Abutilon hasslerianum f. johnsonii, commonly known as the Johnson's velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant native to Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring heart-shaped leaves with a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, often appearing in late spring to early summer.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon hasslerianum f. johnsonii is primarily native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and parts of Oklahoma. It is also found in northern Mexico, including the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. It is commonly associated with limestone habitats and is often seen in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon hasslerianum f. johnsonii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped leaves and showy flowers. The distribution is primarily limited to cultivated gardens and landscaped areas rather than natural habitats. It has not established itself in the wild and is not considered invasive in the region. Its presence is largely confined to human-modified environments."
