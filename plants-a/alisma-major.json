    "intro": "Alisma major, commonly known as greater waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and aquatic environments. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for water habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often emerging from the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and colonize new areas within its wetland habitat. Alisma major plays an important role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
