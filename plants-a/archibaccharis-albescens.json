    "intro": "Archibaccharis albescens, commonly known as the whiteleaf baccharis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, white seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Archibaccharis albescens plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
