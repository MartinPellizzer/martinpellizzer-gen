It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes. Arnica helvetica is often found in meadows and open slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a vital role in the local environment."
