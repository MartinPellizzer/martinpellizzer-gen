    "intro": "Agrostis cimicina, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its fine, wiry blades and compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. Agrostis cimicina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant restorations."
