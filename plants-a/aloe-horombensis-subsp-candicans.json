    "intro": "Aloe horombensis subsp. candicans, commonly known as the Zanzibar aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Zanzibar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which are pollinated by insects. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional medicine practices."
