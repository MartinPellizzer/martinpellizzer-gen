    "intro": "Anagallis barbata, commonly known as the mouse-ear or trailing jewelweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, delicate flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has hairy, oval-shaped leaves and often grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tiny seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Anagallis barbata is often cultivated as a ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and brief flowering period."
