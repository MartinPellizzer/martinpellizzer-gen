    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. acutilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed rock fern, is a terrestrial fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit. The fronds are typically lanceolate with acuminate tips, and the leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices. The plant's rhizomes are short and rhizomatous, contributing to its ability to colonize and persist in its habitat."
