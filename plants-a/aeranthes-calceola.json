It features a compact growth habit with a single, short stem and a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system and is often found growing in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. Aeranthes calceola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific care requirements."
