    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema trapezifolia is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is typically found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is also observed in parts of Paraguay and Argentina.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema trapezifolia was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and agricultural fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas. Its introduction has led to its spread in several regions outside its native range. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain environments."
