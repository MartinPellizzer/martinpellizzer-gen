    "intro": "Antidesma ambiguum, commonly known as the African starfruit or false starfruit, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible. Its fruit is often used in local cuisines and has a sweet, tangy flavor similar to that of true starfruit. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
