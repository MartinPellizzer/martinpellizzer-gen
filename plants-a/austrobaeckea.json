    "intro": "Austrobaeckea, commonly known as the silky oak, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to Australia and New Zealand, with several species found in temperate and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their compound leaves, often with a silvery or grayish underside, and small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Austrobaeckea species are generally shrubs or small trees, and they play an important ecological role in their native habitats. Some species are cultivated for ornamental purposes due to their attractive foliage and resilience to various environmental conditions."
