It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Austrodanthonia occidentalis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
