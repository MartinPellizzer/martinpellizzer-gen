It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late summer. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found along stream banks and pond edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often reddish in color. Aster hydrophilus plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining wetland ecosystems."
