    "intro": "Amellus strigosus subsp. strigosus, commonly known as the rough amelus, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in stiff, hairy pubescence, which gives it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in loose inflorescences, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local insect populations and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
