It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in sandy, salty environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for coastal gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
