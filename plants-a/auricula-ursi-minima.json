    "intro": "Auricula-ursi minima, commonly known as the dwarf bear's ear, is a small, alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
