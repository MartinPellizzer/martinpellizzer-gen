    "intro": "Athyrium elongatum, commonly known as the elongated lady fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides, preferring well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium elongatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
