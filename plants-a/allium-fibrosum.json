    "intro": "Allium fibrosum, commonly known as the fibrous garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its fibrous, white underground bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in a loose umbel. Allium fibrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible bulbs, though they are less commonly used than other Allium species. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings."
