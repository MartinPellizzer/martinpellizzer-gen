    "intro": "Arthraxon ciliaris var. cryptatherus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland margins. Due to its low profile and dense growth, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
