    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia macrantha is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia macrantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in some regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often invading native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types contribute to its invasive potential."
