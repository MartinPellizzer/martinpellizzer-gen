    "intro": "Agropyron scirpeum var. gracile, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and its flowering heads are small and spike-like. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its ability to colonize disturbed or wetland habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
