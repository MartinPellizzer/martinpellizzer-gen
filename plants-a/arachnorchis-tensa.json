    "intro": "Arachnorchis tensa, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from June to August. Arachnorchis tensa is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
