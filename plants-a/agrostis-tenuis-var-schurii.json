    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis var. schurii, commonly known as Schur's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like turf and is characterized by its fine, silky blades and tufted inflorescences. The plant prefers well-drained soils and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its small, spike-like flowers are usually pale green to brown, and it is known for its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Schur's bentgrass is also valued for its use in ornamental gardening and as a component in some turfgrass mixtures."
