    "intro": "Almeidea affinis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Almeidea affinis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
