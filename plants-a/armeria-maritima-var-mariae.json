    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. mariae, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune habitats. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize coastal soils."
