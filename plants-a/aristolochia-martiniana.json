    "intro": "Aristolochia martiniana, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
