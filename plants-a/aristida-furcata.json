    "intro": "Aristida furcata, commonly known as the forked grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that often branch at the base, giving it its common name. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, deserts, and along roadsides. Aristida furcata is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
