    "intro": "Athyrium dajinense, commonly known as the Dajin fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant features delicate, pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Athyrium dajinense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
