    "intro": "Agrestis setacea, commonly known as the hairy grass or setaceous grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and distinctive, hairy leaves that are often arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in disturbed soils and marginal habitats. Agrestis setacea is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, contributing to ecological diversity in these environments."
