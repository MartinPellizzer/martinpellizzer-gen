The leaves are typically succulent, fleshy, and covered in a layer of fine, salt-excreting crystals known as bladders. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important plant for stabilizing coastal and desert environments. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh conditions, showcasing resilience to drought and high salinity."
