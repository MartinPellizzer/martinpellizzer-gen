    "intro": "Arabis gerardi subsp. longisiliqua, commonly known as the long-stalked rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
