    "intro": "Arabis halleri var. tatrica, commonly known as the Tatric Alps rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats at high altitudes, where it forms low, compact rosettes of dark green leaves. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to mountainous landscapes. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to other members of the species."
