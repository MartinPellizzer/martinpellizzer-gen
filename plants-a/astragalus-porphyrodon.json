    "intro": "Astragalus porphyrodon, commonly known as the purple-stemmed milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of China and Mongolia. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, hairy stems, and small, yellow flowers clustered in racemes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Astragalus porphyrodon is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
