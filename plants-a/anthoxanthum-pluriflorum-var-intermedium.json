    "intro": "Anthoxanthum pluriflorum var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear inflorescences of spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green sheen, and the flowers are small and yellowish-green, arranged in dense clusters. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
