This subspecies is found in the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open habitats. The plant is adapted to the climate and soil conditions of these regions. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon puberulum subsp. puberulum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure, often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. This subspecies is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It is also used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soils in degraded landscapes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
