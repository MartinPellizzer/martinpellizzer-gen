    "intro": "Arthraxon ciliaris var. tenellus, commonly known as the slender spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in sandy or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its low-growing nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a groundcover in restoration projects."
