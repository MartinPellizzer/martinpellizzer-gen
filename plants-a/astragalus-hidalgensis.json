    "intro": "Astragalus hidalgensis, commonly known as the Hidalgo milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
