    "intro": "Arabis accedens, commonly known as the coastal rockcress, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its small, white or pink flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Arabis accedens is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
