    "intro": "Aronia melanocarpa var. subpubescens, commonly known as the purple chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are rich in antioxidants and anthocyanins. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are usually hairy on the underside, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential health benefits from its berries."
