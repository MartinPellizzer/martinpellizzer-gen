    "intro": "Anthericum liliago subsp. macrocarpum, commonly known as the broad-fruited lily of the wall, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a distinctive, inflated, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. This subspecies is often found in rocky or calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
