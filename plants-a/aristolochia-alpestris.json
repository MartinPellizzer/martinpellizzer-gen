The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are usually brownish or purple in color, with a complex structure that resembles a pipe. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing at high elevations. The plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
