It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Albertisia cuneata is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome in the Western Cape region of South Africa."
