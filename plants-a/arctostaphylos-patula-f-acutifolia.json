    "intro": "Arctostaphylos patula f. acutifolia, commonly known as the sharpleaf manzanita, is a compact shrub native to California and southern Oregon. It features dense, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that have a pointed tip, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by edible berries that are favored by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to coastal gardens. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it an excellent choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
