    "intro": "Aster marginatus var. argenteus, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
