    "intro": "Agrostis gayana, commonly known as the African silver grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its slender, tufted inflorescence consists of small spikelets that are often tinged with red or purple hues. Agrostis gayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
