    "intro": "Aristida vulgaris var. pumila, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, silver-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance, often resembling a carpet of fine, soft foliage. The plant produces small, fluffy panicles of pale green to brownish flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
