    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. muticum, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass variant, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread extensively across open ground. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils, lawns, and along roadsides due to its adaptability and rapid colonization ability. Its botanical features make it a hardy, resilient plant that thrives in a variety of environmental conditions."
