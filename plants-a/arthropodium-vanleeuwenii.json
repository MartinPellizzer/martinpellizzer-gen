    "intro": "Arthropodium vanleeuwenii, commonly known as the silver grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flower spikes in spring, which are borne on slender stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a valuable groundcover in native gardens. Arthropodium vanleeuwenii is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas."
