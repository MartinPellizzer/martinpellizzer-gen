It is characterized by its large, showy flowers with white petals and a distinctive purple throat, which are typically fragrant. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, making it a unique feature of the local flora. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
