    "intro": "Agropyron vaillantianum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is well-suited to harsh environments due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Agropyron vaillantianum is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
