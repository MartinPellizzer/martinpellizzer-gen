    "intro": "Aconitum cannabifolium, commonly known as the cannabis-leaved monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble cannabis leaves, hence its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
