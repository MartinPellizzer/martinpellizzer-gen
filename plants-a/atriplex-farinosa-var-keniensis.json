    "intro": "Atriplex farinosa var. keniensis, commonly known as Kenyan saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its succulent leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of salt, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. This species is also valued for its potential in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
