    "intro": "Aristolochia dalyi, commonly known as the Daly's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is known for its complex inflorescence structure. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, such as flies and beetles. The genus Aristolochia is notable for containing aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
