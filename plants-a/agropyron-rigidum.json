    "intro": "Agropyron rigidum, commonly known as rigid wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, tufted growth and bluish-green foliage, which remains dense even in harsh winter conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in compact clusters, with awns (bristle-like structures) that aid in seed dispersal. Its rhizomes are extensive, allowing it to form dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agropyron rigidum is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ecological benefits."
