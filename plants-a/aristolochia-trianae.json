It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is needed due to its toxic properties."
