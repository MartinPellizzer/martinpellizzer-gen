    "intro": "Angolluma kochii, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in spikes, which bloom in spring. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Angolluma kochii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
