    "intro": "Andropogon courtallumensis, commonly known as the Malabar grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of Asia, particularly India and Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted growth pattern. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
