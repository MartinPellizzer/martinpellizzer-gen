    "intro": "Acacia semicordata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, sickle-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. Acacia semicordata is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suited to dry climates. It is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia semicordata is primarily native to India. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal areas and thorny shrublands. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native habitat. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is sometimes used for its timber and fuelwood.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia semicordata was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen. It has also been introduced as an ornamental plant in some parts of the world for its attractive foliage and flowers. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
