    "intro": "Acrostichum appendiculatum var. ludens, commonly known as the golden fern, is a tropical fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow fronds that contrast sharply with its dark green stems. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation.",
