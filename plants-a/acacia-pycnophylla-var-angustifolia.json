    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pycnophylla var. angustifolia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry forest, woodland, and heathland environments. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is well adapted to the seasonal rainfall patterns of its native region. The plant is an important component of the local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pycnophylla var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been established in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, growing in coastal and mountainous areas. This variety is known for its narrow leaves and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural vegetation, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction is primarily attributed to human activities such as gardening and land clearing."
