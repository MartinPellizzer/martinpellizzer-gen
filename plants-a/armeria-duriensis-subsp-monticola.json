    "intro": "Armeria duriensis subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain armelia, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, compact habit and dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
