    "intro": "Androrchis mascula subsp. longicalcarata, commonly known as the long-fruited marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single, lanceolate leaf, and produces a raceme of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
