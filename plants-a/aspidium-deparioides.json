    "intro": "Aspidium deparioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, lobed fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive, undulating margin. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or vegetation. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typically near the base. Aspidium deparioides plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
