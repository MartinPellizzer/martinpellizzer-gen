    "intro": "Aralia rex, commonly known as the royal aralia, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palm-like leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, giving it a dramatic and lush appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a showy purple bract, which adds to its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its size and beauty, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
