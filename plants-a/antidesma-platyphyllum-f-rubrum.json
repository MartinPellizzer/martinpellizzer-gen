    "intro": "Antidesma platyphyllum f. rubrum, commonly known as the red-fruited antidesma, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are a striking feature of the species. These berries are typically eaten by birds and contribute to the plant's dispersal. The plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
