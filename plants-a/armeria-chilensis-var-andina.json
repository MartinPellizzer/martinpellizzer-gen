It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of silver-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
