    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon periplocifolium var. albicans is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically along the Atlantic coast. It is found in states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils near coastal areas and in disturbed habitats. It is commonly associated with dunes, marshes, and other coastal environments. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon periplocifolium var. albicans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
