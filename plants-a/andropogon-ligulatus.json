    "intro": "Andropogon ligulatus, commonly known as flatleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and moist soils, forming dense clumps with narrow, flat leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Flatleaf bluestem is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
