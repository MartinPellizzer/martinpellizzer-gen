    "intro": "Aspidium stimulans, commonly known as the spurred brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with small, spore-bearing sporangia clustered on the underside of the leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. Aspidium stimulans is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
