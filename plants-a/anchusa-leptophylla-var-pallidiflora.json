    "intro": "Anchusa leptophylla var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the paleflower thornweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
