    "intro": "Aspalathus tridentata subsp. rotunda, commonly known as the rooibos bush, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its most notable feature is the unique shape of its leaves, which are rounded and slightly heart-shaped. This subspecies is closely related to the commercially important Aspalathus linearis, from which rooibos tea is derived."
