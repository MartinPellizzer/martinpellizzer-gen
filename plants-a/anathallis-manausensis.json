    "intro": "Anathallis manausensis, commonly known as the Manaus torchflower, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence bearing numerous small, torch-like flowers. The plant typically grows on tree branches, drawing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are predominantly white with a faint pinkish hue, and they emit a subtle fragrance to attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis manausensis is considered a vulnerable species."
