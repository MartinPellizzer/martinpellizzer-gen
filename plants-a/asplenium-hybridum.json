    "intro": "Asplenium hybridum, commonly known as the hybrid spleenwort, is a fern species belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly glossy surface. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium hybridum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological studies."
