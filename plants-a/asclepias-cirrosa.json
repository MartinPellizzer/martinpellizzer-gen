    "intro": "Asclepias cirrosa, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for caterpillars. Asclepias cirrosa is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
