    "intro": "Anthurium koesteri, commonly known as the Velvet Leaf, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, velvety dark green leaves that are often adorned with a striking red or purple vein. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium koesteri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
