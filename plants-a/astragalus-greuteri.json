    "intro": "Astragalus greuteri, commonly known as the Sierra milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in mountainous regions, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus greuteri plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
