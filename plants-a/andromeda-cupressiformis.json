    "intro": "Andromeda cupressiformis, commonly known as the sweetbay magnolia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and fragrant, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is reddish-brown and peels in thin, papery layers, adding to its ornamental appeal. Andromeda cupressiformis is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils."
