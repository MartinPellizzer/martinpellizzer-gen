    "intro": "Acmostima longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved acmostima, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range.",
