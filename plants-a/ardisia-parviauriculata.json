    "intro": "Ardisia parviauriculata, commonly known as the small-leaf beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are a significant food source for various bird species."
