It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and full sun. Armeria cantabrica var. alpina is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
