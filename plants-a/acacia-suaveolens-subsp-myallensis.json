    "intro": "Acacia suaveolens subsp. myallensis, commonly known as the Myall acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched form and phyllodes that are typically straight or slightly curved. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, followed by flat, leathery pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand dry conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens subsp. myallensis is primarily native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is found in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas, specifically within the Geraldton Sandplains and the coastal dunes of the Pilbara region. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and inland sandplain habitats. It is often seen growing in open woodlands and heathlands, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is limited to this specific geographic area, making it a regionally significant plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens subsp. myallensis was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal areas and inland dunes. This subspecies is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil. It has also been introduced to parts of New South Wales and Queensland for similar ecological purposes. However, its spread is limited to specific environmental conditions that support its growth."
