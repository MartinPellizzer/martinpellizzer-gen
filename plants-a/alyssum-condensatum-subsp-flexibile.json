    "intro": "Alyssum condensatum subsp. flexibile, commonly known as flexible alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, providing some protection against cold and wind. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in rocky or marginal habitats."
