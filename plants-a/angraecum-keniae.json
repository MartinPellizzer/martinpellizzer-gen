It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale lavender flowers. The plant produces nectar-rich blossoms that are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as the giant hawkmoth. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Angraecum keniae is known for its slow growth and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
