    "intro": "Amoora tomentosa, commonly known as the silky ash or velvet ash, is a small to medium-sized tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Amoora tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its growth habit and foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
