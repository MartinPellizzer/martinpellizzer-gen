    "intro": "Artanthe curvata, commonly known as the curling artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking, fern-like leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice among gardeners in arid regions."
