    "intro": "Alyssum macropodum var. heterotrichum, commonly known as the variable alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with dense, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
