    "intro": "Arctagrostis latifolia var. aristulata, commonly known as the broadleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Its ornamental value comes from its fine texture and seasonal color changes, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
