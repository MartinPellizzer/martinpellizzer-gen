    "intro": "Athyrium copelandii, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a deciduous fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a striking contrast between light and dark green hues. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers partial to full shade. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. The fronds are divided into narrow, arching segments that create a feathery appearance."
