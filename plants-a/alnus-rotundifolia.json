    "intro": "Alnus rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to northern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, round-lobed leaves and small, yellowish flowers that appear in catkins. The plant is often found growing in moist, well-drained soils, particularly in forested areas or along stream banks. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common pioneer species in ecological succession."
