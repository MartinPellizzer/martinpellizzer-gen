    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus var. vinealis, commonly known as the creeping mouse-ear grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brown flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
