It features small, showy flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a white or pink center. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit, making it ideal for rock gardens or as a ground cover. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
