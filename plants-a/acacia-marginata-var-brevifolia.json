    "intro": "Acacia marginata var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves and produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to dry and arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its acacia pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia marginata var. brevifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with spinifex plains and other dryland ecosystems. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its distribution is largely confined to the inland and coastal areas of northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia marginata var. brevifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces, particularly in fynbos vegetation types. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native flora. Its introduction has led to both ecological and horticultural significance in the region."
