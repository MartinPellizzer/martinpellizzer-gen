    "intro": "Arundo neglecta, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that can grow up to 6 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense spikes during the summer months. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a valuable habitat for wildlife and a potential invasive species in non-native regions."
