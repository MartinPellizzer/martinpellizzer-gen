    "intro": "Antennaria rosea subsp. rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features hairy, linear leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. This subspecies is an important component of coastal dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
