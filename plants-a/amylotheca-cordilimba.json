    "intro": "Amylotheca cordilimba, commonly known as the slender-stemmed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It has a distinctive thallus structure with a leathery, greenish to yellowish upper surface and a lighter, more granular lower surface. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capability. It is typically found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its slow growth and specific habitat requirements make it a valuable indicator of environmental health."
