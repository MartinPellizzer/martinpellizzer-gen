    "intro": "Angraecum fournierae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences bearing white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive red lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. It is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can go dormant during dry periods. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
