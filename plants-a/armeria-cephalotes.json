    "intro": "Armeria cephalotes, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy clusters of white or pink flowers at the tips of its stems, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Armeria cephalotes is well-suited to coastal dune ecosystems and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
