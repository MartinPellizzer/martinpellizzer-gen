    "intro": "Arenaria cambodianum, commonly known as the Cambodian sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Cambodia. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun conditions. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
