    "intro": "Anemone coelestina var. holophylla, commonly known as the sky anemone, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its unique coloration and delicate appearance make it a valuable addition to botanical collections and gardens."
