    "intro": "Aerangis verdickii, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives on the forest floor. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered endangered in its natural range."
