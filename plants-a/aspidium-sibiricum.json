    "intro": "Aspidium sibiricum, commonly known as the Siberian water fern, is a species of fern native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and mountainous areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium sibiricum is notable for its ability to survive in harsh climates due to its low maintenance and adaptability."
