    "intro": "Andrachne microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs. Andrachne microphylla is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and succulent stems that store water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
