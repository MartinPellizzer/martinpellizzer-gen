    "intro": "Aristida longespica var. geniculata, commonly known as the bentstem dropseed, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and fine, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. It is a low-maintenance ornamental grass that is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive fall color."
