    "intro": "Astragalus eucosmus var. terrae-novae, commonly known as the Terra Nova milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is a perennial herb with slender, upright stems that bear small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense spikes. The plant has palmate leaves composed of several leaflets, and its root system is fibrous and adapted to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
