    "intro": "Arracacia ovata, commonly known as the Brazilian nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of hard-shelled fruits containing edible seeds known as Brazil nuts. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 50 meters tall, making it a significant component of the rainforest canopy. Its flowers are small and yellowish, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The tree plays an important ecological role in supporting biodiversity and maintaining soil stability in its habitat."
