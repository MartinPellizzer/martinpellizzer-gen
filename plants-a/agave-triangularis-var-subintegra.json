    "intro": "Agave triangularis var. subintegra, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a species native to the Mexican state of San Luis Potos\u00ed. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces striking, white to pale yellow flowers in terminal clusters, which appear after several years of growth. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant's rosette structure and architectural form make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens and rockeries."
