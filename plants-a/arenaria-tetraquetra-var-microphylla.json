    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. Its compact form and ability to colonize rocky or barren areas make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
