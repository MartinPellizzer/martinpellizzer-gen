    "intro": "Argusia argentea, commonly known as silver argus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with finely divided leaflets that give it a delicate appearance. The fruit is a dry, three-lobed schizocarp, which splits into three parts when mature."
