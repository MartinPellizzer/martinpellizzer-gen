    "intro": "Acirostrum, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Acirostrum species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and they are often mistaken for true hellebores due to their similar appearance. These plants are generally non-native to North America but have been introduced in some regions."
