    "intro": "Aristolochia daemoninoxia, commonly known as the Devil's Trumpet, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a trumpet. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a bright red, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in humid, shaded environments. Due to its toxicity, it is important to handle the plant with care."
