    "intro": "Anguria keithii, commonly known as the Keith's bitter melon, is a species of flowering plant in the Cucurbitaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is characterized by its elongated, ribbed fruits that are typically green when unripe and turn yellow or orange when mature. The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has a trailing growth habit with hairy stems. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the fruit contains numerous seeds enclosed in a fibrous pulp. Anguria keithii is often cultivated for its edible fruit, though it is known for its bitter taste."
