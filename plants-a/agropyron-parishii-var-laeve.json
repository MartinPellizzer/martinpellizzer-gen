    "intro": "Agropyron parishii var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous pale-green to brown florets. It is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. Agropyron parishii var. laeve is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
