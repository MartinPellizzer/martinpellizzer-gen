    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. oligacantha, commonly known as the coastal acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems and small, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize dunes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. oligacantha is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. This plant is commonly found in temperate to subtropical climates, growing in open grasslands, shrublands, and along coastal areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed or marginal habitats. The species is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Its native range includes parts of southern South America where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. oligacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and can spread rapidly through its seed dispersal mechanism. Its establishment has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
