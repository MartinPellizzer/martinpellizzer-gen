    "intro": "Aulacocalyx jasminiflora subsp. kivuensis, commonly known as the Kivu wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling jasmine, hence its species name. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded conditions and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
