    "intro": "Antholyza namaquensis, commonly known as the Namaqua starling, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in rocky and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Antholyza namaquensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
