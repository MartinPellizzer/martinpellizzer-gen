    "intro": "Aristolochia biakensis, commonly known as the Biak arrow vine, is a climbing shrub native to the Indonesian island of Biak. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its striking, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family, known for its complex floral structures and often toxic compounds. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
