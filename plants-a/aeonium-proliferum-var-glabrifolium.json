It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a smooth, almost hairless surface. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers on tall, branched stems during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
