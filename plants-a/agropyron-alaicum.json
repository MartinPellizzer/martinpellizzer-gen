    "intro": "Agropyron alaicum, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in harsh, alpine environments, demonstrating remarkable tolerance to cold and drought. Agropyron alaicum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
