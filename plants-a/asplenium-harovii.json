    "intro": "Asplenium harovii, commonly known as the Harov's spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is a small, epiphytic fern. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Madagascar. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its fronds are typically clustered and grow in a rosette formation, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium harovii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found on tree trunks or rocks in its natural habitat."
