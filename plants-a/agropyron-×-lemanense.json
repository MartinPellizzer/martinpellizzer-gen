    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 lemanense, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species that originates from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum. It is a perennial plant characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters, and it is well adapted to a variety of soil types. Agropyron \u00d7 lemanense is often cultivated for forage and has potential as a forage crop due to its high nutritional value and drought tolerance. Additionally, it is of interest in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
