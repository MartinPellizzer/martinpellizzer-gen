    "intro": "Alyssum montanum f. macrophyllum, commonly known as the large-leaved alpine sandwort, is a botanical variant of the alpine alyssum. It is characterized by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form, which are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
