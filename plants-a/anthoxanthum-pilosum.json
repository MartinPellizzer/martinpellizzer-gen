    "intro": "Anthoxanthum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, pale yellow to golden florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Anthoxanthum pilosum is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
