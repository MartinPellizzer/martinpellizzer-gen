    "intro": "Arctium hohenackeri, commonly known as the Hohenacker hogweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a biennial or perennial herb characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
