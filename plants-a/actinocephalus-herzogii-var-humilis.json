    "intro": "Actinocephalus herzogii var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf actinocephalus, is a small, succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features compact, rounded stems covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted for storing water, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance.",
