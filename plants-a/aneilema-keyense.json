    "intro": "Aneilema keyense, commonly known as the Key Island arrowroot, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant features a rhizomatous stem system and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. Its flowers are clustered in a spathe, typical of the Araceae family, and are often surrounded by a showy, modified leaf called a spathe. Aneilema keyense is adapted to wetland environments and is often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks."
