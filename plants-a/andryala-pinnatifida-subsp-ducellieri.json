    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida subsp. ducellieri, commonly known as the dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive prolonged dry periods. This subspecies is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor conditions."
