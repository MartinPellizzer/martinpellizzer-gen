    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium, commonly known as hemlock water-dropwort, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescences and hollow stems. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white to greenish flowers that appear in umbrella-shaped clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides. However, it is considered invasive in some regions and can pose a threat to native plant communities."
