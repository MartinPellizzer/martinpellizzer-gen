    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia fragrantissima is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This species is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Acacia fragrantissima is also known for its fragrant flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia fragrantissima was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, temperate climate and well-drained soils, particularly in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils where it thrives in full sun. This plant is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive, fragrant flowers. It has also been introduced to some parts of the United States, including California and Texas, where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes. However, it can become invasive in certain areas if not managed properly."
