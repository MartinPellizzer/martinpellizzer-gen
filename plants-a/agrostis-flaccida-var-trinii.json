It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, spreading clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
