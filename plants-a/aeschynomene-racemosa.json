    "intro": "Aeschynomene racemosa, commonly known as partridge pea, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and racemose inflorescence. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It produces small, yellow flowers that give way to legume-like pods containing edible seeds. Aeschynomene racemosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in both traditional medicine and as a forage crop."
