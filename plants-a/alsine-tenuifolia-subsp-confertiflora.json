It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
