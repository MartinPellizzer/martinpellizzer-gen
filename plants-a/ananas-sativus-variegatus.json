    "intro": "Ananas sativus variegatus, commonly known as the variegated pineapple plant, is a cultivar of the pineapple species characterized by its striking, colorful leaf patterns. This plant is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white, yellow, or pink markings. While it does not produce edible fruit like the common pineapple, it is prized as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant leaf colors."
