    "intro": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. goodmaniana, commonly known as the Goodman's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many species of mustard and cress plants. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, basal leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This variant of the species is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the coastal and inland areas. It thrives in rocky soils and dry habitats, often growing in chaparral and coastal scrub environments. The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of California, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its native distribution is limited to certain parts of California, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. goodmaniana was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in forested regions. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in the understory of native forests. This plant is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
