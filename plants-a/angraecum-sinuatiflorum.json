    "intro": "Angraecum sinuatiflorum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender petals and a distinctive star-shaped lip, which are adapted for specific pollination by the hawkmoth. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, making it a unique feature of the local ecosystem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered vulnerable to habitat loss and climate change."
