    "intro": "Atriplex halimus, commonly known as the Mediterranean saltbush, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. It is often found in coastal areas and saline soils due to its tolerance for salt and drought. Atriplex halimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
