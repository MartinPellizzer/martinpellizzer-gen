It is a medium-sized palm tree that produces large, elongated fruits containing a highly valued oil-rich seed kernel. The botanical features include a tall, slender trunk with smooth, gray bark and pinnate leaves composed of numerous lance-shaped leaflets. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns from green to yellow or orange, indicating maturity. The plant is well adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its natural habitat."
