    "intro": "Allium ochroleucum subsp. pseudosuaveolens, commonly known as the narrowleaf garlic, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a flowering stem with umbels of white or pale purple flowers. The plant has a strong garlic odor due to its sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. This subspecies is closely related to other Allium species and is valued for its ornamental and culinary potential."
