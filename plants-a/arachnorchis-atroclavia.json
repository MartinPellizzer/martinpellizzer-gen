    "intro": "Arachnorchis atroclavia, commonly known as the black-clawed spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender pseudobulbs and dark, claw-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of purple and pink, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
