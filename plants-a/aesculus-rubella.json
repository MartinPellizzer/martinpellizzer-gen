    "intro": "Aesculus rubella, commonly known as the red horse chestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its showy, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain smooth, chestnut-like seeds. Aesculus rubella is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities. It is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
