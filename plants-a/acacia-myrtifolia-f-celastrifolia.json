    "intro": "Acacia myrtifolia f. celastrifolia, commonly known as the golden wattle variant, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It features slender, often multi-branched stems with a rough, bark-like texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and arranged in pairs along the stems. This form is distinguished by its unique floral structure, resembling that of the genus Celastrus, hence its specific epithet.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia myrtifolia f. celastrifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This subspecies is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, thriving in environments with low rainfall. It is often associated with shrublands and savannas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. The plant is well adapted to withstand drought conditions and high temperatures. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones that match its environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia myrtifolia f. celastrifolia was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and mild, wet winters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and rocky outcrops. This introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range, including parts of southern Europe and California. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns among land managers and conservationists."
