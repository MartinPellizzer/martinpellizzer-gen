    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. nanella, commonly known as the small-flowered burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruits are spherical, hairy burrs that disperse seeds via wind and animals. It thrives in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens.",

This subspecies thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is commonly associated with areas that have a temperate climate and well-drained soils. The plant is part of the dandelion family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. nanella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various parts of the country. This subspecies is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, wastelands, and forest margins. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its presence has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native plant communities."
