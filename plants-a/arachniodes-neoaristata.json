    "intro": "Arachniodes neoaristata, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of China and Japan. It features delicate, lacy fronds with a distinctive silver-white coloration on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually and form dense clumps. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with finely divided segments that create a feathery appearance. It thrives in shady, humid conditions and is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant, airy foliage."
