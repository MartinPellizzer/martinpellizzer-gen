    "intro": "Artemisia tilesii subsp. hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
