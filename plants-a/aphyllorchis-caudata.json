It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spike that can reach up to 3 feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
