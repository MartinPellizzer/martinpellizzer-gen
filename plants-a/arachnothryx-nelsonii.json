    "intro": "Arachnothryx nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's arachnothryx, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of northern South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by animals. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
