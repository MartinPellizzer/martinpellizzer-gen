    "intro": "Aira cespitosa subsp. rhenana, commonly known as slender false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features tufted growth with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and it is often found in habitats with moderate to high humidity. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
