It belongs to the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The trunk is covered in a rough, fibrous layer that gives it a distinctive appearance. Its fronds are typically bright green with a waxy texture and can grow quite long, adding to its ornamental value. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
