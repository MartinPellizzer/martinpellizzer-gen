    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian maple, is a naturally occurring variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant typically grows in the wild in southern Europe, particularly in Sicily, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",
