    "intro": "Acrostichum excelsum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a large, tropical fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are bi-directionally divided, creating a unique, feathery appearance. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and habitat for various organisms.",
