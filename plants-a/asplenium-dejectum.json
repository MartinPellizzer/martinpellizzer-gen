It is characterized by its delicate, often pendulous fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rosette-like arrangement of leaves, with the lower leaves being more elongated and the upper ones shorter and more curled. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or in soil. Asplenium dejectum is known for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is commonly found in temperate regions."
