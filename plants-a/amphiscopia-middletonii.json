    "intro": "Amphiscopia middletonii, commonly known as the Middletons' bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap tiny organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its stems may extend into the air, facilitating gas exchange. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
