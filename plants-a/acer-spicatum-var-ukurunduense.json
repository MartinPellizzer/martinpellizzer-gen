    "intro": "Acer spicatum var. ukurunduense, commonly known as the Ukurundu maple, is a rare variant of the red maple native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more intense in the autumn, and its small, clustered flowers that appear in the spring. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with finely serrated edges and a glossy surface. This variant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturalists alike.",
