    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus f. glacialis, commonly known as the Alpine milkvetch, is a frost-tolerant perennial legume native to high-altitude regions of the Alps and Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are adapted to cold, arid environments. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain slopes. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils. The frosty form, 'glacialis,' reflects its adaptation to harsh, glacial climates."
