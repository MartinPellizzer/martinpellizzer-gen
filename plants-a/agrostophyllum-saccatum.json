    "intro": "Agrostophyllum saccatum, commonly known as the woolly grass or woolly saccate grass, is a species of flowering plant in the family Poaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, saccate (sac-like) leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses. Agrostophyllum saccatum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
