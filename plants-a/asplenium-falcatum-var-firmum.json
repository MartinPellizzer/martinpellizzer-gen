    "intro": "Asplenium falcatum var. firmum, commonly known as the firm moss fern, is a terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the fronds, which are typically found near the base of the plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. This variety is notable for its compact growth and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
