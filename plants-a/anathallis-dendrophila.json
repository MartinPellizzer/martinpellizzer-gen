    "intro": "Anathallis dendrophila, commonly known as the tree anathallis, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in loose racemes. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Anathallis dendrophila is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
