    "intro": "Acacia proxima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often visited by native bees and birds. Acacia proxima is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought-resistant features such as deep roots and reduced leaf surface area. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as coastal dunes and sandplains. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native range. Acacia proxima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia proxima was mainly introduced to specific regions in the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry climates. It is commonly found in gardens and urban landscapes where it serves as a hardy, drought-resistant plant. The introduction of Acacia proxima has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for landscaping in arid environments. However, its spread outside cultivated areas requires monitoring to prevent ecological disruption."
