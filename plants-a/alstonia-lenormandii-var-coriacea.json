    "intro": "Alstonia lenormandii var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough-barked alstonia, is a rare and distinctive plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark that gives it its common name, and its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
