    "intro": "Aizoon sarmentosum, commonly known as creeping aizoon, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branched stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Aizoon sarmentosum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
