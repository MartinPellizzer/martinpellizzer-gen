    "intro": "Ageratella microphylla var. palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's tickseed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
