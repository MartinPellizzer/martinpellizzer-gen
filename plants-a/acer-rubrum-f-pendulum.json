    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. pendulum, commonly known as the weeping red maple, is a unique cultivar of the red maple tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive, flowing appearance. This form exhibits the same vibrant autumn foliage as the typical red maple, displaying shades of orange, red, and yellow. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed, and turn brilliant colors in the fall, making it a popular ornamental tree. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking visual appeal, it is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and seasonal color changes.",
