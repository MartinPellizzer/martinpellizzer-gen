    "intro": "Asclepias tuberosa f. decumbens, commonly known as the decumbent milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and features showy, orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its foliage is typically hairy and has a milky sap that is characteristic of the Asclepias genus."
