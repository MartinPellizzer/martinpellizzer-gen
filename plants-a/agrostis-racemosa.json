It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence is a spike-like structure composed of small, two-rowed spikelets. Agrostis racemosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
