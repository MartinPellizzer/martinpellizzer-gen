    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris f. aestivalis, commonly known as the early alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of glossy, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is notable for its ability to retain moisture, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
