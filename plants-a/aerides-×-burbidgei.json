    "intro": "Aerides \u00d7 burbidgei, commonly known as the Burbridge's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Aerides odorata and Aerides cristata. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical regions of Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant is characterized by its elegant, pendulous flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The leaves are broad and glossy, providing a striking contrast to the delicate floral display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
