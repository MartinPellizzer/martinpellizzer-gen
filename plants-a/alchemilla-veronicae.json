It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features bright green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow environments. Alchemilla veronicae is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
