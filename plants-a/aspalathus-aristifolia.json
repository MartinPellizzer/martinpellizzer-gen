    "intro": "Aspalathus aristifolia, commonly known as the sweet bush or African rooibos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and small yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and warm, dry summers. It is closely related to the rooibos plant, which is renowned for its caffeine-free tea. Aspalathus aristifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native habitats."
