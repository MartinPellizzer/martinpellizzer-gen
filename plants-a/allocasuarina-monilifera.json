    "intro": "Allocasuarina monilifera, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or coastal soils. This species is well-suited to coastal and inland dry areas, making it an important component of native vegetation in these regions."
