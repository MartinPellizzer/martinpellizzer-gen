    "intro": "Aeonium glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky aeonium, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a sticky, waxy substance. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil. Aeonium glutinosum is popular in rock gardens and as a container plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
