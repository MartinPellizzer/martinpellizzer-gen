    "intro": "Atriplex campanulata, commonly known as the bellflower saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and its ability to thrive in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. Its leaves are usually small, succulent, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Atriplex campanulata plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
