It is characterized by its massive, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking, large, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically blue or purple and attract various pollinators. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research."
