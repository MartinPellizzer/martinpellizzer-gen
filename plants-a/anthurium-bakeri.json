    "intro": "Anthurium bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its small, spadix-like inflorescence. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium bakeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
