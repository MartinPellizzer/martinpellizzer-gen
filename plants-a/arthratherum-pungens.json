    "intro": "Arthratherum pungens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, pointed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
