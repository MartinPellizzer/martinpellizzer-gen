    "intro": "Astragalus onobrychis var. ernesti-mayeri, commonly known as the Turkish milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
