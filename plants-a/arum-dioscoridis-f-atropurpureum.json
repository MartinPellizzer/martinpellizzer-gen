    "intro": "Arum dioscoridis f. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaf arum, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a reddish-purple underside, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, purple spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage and unique flowering structure. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
