It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble pipes, often with a deep purple or greenish hue. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions.
