    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. galicicae, commonly known as the Galician alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
