    "intro": "Asclepias fournieri, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, orange-tipped clusters of flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, green, egg-shaped seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are opposite, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Asclepias fournieri is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
