    "intro": "Argyranthemum frutescens subsp. gracilescens, commonly known as the slender argyranthemum, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features small, daisy-like flowers with white to pale pink petals and a yellow central disc, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
