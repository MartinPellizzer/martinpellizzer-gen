    "intro": "Acinodendron foliosum, commonly known as the leafy acinodendron, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and small trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are often eaten by birds and small mammals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species.",
