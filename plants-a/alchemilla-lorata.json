    "intro": "Alchemilla lorata, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Alchemilla lorata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
