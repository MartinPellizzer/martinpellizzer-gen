    "intro": "Andromeda daboecia, commonly known as the Atlantic heath, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of Europe, particularly in regions like Portugal and Spain. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas, characterized by its evergreen leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, sandy soils and is often found in heathland and cliff habitats. Andromeda daboecia is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pink or white, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
