    "intro": "Asplenium squamuliferum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered with small, scale-like structures called squamulose. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The plant's unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
