    "intro": "Astragalus hypoglottis var. gremlii, commonly known as the Gremli's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deep within the soil. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
