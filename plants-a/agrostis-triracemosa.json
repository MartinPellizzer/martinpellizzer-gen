    "intro": "Agrostis triracemosa, commonly known as the three-branched bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Agrostis triracemosa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting various insect and bird species."
