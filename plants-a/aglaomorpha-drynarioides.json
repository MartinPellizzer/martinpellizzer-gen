It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant produces small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
