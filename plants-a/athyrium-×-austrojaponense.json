    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 austrojaponense, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits a combination of traits from its parent species, Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium niponicum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are grouped in clusters. This fern is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add a lush, tropical feel to gardens."
