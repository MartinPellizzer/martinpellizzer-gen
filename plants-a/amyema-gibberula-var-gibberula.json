It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate saline conditions, making it resilient in coastal environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its growth habit and ecological significance make it an important component of coastal vegetation."
