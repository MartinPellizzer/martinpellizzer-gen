    "intro": "Asclepias pulchra f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered milkweed, is a variant of the showy milkweed native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the green foliage and hairy stems. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like monarch butterflies."
