    "intro": "Astragalus gaviotus, commonly known as the Spanish milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus gaviotus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and scrublands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
