It is characterized by its distinctive, softly hairy leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions.",
