    "intro": "Angraecum setipes, commonly known as the star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence that bears numerous white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive central spur. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, airy substrates for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Angraecum setipes is considered a conservation concern."
