    "intro": "Anemone sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern China. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a short, fibrous root system and produces showy, white or pinkish flowers with five to seven petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture. Anemone sachalinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators."
