    "intro": "Anemone pratensis var. chlorantha, commonly known as the green anemone, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herbaceous plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while the stems are sturdy and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its unique greenish hue in the flower center, which sets it apart from other anemone species."
