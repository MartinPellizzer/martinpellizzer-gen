    "intro": "Agropyron caninum, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silky-haired leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Silky wheatgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control."
