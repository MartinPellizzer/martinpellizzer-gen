    "intro": "Arabis dispar, commonly known as the common rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully develop. Arabis dispar is a hardy perennial that is often used in rock gardens due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
