It is a perennial herb characterized by its yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This variety is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties, similar to other Astragalus species."
