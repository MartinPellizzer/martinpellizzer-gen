It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to brown flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spiky, bur-like fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium personata thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows and along roadsides."
