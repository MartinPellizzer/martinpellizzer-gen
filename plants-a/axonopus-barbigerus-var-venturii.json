    "intro": "Axonopus barbigerus var. venturii, commonly known as the hairy axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture on both sides. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its adaptability to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
