    "intro": "Asplenium wuliangshanense, commonly known as the Wuliangshan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest understories. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a serrated margin, and it produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
