    "intro": "Aristolochia rugosa, commonly known as the rough-petaled Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that are often maroon or purple in color. The plant has heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
