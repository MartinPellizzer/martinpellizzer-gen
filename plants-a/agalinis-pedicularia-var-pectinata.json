    "intro": "Agalinis pedicularia var. pectinata, commonly known as the sticky fleabane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. It is known for its sticky secretions on the petals, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
