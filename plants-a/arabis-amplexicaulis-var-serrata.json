    "intro": "Arabis amplexicaulis var. serrata, commonly known as the serrated rock\u767d\u83dc, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
