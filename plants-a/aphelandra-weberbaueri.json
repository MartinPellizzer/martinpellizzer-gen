    "intro": "Aphelandra weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra weberbaueri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant, long-lasting foliage and unique appearance."
