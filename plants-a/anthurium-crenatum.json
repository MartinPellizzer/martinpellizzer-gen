    "intro": "Anthurium crenatum, commonly known as the zigzag anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces striking, brightly colored spadices surrounded by a showy spathe, which are its primary floral structures. Anthurium crenatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering habits."
