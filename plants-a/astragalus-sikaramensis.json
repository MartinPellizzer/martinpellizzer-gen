    "intro": "Astragalus sikaramensis, commonly known as the Kashmir sky-blue pea, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus sikaramensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
