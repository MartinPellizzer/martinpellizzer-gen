    "intro": "Artemisia ruderalis, commonly known as the western ragweed, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and small yellow flowers that appear in late summer. This plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, due to its adaptability to harsh environments. It has a strong, often unpleasant odor and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices. The plant is also a common allergen, contributing to seasonal hay fever symptoms."
