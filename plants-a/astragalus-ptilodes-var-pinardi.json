It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and open woodlands. Its compound leaves consist of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
