    "intro": "Anthurium chorranum, commonly known as the Andean flame, is a tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces vibrant red spadices, which are the inflorescences that house the small, white flowers. Anthurium chorranum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
