    "intro": "Ardisia carnea, commonly known as Christmasberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Ardisia carnea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
