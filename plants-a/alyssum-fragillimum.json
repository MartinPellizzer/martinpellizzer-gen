    "intro": "Alyssum fragillimum, commonly known as the brittle alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has delicate, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its fragility, it is often grown in containers to protect it from harsh weather conditions."
