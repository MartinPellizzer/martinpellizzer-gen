    "intro": "Aristolochia zollingeriana, commonly known as the Zollinger's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions despite its potential hazards."
