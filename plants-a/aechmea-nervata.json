    "intro": "Aechmea nervata, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture and prominent veins, giving it its scientific name. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in late spring or early summer. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
