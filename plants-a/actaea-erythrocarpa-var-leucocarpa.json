    "intro": "Actaea erythrocarpa var. leucocarpa, commonly known as white bloodroot, is a variant of the bloodroot plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a toxic sap that contains protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though with caution due to their toxicity. The white variant differs from the typical red-fruited form primarily in the color of its berries and the hue of its flowers.",
