    "intro": "Athyrium costulalisorum, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to East Asia. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This ornamental plant is popular in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor settings."
