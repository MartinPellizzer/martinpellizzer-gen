    "intro": "Anthurium alticola, commonly known as the mountain anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spathaceous flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting spadix. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium alticola is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
