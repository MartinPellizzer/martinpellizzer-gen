    "intro": "Alectoroctonum sanguineum, commonly known as the blood-red thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structure. The plant is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
