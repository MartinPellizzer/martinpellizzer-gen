    "intro": "Aspilia foliacea, commonly known as the African daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and has a compact, bushy habit with narrow, linear leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aspilia foliacea is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
