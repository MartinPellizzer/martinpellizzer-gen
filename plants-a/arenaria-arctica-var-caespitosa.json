    "intro": "Arenaria arctica var. caespitosa, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, cushion-like clusters, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, often white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
