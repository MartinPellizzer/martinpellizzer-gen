    "intro": "Aster glaucus, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its silvery-blue foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. Aster glaucus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and attracts pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
