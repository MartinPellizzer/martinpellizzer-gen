    "intro": "Athyrium polycarpum, commonly known as the fern with many seeds, is a species of polypody fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Athyrium polycarpum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions."
