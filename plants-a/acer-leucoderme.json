    "intro": "Acer leucoderme, commonly known as the white-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive white veins on its leaves, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The tree produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.",
