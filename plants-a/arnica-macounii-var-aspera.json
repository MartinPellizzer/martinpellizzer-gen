    "intro": "Arnica macounii var. aspera, commonly known as the rough arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or dissected. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Arnica macounii var. aspera is often found in alpine meadows and open forest clearings at high elevations."
