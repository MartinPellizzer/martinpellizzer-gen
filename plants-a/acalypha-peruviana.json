It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open areas or along stream banks. Acalypha peruviana is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones within Bolivia and Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha peruviana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, where it can become invasive if not managed properly. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful cultivation to prevent ecological disruption."
