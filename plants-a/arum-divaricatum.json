    "intro": "Arum divaricatum, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in the eastern United States. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a spatulate bract, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
