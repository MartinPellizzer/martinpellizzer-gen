    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria subsp. cryptolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and small, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered into sori surrounded by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. This subspecies is notable for its ability to tolerate low light conditions and is commonly used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
