    "intro": "Atriplex hastata var. microtheca, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Its low-growing habit and drought tolerance make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
