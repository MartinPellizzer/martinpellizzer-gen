    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. subramosum, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and bright green leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in early spring, releasing a subtle, honey-like fragrance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
