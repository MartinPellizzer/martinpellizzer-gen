    "intro": "Astragalus pubigerus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with numerous small, hairy leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in raceme clusters, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical seed pods. Astragalus pubigerus has adapted to survive in poor soils and harsh climates, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its ecosystem."
