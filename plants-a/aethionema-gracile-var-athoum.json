It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal.
