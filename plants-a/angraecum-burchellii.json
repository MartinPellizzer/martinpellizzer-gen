It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white flowers with prominent purple veins. The plant produces fragrant, nocturnal blooms that attract specific moths for pollination. Angraecum burchellii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
