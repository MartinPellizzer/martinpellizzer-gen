    "intro": "Argyroxiphium \u00d7 kai, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 silversword, is a hybrid plant native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its silver-green, sword-like leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower head that can range in color from yellow to red, depending on the variety. It thrives in the high-elevation, volcanic soils of the Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Due to its limited habitat and conservation status, it is considered a rare and protected species."
