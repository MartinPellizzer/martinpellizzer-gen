    "intro": "Andropogon schlumbergeri var. andreae, commonly known as the dwarf grass or Andean grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, tufted stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its flowering spikes are small and panicle-like, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form dense, attractive clumps."
