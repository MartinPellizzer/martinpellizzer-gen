    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax higoensis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, specifically regions such as Japan, Korea, and parts of China. It is commonly found in temperate forested areas, often growing in shaded undergrowth. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is typically associated with mountainous or hilly terrain. It is a climbing shrub that can reach significant heights, often using other vegetation for support. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax higoensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. It thrives in regions with moderate to high sunlight exposure and is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas. The plant is known for its attractive, palmate leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that appear in the spring. It has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific Rim, including Japan, South Korea, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and lack of widespread cultivation."
