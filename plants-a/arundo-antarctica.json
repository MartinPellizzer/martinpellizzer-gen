    "intro": "Arundo antarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic reed, is a tall, grass-like plant native to southern South America. It is characterized by its dense, fibrous growth and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles. It is often found in wetland areas and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, saline soils. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for thatching and basket-making."
