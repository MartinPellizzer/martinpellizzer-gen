    "intro": "Agrostis debilis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Agrostis debilis is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and soil-stabilizing properties."
