    "intro": "Amauropelta melanochlaena, commonly known as the black-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green with a leathery texture, and the stems are dark brown, giving it its common name. The reproductive structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
