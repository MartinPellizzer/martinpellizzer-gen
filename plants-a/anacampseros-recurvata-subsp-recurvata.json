It features fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
