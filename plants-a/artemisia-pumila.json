It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Artemisia pumila is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
