    "intro": "Asplenium gibertianum, commonly known as the Gibert's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often folded or twisted. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are usually located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium gibertianum is a relatively uncommon species, often found in specific geographic regions with particular microclimates."
