    "intro": "Arum repens, commonly known as the walking iris, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features a rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread vegetatively along the ground. The plant produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a showy spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Arum repens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshy areas or along stream banks."
