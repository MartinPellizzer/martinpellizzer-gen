    "intro": "Alchemilla trifolioidea, commonly known as the three-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they have three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Alchemilla trifolioidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in herbal medicine."
