    "intro": "Aethonia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale yellow. Aethonia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine."
