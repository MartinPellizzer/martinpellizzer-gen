    "intro": "Azalea tubiflora, commonly known as the swamp azalea, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are characteristic of the Rhododendron genus. Its leaves are elliptical and often have a waxy surface, and it is known for its ability to thrive in humid environments. Azalea tubiflora plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
