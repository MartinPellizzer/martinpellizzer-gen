    "intro": "Abies fargesii var. sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically cylindrical and measure up to 5 centimeters in length. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found at high elevations in forested areas. The Sichuan fir plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species and contributing to forest biodiversity.",

This variant of the firs is found in the mountainous regions of these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with high altitudes and moist conditions. The plant is commonly found in forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. It plays an important ecological role in the biodiversity of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies fargesii var. sutchuenensis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant. This variant is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate pollution. It has also been introduced to parts of North America and Europe for horticultural purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems if it escapes cultivation."
