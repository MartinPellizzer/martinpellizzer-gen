    "intro": "Anthurium coripatense, commonly known as the Coripata anthurium, is a species native to the cloud forests of Peru. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium coripatense is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in traditional medicine in its native region."
