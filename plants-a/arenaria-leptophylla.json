    "intro": "Arenaria leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, helping to retain moisture in dry environments. Arenaria leptophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
