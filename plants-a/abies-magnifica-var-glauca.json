    "intro": "Abies magnifica var. glauca, commonly known as the white fir, is a variant of the grand fir native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance in both winter and summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical grand fir. It produces cones that are usually reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This evergreen tree thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions.",

This variant of the white fir is found in high elevation areas, typically above 2,000 meters. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly found in mixed coniferous forests. Its distribution is limited to specific regions in California and Oregon.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies magnifica var. glauca was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates, typically in higher elevation regions. It is often found in mountainous landscapes where it thrives in partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities, including its blue-green foliage and pyramidal shape. It has been introduced to parts of the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
