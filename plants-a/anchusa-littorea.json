    "intro": "Anchusa littorea, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial herb native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its flowers are tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anchusa littorea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
