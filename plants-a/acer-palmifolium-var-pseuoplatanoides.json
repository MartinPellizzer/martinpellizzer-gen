    "intro": "Acer palmifolium var. pseuoplatanoides, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking foliage and graceful form.",
