    "intro": "Agropyron parishii, commonly known as the Parry's needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Agropyron parishii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
