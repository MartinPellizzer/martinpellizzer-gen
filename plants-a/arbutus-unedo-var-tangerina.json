    "intro": "Arbutus unedo var. tangerina, commonly known as the tangerina bearberry, is a variant of the common bearberry native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and small, orange-red berries that are edible. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland edges. The berries of this variety are smaller and more intensely flavored compared to the typical bearberry."
