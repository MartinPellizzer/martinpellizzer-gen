    "intro": "Astragalus brachystachys var. argenteus, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
