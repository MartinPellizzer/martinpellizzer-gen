    "intro": "Angraecum corrugatum, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a climbing epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, twisted stems with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its unique zigzag growth pattern helps it climb and secure itself to trees in its native habitat. Angraecum corrugatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
