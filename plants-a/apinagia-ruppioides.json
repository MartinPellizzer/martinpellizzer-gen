It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
