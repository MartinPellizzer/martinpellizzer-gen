This species is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It thrives in the humid, tropical climates of these areas. Abarema kiahii is typically found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is a member of the legume family and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema kiahii was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. This plant is often found in disturbed environments due to its ability to establish quickly and tolerate poor soil conditions. It has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil and Colombia. Its introduction is primarily associated with human activities such as land clearing and agricultural expansion."
