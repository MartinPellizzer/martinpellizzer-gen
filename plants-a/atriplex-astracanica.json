    "intro": "Atriplex astracanica, commonly known as Russian thornweed, is a perennial shrub native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in dry, coastal areas. Atriplex astracanica is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
