The plant has small, pinnately compound leaves and is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats, thriving in salty and well-drained environments. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing nectar for pollinators."
