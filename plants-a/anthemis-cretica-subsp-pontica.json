It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, finely divided leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and forest edges. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, glandular hairs that contribute to its distinctive scent. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the nominate form of Anthemis cretica."
