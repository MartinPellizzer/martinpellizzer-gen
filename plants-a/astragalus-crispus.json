    "intro": "Astragalus crispus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a hairy texture and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Astragalus crispus has medicinal uses in traditional herbal medicine and is also valued for its role in ecological restoration projects."
