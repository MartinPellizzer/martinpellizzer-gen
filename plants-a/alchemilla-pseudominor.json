    "intro": "Alchemilla pseudominor, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla pseudominor is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its ability to tolerate partial shade."
