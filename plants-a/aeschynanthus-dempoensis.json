    "intro": "Aeschynanthus dempoensis, commonly known as the Dempo violet, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of West Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its foliage is often glossy and dark green, with leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape. Aeschynanthus dempoensis is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses due to its specific humidity and light requirements."
