    "intro": "Astrebla squarrosa, commonly known as the mulga grass, is a perennial grass native to Australia. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dry open woodlands and plains. The plant has wiry, upright stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and tough, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Astrebla squarrosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for native animals."
