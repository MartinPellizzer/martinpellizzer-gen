    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and produces a single, showy, white to pinkish flower with a yellow center. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
