    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of silver-gray foliage with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The flowers bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
