    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha nigritiana is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests and along riverbanks. This plant is also present in parts of Madagascar and the island of Socotra. It is commonly found in lowland areas with high humidity and well-drained soils. Acalypha nigritiana is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha nigritiana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been introduced to several countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have led to its naturalization in some areas. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is cultivated."
