    "intro": "Aconitum talassicum var. villosulum, commonly known as the coastal aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence, giving the plant its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky shores. This plant is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it a hazardous species to handle.",
