    "intro": "Andropogon hirsutus var. pubescens, commonly known as hairy bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and inflorescence that consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, blue-gray flowers. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
