It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum flexicaule is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
