    "intro": "Athyrium viridifrons, commonly known as the green-fronded wood fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for cultivation in shaded gardens and greenhouses."
