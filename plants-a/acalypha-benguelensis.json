This plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments. It is commonly seen in forested areas and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Angola.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha benguelensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant has been reported in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
