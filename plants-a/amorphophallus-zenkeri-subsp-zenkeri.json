    "intro": "Amorphophallus zenkeri subsp. zenkeri, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces a tall, spathaceous inflorescence that can reach heights of over 5 meters, often with a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of rotting meat. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from underground tubers after flooding."
