    "intro": "Artemisia sieversiana var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf mugwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, forming dense mats of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in compact inflorescences. Its leaves are aromatic, with a strong, camphor-like scent, and are covered in fine, hairy structures. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
