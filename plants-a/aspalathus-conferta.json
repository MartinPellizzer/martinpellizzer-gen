    "intro": "Aspalathus conferta, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a flowering plant native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its role in the production of rooibos tea, although it is not the primary species used for this purpose. Aspalathus conferta thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various insect and bird species."
