    "intro": "Acacia cowleana, commonly known as the Christmas tree acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces fluffy, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions. Acacia cowleana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cowleana is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cowleana was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, dry climate, often found in regions with low rainfall. It is commonly established in disturbed or degraded lands, such as roadsides, agricultural fields, and abandoned pastures. This plant thrives in full sun and is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to its spread in several parts of Australia and other regions with similar environmental conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
