    "intro": "Allium dentiferum, commonly known as the toothed leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces a flower stalk that bears small, white, bell-shaped flowers arranged in a loose cluster. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable crop in some regions. Allium dentiferum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and flowering habit."
