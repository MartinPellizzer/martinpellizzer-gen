    "intro": "Astragalus arganaticus, commonly known as the Arganat flowering plant, is a species of legume native to the arid regions of North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are typically small and compound, and it produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain seeds. Astragalus arganaticus plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
