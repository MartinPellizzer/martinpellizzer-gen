    "intro": "Aria rostellata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-like structure formed by the fusion of the sepals and petals, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and fragrant, with a complex arrangement of colors and patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, Aria rostellata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
