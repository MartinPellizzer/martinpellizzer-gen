    "intro": "Amerina glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky nightshade, is a herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Botanically, it belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers."
