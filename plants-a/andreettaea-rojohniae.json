    "intro": "Andreettaea rojohniae, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a rare and critically endangered species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its tonal qualities in musical instruments. The plant has small, glossy leaves and produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by red berries. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now found only in a few isolated locations. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique species."
