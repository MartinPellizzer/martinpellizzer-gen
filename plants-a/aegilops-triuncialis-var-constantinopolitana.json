    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. constantinopolitana, commonly known as the Constantinople wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often used in traditional medicine and as a forage crop. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of wild relatives of cultivated wheat."
