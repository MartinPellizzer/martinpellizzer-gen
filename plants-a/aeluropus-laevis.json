It typically grows in saline or alkaline soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline habitats. Aeluropus laevis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
