    "intro": "Astragalus rudimentus, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow or greenish flowers and trifoliate leaves. This species is native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Astragalus rudimentus typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
