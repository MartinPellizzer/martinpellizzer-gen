It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with a distinctive central spur. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees and derives its nutrients from the air, rain, and debris around it. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and good air circulation. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
