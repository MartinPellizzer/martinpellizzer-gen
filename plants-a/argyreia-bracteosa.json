    "intro": "Argyreia bracteosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
