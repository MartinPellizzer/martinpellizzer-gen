    "intro": "Astragalus cobrensis var. cobrensis, commonly known as the Cobren's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing desert ecosystems."
