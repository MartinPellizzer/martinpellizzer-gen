    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia donnaiensis is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea. It is found in the dry, rocky habitats of Socotra, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid conditions. This species is endemic to Socotra, meaning it is not found naturally anywhere else in the world. It is often found growing on limestone substrates and in coastal areas. Due to its unique appearance and restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable component of Socotra's flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia donnaiensis was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, dry climate and well-drained soils, typically found in regions of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This species has shown a high capacity for spreading through seed dispersal by wind and animals. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is now considered a weed in some regions where it has been introduced."
