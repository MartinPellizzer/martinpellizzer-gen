    "intro": "Aloe horombensis subsp. andavakana, commonly known as the Andavakana aloe, is a rare succulent plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions and low rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
