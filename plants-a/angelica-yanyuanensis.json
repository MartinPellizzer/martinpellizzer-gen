    "intro": "Angelica yanyuanensis, commonly known as the Yanyuan angelica, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of China, specifically in Yunnan Province, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which appear in umbels, are typically white or pale green, and it produces small, oily seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Angelica yanyuanensis is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical research."
