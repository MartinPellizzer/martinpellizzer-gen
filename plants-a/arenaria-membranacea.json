    "intro": "Arenaria membranacea, commonly known as the membranous sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in a thin, waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
