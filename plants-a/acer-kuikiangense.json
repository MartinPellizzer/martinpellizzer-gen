    "intro": "Acer kuikiangense, commonly known as the Kuijiang maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10-15 meters and is often found in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and green, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow fissures that become more pronounced as the tree matures.",
