    "intro": "Anneslia penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging flower or pendulous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Anneslia penduliflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to cascade from containers or hanging baskets."
