    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata var. tatrensis, commonly known as the Tatran sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is noted for its resilience to cold temperatures and is often used in rock gardens or as a hardy ornamental plant."
