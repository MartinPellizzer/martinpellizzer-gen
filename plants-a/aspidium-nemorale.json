    "intro": "Aspidium nemorale, commonly known as the wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium nemorale has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in forest ecosystems."
