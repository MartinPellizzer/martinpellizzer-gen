    "intro": "Agave oliveriana, commonly known as Oliver's agave, is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white marginal teeth. The plant produces a tall flower stalk bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late summer or early fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
