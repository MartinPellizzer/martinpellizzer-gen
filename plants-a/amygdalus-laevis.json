    "intro": "Amygdalus laevis, commonly known as the smooth almond, is a deciduous tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces fragrant white flowers in early spring, followed by the development of small, green fruits that mature into the edible almonds. The seeds, or kernels, are encased in a hard shell and are widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. It is closely related to the peach and cherry trees within the Prunus genus."
