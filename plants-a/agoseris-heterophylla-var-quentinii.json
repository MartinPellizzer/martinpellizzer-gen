    "intro": "Agoseris heterophylla var. quentinii, commonly known as Quentin's agoseris, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is a perennial herb that is often found in disturbed soils and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
