It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, with a distinctive cup-shaped structure. The plant produces a single, prominent flower per stem, which blooms in late summer or early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine, silvery down. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in cooler, high-altitude gardens."
