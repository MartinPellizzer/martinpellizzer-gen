    "intro": "Aeschynanthus camiguinensis, commonly known as the Camiguin bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
