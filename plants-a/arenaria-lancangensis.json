    "intro": "Arenaria lancangensis, commonly known as the Lancang sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
