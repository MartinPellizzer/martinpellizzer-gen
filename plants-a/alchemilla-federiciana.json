    "intro": "Alchemilla federiciana, commonly known as the rock alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, inconspicuous white flowers that appear in early summer, typically clustered in umbels. Its leaves are broadly ovate and covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which give them a distinctive appearance. Alchemilla federiciana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
