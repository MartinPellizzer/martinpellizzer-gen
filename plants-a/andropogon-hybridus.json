    "intro": "Andropogon hybridus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. Switchgrass thrives in a variety of soil types and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant adapted to temperate climates. It is widely cultivated for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements. Additionally, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting wildlife."
