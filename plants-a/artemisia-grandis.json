It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Artemisia grandis plays a vital role in supporting wildlife and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
