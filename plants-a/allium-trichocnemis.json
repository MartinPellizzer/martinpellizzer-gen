    "intro": "Allium trichocnemis, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features strap-like, gray-green leaves covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable addition to gardens. Allium trichocnemis is often found in rocky or dry soils and is well adapted to Mediterranean climates."
