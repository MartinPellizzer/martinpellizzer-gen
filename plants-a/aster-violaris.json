    "intro": "Aster violaris, commonly known as the violet aster, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces showy, violet-blue flowers with a central disk. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Aster violaris is often found in meadows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight."
