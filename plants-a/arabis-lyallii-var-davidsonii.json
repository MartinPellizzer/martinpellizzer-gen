    "intro": "Arabis lyallii var. davidsonii, commonly known as the Davidson's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It features basal rosettes of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
