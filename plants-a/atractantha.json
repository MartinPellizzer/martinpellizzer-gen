    "intro": "Atractantha, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are often narrow and grayish-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Atractantha produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
