It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to blue flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a hairy texture, and its stems are often reddish in color. Aster tubuliflorus plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
