    "intro": "Andropogon torreyanus, commonly known as Torrey's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spike-like clusters, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon torreyanus plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
