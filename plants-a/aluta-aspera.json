    "intro": "Aluta aspera, commonly known as the rough aluta, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a similar rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aluta aspera is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
