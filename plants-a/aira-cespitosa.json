    "intro": "Aira cespitosa, commonly known as purple lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil make it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
