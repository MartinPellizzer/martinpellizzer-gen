    "intro": "Alsophila vernicosa, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that give it a lush, ornamental appearance. The plant has a robust trunk that is covered with a layer of spongy, brownish tissue, which helps retain moisture. Its fronds are typically fan-shaped and can grow quite large, contributing to its dramatic visual presence. Alsophila vernicosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
