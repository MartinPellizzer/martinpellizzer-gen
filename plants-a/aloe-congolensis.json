    "intro": "Aloe congolensis, commonly known as the Congo aloe, is a succulent plant native to Central Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it store water. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, often blooming in the spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its purported medicinal properties. Aloe congolensis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
