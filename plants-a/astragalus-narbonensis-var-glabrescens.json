    "intro": "Astragalus narbonensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Narbonne milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. This variety is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) appearance, particularly on the stems and leaves, which sets it apart from other varieties of Astragalus. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and shrublands."
