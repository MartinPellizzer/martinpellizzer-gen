    "intro": "Amasonia arborea, commonly known as the evergreen tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense canopy of broad, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the tree is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its aesthetic appeal. Amasonia arborea also has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat."
