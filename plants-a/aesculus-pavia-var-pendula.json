    "intro": "Aesculus pavia var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping horse chestnut, is a striking ornamental tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its cascading clusters of bright red, showy flowers that appear in the spring. The plant has palmately lobed, dark green leaves that provide a lush canopy throughout the growing season. Its fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule that contains several chestnut-like seeds. This variety is prized for its unique, drooping appearance and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
