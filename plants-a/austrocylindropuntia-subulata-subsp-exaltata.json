    "intro": "Austrocylindropuntia subulata subsp. exaltata, commonly known as the tall spiny cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and sharp, spiny areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. Its adaptations include a thick cuticle and succulent stems to store water, enabling it to thrive in dry environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xerophytic gardens."
