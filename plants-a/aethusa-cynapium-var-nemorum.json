    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium var. nemorum, commonly known as the wood anise or narrow-leaved cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The leaves are compound, with finely divided, feathery lobes, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. It thrives in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, often growing in partial shade. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its seeds, and has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
