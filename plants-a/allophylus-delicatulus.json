    "intro": "Allophylus delicatulus, commonly known as the delicate alderleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. The plant features elliptical, leathery leaves that are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, spherical fruits. Allophylus delicatulus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings for its compact growth and foliage."
