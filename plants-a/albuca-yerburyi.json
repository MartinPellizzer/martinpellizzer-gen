It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in poor soil conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in gardens."
