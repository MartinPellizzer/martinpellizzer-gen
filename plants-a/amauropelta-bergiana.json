    "intro": "Amauropelta bergiana, commonly known as the Bergian shield fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are tightly curled when young and unfurl gradually as the plant matures. The plant's leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it survive in its cool and humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
