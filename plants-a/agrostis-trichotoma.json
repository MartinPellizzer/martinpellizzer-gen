    "intro": "Agrostis trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis trichotoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
