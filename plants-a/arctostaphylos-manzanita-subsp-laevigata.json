    "intro": "Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and evergreen, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular plant in native landscaping and restoration projects."
