    "intro": "Alsophila atrovirens subsp. verruculosa, commonly known as the black fern, is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a medium-sized tree fern characterized by its robust trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The fronds are typically dark green with a leathery texture and often bear small, rounded spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
