    "intro": "Aconitum degenii var. laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorum variety of Degen's aconite, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
