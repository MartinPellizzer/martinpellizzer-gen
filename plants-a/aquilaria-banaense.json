    "intro": "Aquilaria banaense, commonly known as the Bornean agarwood tree, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant produces a unique type of resin called gaharu, which is formed in response to fungal infections or injuries. Aquilaria banaense typically grows as a tall evergreen tree, reaching heights of up to 30 meters. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
