    "intro": "Avicennia bicolor, commonly known as the mangrove buttonwood, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline environments. It thrives in intertidal zones, where it tolerates periodic submersion and high salinity. The plant has specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which aid in oxygen uptake in waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Avicennia bicolor plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
