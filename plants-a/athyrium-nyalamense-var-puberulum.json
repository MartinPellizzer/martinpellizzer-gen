    "intro": "Athyrium nyalamense var. puberulum, commonly known as the Nyalam fern, is a variant of the Athyrium genus native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across suitable habitats. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
