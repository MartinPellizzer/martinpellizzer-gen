    "intro": "Aureolaria grandiflora var. cinerea, commonly known as the silverleaf sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-arid conditions. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
