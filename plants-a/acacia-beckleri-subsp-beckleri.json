This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It typically grows in open woodlands, shrublands, and rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate and can thrive in poor soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific geographic regions mentioned.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia beckleri subsp. beckleri was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, typically found in regions with low to moderate rainfall. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands, rocky outcrops, and disturbed sites. This subspecies is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it adaptable to various environments. It is often used in reforestation and erosion control due to its hardy nature. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
