    "intro": "Ardisia phaeoneura, commonly known as the golden-leaf ardisia, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often display a striking golden or yellowish tinge on the underside. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
