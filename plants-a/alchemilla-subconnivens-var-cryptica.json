    "intro": "Alchemilla subconnivens var. cryptica, commonly known as the cryptic lady's mantle, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the lady's mantle genus. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and features small, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
