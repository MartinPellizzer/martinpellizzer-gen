    "intro": "Adiantum burnii, commonly known as the Persian maidenhair fern, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Afghanistan. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other maidenhair ferns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil. Its fronds are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive blackish midrib that contrasts with the lighter green pinnae. Adiantum burnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant appearance.",
