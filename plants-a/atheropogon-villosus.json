    "intro": "Atheropogon villosus, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. Atheropogon villosus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
