    "intro": "Aristida venustula var. venustuloides, commonly known as the showy beardgrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, wiry stems and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, but the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions. It is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for wildlife."
