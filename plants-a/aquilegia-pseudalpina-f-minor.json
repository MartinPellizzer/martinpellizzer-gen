    "intro": "Aquilegia pseudalpina f. minor, commonly known as the Alpine columbine, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, spurred petals that range in color from deep purple to pale blue. This plant typically grows in high-altitude alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with finely serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
