    "intro": "Alchemilla rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of rounded, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
