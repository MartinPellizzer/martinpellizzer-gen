    "intro": "Aspidopterys concava var. philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine aspidopterys, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds with a distinctive, concave shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as montane forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
