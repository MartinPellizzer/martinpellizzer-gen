    "intro": "Avena sativa var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower oat, is a variant of the common oat characterized by its unique floral structure. This plant typically produces a single, elongated inflorescence with a cluster of spikelets, distinguishing it from the more common multi-flowered oat varieties. It is native to temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. The plant's botanical features include slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its seed heads are often used in ornamental gardening due to their aesthetic appeal and ecological value for pollinators."
