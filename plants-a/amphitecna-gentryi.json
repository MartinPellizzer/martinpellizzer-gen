    "intro": "Amphitecna gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are often hidden within a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
