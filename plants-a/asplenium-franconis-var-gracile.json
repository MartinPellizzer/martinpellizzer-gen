    "intro": "Asplenium franconis var. gracile, commonly known as the slender rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or under forest canopies. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
