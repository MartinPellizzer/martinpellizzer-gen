    "intro": "Armeria maritima f. anisophylla, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a flowering plant characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and evergreen foliage. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early summer. This cultivar is notable for its distinct leaf morphology, with anisophyllous leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. The plant is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative ground cover due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
