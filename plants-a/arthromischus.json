    "intro": "Arthromischus, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. The plants typically have succulent leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Arthromischus species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and the ability to store water in their leaves. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are of interest in ecological studies due to their resilience in extreme climates."
