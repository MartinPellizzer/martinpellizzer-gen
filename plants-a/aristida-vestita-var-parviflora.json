    "intro": "Aristida vestita var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and sandy soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
