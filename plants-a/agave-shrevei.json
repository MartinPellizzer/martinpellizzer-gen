    "intro": "Agave shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve's agave, is a perennial succulent native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are often lined with sharp spines. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale yellow flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Agave shrevei is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
