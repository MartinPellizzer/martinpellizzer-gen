    "intro": "Alisma subcordatum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and stream edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette at the base, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are typically pollinated by insects. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other varieties of Alisma subcordatum."
