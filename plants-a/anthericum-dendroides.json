    "intro": "Anthericum dendroides, commonly known as the tree fern, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem that resembles a tree, covered with a fibrous, dark brown rind. The plant produces a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures include a central fiddlehead that develops into a spore-bearing cone. Anthericum dendroides is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests."
