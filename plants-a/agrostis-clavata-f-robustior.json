    "intro": "Agrostis clavata f. robustior, commonly known as the robust bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass genus native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. This subspecies is characterized by its robust growth habit and dense, low-growing foliage. It typically forms a mat-like structure, making it suitable for ground cover in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. Botanically, it is distinguished by its elongated, slender leaves and its ability to thrive in shaded environments."
