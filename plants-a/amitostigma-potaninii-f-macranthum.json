    "intro": "Amitostigma potaninii f. macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered amitostigma, is a rare and delicate alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its high-altitude habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are densely packed, helping it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
