It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its anti-inflammatory and astringent effects. Alchemilla purohitii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
