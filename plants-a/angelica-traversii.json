It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, compound leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by oval, dark brown seeds.

It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or meadow habitats."
