It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically white to pale green on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it prefers moist, well-drained soils. This species is often found in riparian areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits.",
