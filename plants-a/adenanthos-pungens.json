    "intro": "Adenanthos pungens, commonly known as the sharp-leaf adenanthos, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens.",
