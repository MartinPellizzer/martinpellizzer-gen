    "intro": "Anthurium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf peace lily, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, and pointed leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of white, yellow, or red. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium angustifolium is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
