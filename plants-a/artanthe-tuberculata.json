    "intro": "Artanthe tuberculata, commonly known as the cushion artanthe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high elevations of South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly coating. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to harsh alpine conditions. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
