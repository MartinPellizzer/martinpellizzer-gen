    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. gormannii, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It typically features dense clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subalpine habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
