    "intro": "Apochloa, commonly known as the false grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. These plants typically have slender, grass-like foliage and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Apochloa species are often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. They are generally not cultivated for agricultural purposes but are of interest in botanical studies due to their unique morphological features."
