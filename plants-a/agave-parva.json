    "intro": "Agave parva, commonly known as the dwarf agave, is a species of flowering plant in the Asparagaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. It produces a tall flowering stalk with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Agave parva is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
