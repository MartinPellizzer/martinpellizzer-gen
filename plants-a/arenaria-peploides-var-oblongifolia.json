    "intro": "Arenaria peploides var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming from spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is distinguished by its broader, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form of Arenaria peploides. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
