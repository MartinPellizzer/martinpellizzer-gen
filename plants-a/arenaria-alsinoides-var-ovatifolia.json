    "intro": "Arenaria alsinoides var. ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaved sandflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
