    "intro": "Aster ericoides f. villosus, commonly known as the hairy heath aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist woodlands or heathlands. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
