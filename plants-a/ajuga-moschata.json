    "intro": "Ajuga moschata, commonly known as sweet cicely, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, aromatic leaves that emit a mild, sweet scent when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common garden weed. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
