    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon septemlobum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Texas. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, including desert scrub and rocky soils. It is commonly associated with areas having a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Abutilon septemlobum is often found in disturbed sites and along roadsides in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon septemlobum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its showy flowers and unique foliage. It has been introduced in several regions, including parts of the United States and Australia. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
