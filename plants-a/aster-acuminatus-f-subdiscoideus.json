    "intro": "Aster acuminatus f. subdiscoideus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aster, is a botanical variant characterized by its finely toothed, linear leaves and compact growth habit. It typically produces small, daisy-like flowers with blue to purple petals, blooming in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is native to the northeastern United States and thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its foliage is often more elongated and narrower compared to the typical form of Aster acuminatus. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
