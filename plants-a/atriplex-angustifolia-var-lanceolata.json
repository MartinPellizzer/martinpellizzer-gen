    "intro": "Atriplex angustifolia var. lanceolata, commonly known as saltbush or shadscale, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It has narrow, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt-tolerant hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to thrive in saline soils and can tolerate extreme drought conditions. Its deep root system allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
