    "intro": "Aerangis hologlottis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, thick stem with a single, showy flower that blooms once a year. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, Aerangis hologlottis is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation efforts."
