    "intro": "Armeria duriensis subsp. sublittorea, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and succulent, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal dunes and along the edges of tidal pools, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats."
