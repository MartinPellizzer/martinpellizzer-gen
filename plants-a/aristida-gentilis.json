    "intro": "Aristida gentilis, commonly known as the slender threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous bristle-tipped florets. It is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
