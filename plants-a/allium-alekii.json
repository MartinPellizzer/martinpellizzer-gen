    "intro": "Allium alekii, commonly known as the Siberian chive or rock leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are grass-like and narrow, with a strong garlic scent, and produces small, spherical flower clusters in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild onion flavor, making it a valuable addition to culinary and medicinal uses. Allium alekii is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
