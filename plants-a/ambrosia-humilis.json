    "intro": "Ambrosia humilis, commonly known as the common ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically alternate along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are wind-pollinated and contribute to its reputation as an allergen. Ambrosia humilis thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its life cycle is adapted to temperate climates, with flowering typically occurring in late summer and early fall."
