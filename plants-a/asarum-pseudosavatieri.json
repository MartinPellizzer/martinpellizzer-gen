    "intro": "Asarum pseudosavatieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wild betony, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and clusters of greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional Chinese medicine."
