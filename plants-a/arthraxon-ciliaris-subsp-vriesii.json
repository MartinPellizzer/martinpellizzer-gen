It typically grows in wetland and marshy environments, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with a distinctive blue-green hue, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed flowers. This subspecies is often found in wet meadows and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in aquatic habitats."
