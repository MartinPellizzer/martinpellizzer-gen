    "intro": "Alsophila modesta, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant grows slowly, often reaching heights of up to 10 meters, and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the growth of its expansive frond structure. Alsophila modesta plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
