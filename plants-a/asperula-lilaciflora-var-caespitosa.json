    "intro": "Asperula lilaciflora var. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features dense, compact growth habit with small, dark green leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-lavender flowers in early spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a groundcover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thick mats, providing both visual appeal and erosion control."
