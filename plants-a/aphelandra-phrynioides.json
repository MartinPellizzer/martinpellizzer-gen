It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a slight waxy texture. The plant is prized for its vibrant, spathiflorous inflorescences that resemble torches, with bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Aphelandra phrynioides is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
