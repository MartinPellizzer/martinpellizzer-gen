    "intro": "Andromeda calyculata, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, dark green foliage with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its berries are red and contain toxic seeds, which are a food source for certain birds. Andromeda calyculata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
