    "intro": "Andrachne telephioides var. brevifolia, commonly known as the shortleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, ovate, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
