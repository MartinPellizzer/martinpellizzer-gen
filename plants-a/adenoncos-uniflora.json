    "intro": "Adenoncos uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower adenoncos, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly in parts of Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its unique, solitary pink or purple flower that blooms during the cooler months. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Adenoncos uniflora is considered a vulnerable species.",
