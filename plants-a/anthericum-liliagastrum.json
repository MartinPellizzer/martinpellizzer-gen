    "intro": "Anthericum liliagastrum, commonly known as the broad-leaved duck's foot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct basal rosette structure. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a loose umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded habitats. Anthericum liliagastrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
