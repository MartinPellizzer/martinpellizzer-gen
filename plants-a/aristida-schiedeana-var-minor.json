    "intro": "Aristida schiedeana var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf threeawn, is a low-growing grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and the presence of bristle-like structures at the base of its flowers. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of desert and rocky habitats. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in dry environments."
