It is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its branched stems and small, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive central gland. Alkanna saxicola is adapted to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species suited to xerophytic conditions."
