    "intro": "Anapausia vespertilionis, commonly known as the evening bat plant, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique tubular flowers that open in the evening, adapting to the activity patterns of its pollinators, primarily bats. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that emit a mild fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or under the canopy of larger trees. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
