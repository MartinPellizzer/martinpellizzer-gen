    "intro": "Arachnorchis bryceana, commonly known as the Bryce Canyon spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the United States, specifically found in Utah's Bryce Canyon National Park. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in high-altitude environments, typically growing in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces intricate, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. Its small size and specialized habitat make it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological fragility, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
