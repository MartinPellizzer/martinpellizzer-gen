    "intro": "Acer stachyanthum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately compound leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow in the fall. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins that appear in early spring, and it produces samaras with two papery wings. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming furrowed with age, and the tree typically grows to a height of 20 to 40 feet.",
