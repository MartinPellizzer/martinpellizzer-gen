    "intro": "Aster salicifolius f. obliquus, commonly known as the oblique willowleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features slender, willow-like leaves that are lanceolate and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded or partially shaded areas. Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf morphology and ecological role in native ecosystems."
