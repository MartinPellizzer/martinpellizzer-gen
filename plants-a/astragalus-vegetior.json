    "intro": "Astragalus vegetior, commonly known as the greater milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pink pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus vegetior is often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
