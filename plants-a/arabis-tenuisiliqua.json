    "intro": "Arabis tenuisiliqua, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
