    "intro": "Azorella echinus, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing structure, forming a compact cushion-like shape that helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water and withstand strong winds. Azorella echinus is also known for its ability to survive extreme conditions, making it a resilient species in alpine and subantarctic habitats."
