    "intro": "Asclepias fruticosa, commonly known as the antelope horn milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milkweed species are important for the survival of monarch butterflies, as they serve as a host plant for their larvae. Additionally, the plant contains latex sap, which can be toxic if ingested."
