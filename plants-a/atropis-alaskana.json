    "intro": "Atropis alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska atropis, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine tundra environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Atropis alaskana is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in its native range."
