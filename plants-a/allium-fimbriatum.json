    "intro": "Allium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed onion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, leafless stems that bear clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Allium fimbriatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
