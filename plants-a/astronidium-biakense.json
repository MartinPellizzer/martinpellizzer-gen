    "intro": "Astronidium biakense, commonly known as the Biak wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the island of Biak in Indonesia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round, yellowish fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
