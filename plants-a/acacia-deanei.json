    "intro": "Acacia deanei, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which are grouped in dense, globular clusters. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and coastal areas. Acacia deanei is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia deanei is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. It is commonly found in the eastern regions of Australia, particularly in areas with sandy or loamy soils. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the climate of these regions, which includes both temperate and subtropical conditions. Acacia deanei is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia deanei was mainly introduced to New Guinea. It is a shrub or small tree native to Australia but has been introduced to various regions, including New Guinea. The plant is known for its distinctive, flat, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Its introduction to New Guinea has led to its establishment in some ecological zones, though it is not considered invasive in the region."
