    "intro": "Angiopteris mutata, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has long, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring it to the bottom of these habitats. Angiopteris mutata plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter and food for various aquatic organisms."
