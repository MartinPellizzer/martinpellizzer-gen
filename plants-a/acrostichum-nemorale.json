It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer called the rachis. The plant produces large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Acrostichum nemorale thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique structure and growth habit make it an important component of its native ecosystem.",
