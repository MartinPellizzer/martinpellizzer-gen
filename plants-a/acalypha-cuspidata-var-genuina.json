It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes found near water sources. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage. The plant's natural range extends into parts of Indonesia and Malaysia as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cuspidata var. genuina was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become naturalized in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, vacant lots, and coastal areas. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for the environmental conditions of Hawaii. It spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and human activity. Due to its aggressive growth, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and biodiversity."
