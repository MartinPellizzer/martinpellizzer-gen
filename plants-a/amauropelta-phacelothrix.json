    "intro": "Amauropelta phacelothrix, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and growth habits make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
