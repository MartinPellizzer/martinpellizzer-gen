    "intro": "Andropogon bourgaei, commonly known as the West Indian bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as dry forests, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in low-lying areas with well-drained soil. Its ecological role includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native range."
