    "intro": "Ammophila \u00d7 baltica, commonly known as the European beachgrass, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ammophila arenaria and Ammophila breviligula. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal environments, particularly on sandy beaches and dunes. The plant is characterized by its dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize sand and prevent erosion. Its leaves are narrow, blue-green in color, and its flowers are small, spike-like structures that produce wind-dispersed seeds. This plant plays a crucial role in dune formation and coastal habitat conservation."
