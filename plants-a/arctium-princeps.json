    "intro": "Arctium princeps, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant features a tall, slender stem with hairy leaves and produces purple to pinkish flower heads. Its most distinctive feature is the prickly, spiny bur that forms after flowering, which aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur. Arctium princeps is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils."
