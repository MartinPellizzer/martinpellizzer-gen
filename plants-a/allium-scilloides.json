    "intro": "Allium scilloides, commonly known as the woodland garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or purple flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its pungent odor, similar to garlic, due to the presence of sulfur compounds in its tissues. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade. Allium scilloides is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
