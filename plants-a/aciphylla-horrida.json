    "intro": "Aciphylla horrida, commonly known as the bristly spinifex, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the arid regions of southern Australia, where it thrives in harsh, sandy environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water and withstand strong winds. Its flowers, which appear in late spring, are small and yellow, clustered in a head-like structure. Aciphylla horrida plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
