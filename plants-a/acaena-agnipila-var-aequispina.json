    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena agnipila var. aequispina is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the mountainous regions of the Southern Alps. This variety grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. It is commonly associated with temperate rainforests and is often found in areas with high humidity. The plant is well adapted to the cool, wet climate of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena agnipila var. aequispina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a horticultural ornamental due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its prolific seed production contribute to its invasive nature. Efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and protect native plant communities."
