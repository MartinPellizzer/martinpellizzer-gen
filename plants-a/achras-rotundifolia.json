It is characterized by its large, round, waxy leaves and produces a fruit that is central to its ecological and economic significance. The fruit, which resembles a small bread loaf, is botanically classified as a syncarp, formed from the fusion of multiple berries. The tree's trunk is typically smooth and often develops a distinctive swollen base. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is well adapted to coastal and lowland environments.",
