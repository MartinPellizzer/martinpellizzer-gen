    "intro": "Alyssum asperum, commonly known as rough alyssum, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Alyssum asperum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
