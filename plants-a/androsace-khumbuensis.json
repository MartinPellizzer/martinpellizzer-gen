    "intro": "Androsace khumbuensis, commonly known as the Khumbu Androsace, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat in remote mountainous regions, it is relatively rare and faces threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
