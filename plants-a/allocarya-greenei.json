    "intro": "Allocarya greenei, commonly known as the Greene's Allocarya, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant features upright, branched stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, clustered flowers are typically greenish-white in color, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allocarya greenei is considered a vulnerable species."
