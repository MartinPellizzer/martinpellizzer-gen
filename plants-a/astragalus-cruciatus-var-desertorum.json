    "intro": "Astragalus cruciatus var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils along dry streambeds and in desert foothills."
