It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that are a striking shade of golden yellow. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves, followed by edible, coconut-like fruits. Its unique foliage makes it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture. The species is also valued for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
