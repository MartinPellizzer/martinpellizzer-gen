    "intro": "Astragalus nummularius var. trichopterus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central Asia. It is characterized by its small, rounded leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
