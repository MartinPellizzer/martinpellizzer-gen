    "intro": "Arnica wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving at high elevations. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is upright and often branched. Arnica wilsonii is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other arnica species."
