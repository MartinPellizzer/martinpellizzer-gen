    "intro": "Asplenium goeringianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moss-like spores. The plant typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, humid environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor conditions. Its rhizomes are short and thick, anchoring it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Asplenium goeringianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
