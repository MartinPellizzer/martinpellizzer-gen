    "intro": "Arachis giacomettii, commonly known as the Giacometti peanut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that give way to pods containing edible seeds, similar to other peanut species. It is adapted to warm climates and well-drained soils, making it suitable for cultivation in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in plant taxonomy and agricultural research."
