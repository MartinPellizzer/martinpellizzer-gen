    "intro": "Allium pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf onion or field garlic, is a small perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbs that are similar in appearance to onions but are much smaller. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Allium pumilum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
