    "intro": "Acer muliense, commonly known as the Muli maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It prefers well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, Acer muliense is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
