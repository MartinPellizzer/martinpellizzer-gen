    "intro": "Arenaria altaica, commonly known as the high alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria altaica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
