    "intro": "Angelonia procumbens, commonly known as the summer snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces vibrant clusters of tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-draining soil. Its long blooming period, from summer through fall, makes it a popular choice for garden borders and containers. Angelonia procumbens is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
