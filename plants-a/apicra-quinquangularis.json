    "intro": "Apicra quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled apicra, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive five-angled stem and small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
