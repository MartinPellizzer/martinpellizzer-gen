    "intro": "Aconitum neapolitanum, commonly known as the Naples monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, with distinctive hood-shaped petals and spurred tips. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a deep green color and a slightly hairy texture. Aconitum neapolitanum is known for its ornamental value in gardens but is also toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.",
