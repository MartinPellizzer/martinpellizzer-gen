    "intro": "Arthromeris indica, commonly known as the Indian arrowhead, is a tropical herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland environments. Arthromeris indica is often found in marshy areas and is adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils."
