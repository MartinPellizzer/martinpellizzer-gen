    "intro": "Arachniodes \u00d7 subreflexipinna, commonly known as the hybrid bamboo fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Arachniodes simplicior and Arachniodes rigidiuscula. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically arching and have a soft, airy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for tropical and subtropical landscapes."
