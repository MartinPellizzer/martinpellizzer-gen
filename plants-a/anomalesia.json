    "intro": "Anomalesia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its lack of leaves, relying solely on its roots for sustenance. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom once a year, typically in the summer months. Anomalesia thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found growing on the trunks of trees, known as an epiphytic growth habit. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
