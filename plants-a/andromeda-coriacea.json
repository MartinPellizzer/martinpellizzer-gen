    "intro": "Andromeda coriacea, commonly known as the Atlantic rose or coastal rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense, dark green foliage with a waxy texture, and its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pink, blooming in spring. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit, often forming thickets along rocky shores and dunes. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Andromeda coriacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
