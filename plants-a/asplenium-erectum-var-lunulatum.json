    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. lunulatum, commonly known as the moon's shadow fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a pale, waxy band along the midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and the sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in shaded gardens."
