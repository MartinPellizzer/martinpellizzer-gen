    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea, commonly known as the butterfly orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, contributing to its ecological significance. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, making it an important component of its native ecosystems."
