    "intro": "Avenella flexuosa subsp. afromontana, commonly known as the East African bent grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or decumbent growth habit, with slender, often curved stems that form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Avenella flexuosa subsp. afromontana is often found in rocky soils and is an important component of alpine vegetation in its native range."
