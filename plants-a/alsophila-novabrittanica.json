    "intro": "Alsophila novabrittanica, commonly known as the New Britain cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to the island of New Britain in the Solomon Islands. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its restricted range and habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
