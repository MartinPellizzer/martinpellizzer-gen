    "intro": "Astragalus chartaceus, commonly known as the paper milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Astragalus chartaceus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
