    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. micans, commonly known as the velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent and anti-inflammatory properties."
