    "intro": "Agave rigidissima, commonly known as the rigid agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It has a rosette growth habit, with each leaf radiating outward from the center. Agave rigidissima is adapted to hot, dry climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
