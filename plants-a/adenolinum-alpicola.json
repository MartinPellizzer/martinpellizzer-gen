    "intro": "Adenolinum alpicola, commonly known as the alpine adenolinum, is a rare and delicate plant species native to high-altitude regions of the Alps. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Adenolinum alpicola is considered endangered and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows.",
