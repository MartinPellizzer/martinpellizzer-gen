    "intro": "Alsophila smithii, commonly known as the Smith's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive crown of fertile fronds that produce spores, which are essential for its reproductive cycle. Its trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material that provides structural support and helps retain moisture. Alsophila smithii is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
