    "intro": "Aechmea maranguapensis, commonly known as the Maranguape bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central tank to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to purple, adding to its ornamental value. Its leaves are typically broad and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and provide some protection against intense sunlight. Aechmea maranguapensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rock surfaces in its natural habitat."
