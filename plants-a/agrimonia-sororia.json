    "intro": "Agrimonia sororia, commonly known as common agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as achenes. Agrimony has a long history of use in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
