    "intro": "Agrostis alba subvar. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf silvergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features slender, silver-gray blades with a fine texture, and its culms are often compressed and leafy at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale green to brown florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in wetlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
