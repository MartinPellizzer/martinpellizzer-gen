    "intro": "Atractantha radiata, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil efficiently. Atractantha radiata is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments."
