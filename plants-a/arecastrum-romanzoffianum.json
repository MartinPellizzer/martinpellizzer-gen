    "intro": "Arecastrum romanzoffianum, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark red wood that is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
