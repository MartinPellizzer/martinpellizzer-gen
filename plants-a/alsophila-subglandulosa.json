    "intro": "Alsophila subglandulosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its slender, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, brownish layer of old fronds. The plant produces a crown of large, pinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, giving it a distinctive, elegant appearance. Its spores are borne on the undersides of the fertile fronds, which are typically found at the tips of the plant. Alsophila subglandulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal."
