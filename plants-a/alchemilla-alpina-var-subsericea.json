    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. subsericea, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a distinctive white or pale green underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes."
