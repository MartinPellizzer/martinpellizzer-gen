    "intro": "Apera spica-venti subsp. intermedia, commonly known as windgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it an important component of ecological studies and a common weed in agricultural settings."
