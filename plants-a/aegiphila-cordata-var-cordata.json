    "intro": "Aegiphila cordata var. cordata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, red berries. It is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is considered a weed in parts of the United States."
