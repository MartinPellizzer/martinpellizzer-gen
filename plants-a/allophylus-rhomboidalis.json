It features simple, alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical berries that are red when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its dense, compact growth habit."
