    "intro": "Arenaria ionandra, commonly known as the Ionandra sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky and sandy soils of the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding delicate beauty to its arid habitat. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in loose, well-drained soils. Arenaria ionandra is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
