It grows in high-altitude regions within these mountain ranges. The plant thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas at elevations between 1,200 and 2,400 meters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. carpatica was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive conical shape and dense foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. This variety is also valued for its cold hardiness, making it suitable for temperate and subarctic climates. Its introduction has expanded its presence in regions where it was previously not native. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
