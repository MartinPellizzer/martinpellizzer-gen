It features small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access moisture deep in the soil. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
