    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pulchrum is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South America, including countries such as Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments. Its native range extends into parts of Central America as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pulchrum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal areas. It is commonly found in gardens and along the edges of forests. However, it is considered a potential weed in some environments due to its rapid growth and ability to spread."
