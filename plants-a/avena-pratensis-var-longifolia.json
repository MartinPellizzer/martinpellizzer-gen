    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. longifolia, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are edible and have been traditionally used in human and animal diets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks."
