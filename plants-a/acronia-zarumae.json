    "intro": "Acronia zarumae, commonly known as the Zarumae acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the spring. Acronia zarumae is adapted to cold and nutrient-poor soils, often growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
