    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 lobatocrenatum, commonly known as the hybrid lace fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium crenatum. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
