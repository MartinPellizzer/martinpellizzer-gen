    "intro": "Acinos arvensis subsp. eglandulosus, commonly known as the glandless field acino, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its leaves, setting it apart from other members of the genus.",
