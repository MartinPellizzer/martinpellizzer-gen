    "intro": "Aconitum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and its stems are usually hairy and upright. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
