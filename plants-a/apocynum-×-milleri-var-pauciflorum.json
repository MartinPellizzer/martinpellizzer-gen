    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 milleri var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dogbane, is a hybrid plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright stems and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically less numerous than in other dogbane species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially toxic to humans and animals."
