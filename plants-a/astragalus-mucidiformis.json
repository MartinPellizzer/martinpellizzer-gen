    "intro": "Astragalus mucidiformis, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its hairy leaves and sticky secretions help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
