    "intro": "Asplenium tenuisectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often pale green leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its fronds are usually short and compact, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of its leaves."
