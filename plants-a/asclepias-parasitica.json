    "intro": "Asclepias parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic milkweed, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant has reduced leaves and relies heavily on its host for water and certain minerals, while still performing photosynthesis to some extent. It produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers that attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees. Due to its parasitic nature and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
