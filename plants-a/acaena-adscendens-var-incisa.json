It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant typically grows in grasslands, shrublands, and along the edges of forests. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens var. incisa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes or as a weed. It has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
