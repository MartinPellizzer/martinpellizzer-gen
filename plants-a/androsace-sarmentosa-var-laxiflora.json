    "intro": "Androsace sarmentosa var. laxiflora, commonly known as the laxiflora sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats."
