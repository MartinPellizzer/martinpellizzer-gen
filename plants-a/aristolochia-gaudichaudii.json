    "intro": "Aristolochia gaudichaudii, commonly known as the New Caledonian birthwort, is a climbing vine native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often hidden within a swollen, leaf-like structure called a spathaceous bract. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family, known for its complex chemical compounds, some of which are used in traditional medicine. However, due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
