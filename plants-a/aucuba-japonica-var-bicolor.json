    "intro": "Aucuba japonica var. bicolor, commonly known as the Japanese spathiphyllum or variegated aucuba, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features glossy, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, creating a vibrant visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that attract birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is valued for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. This variety is relatively low maintenance and suitable for woodland gardens or as a foundation plant."
