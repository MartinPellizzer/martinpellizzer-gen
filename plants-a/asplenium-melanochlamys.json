    "intro": "Asplenium melanochlamys, commonly known as the black frond spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically narrow and elongated. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are pinnately divided, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside of the leaves."
