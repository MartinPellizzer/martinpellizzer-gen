    "intro": "Adiantum reniforme, commonly known as the Indian maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a heart or a kidney, hence its scientific name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Adiantum reniforme prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories.",
