    "intro": "Alliaria minutiflora, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters along the stems. Its root system is fibrous, and it spreads primarily through seeds dispersed by wind and animals. Alliaria minutiflora is also known for its pungent odor, reminiscent of garlic and mustard, which comes from compounds in its leaves and flowers."
