    "intro": "Agrostis cenisia, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are small and spike-like, appearing in late summer to early autumn. Agrostis cenisia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
