    "intro": "Austrocactus bertinii subsp. nobilis, commonly known as the noble brittle cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family native to southern South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
