    "intro": "Astragalus consentaneus, commonly known as the Texas milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces pods that contain several small, smooth seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus consentaneus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
