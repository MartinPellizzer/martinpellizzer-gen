    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 borealis, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the northwestern United States and southern Canada. It is characterized by its finely toothed, alternate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats. Alnus \u00d7 borealis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
