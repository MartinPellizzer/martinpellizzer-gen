    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata subsp. armerina, commonly known as Armenian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and succulent. It is characterized by its dense growth habit and ability to form mats, which helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
