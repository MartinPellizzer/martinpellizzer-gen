    "intro": "Alnus denticulata, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Alnus denticulata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment."
