    "intro": "Astragalus aegobromus var. longiscapus, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
