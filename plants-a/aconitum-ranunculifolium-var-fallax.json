    "intro": "Aconitum ranunculifolium var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax variety of the monkshood plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive and ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, care should be taken when handling this plant, as all parts contain potent alkaloids.",
