    "intro": "Aconitum carmichaelii var. fortunei, commonly known as Chinese aconite or monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking blue to purple spires of spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
