    "intro": "Aster ascendens var. armeriifolius, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, blue to purple composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
