    "intro": "Alchemilla pratensis f. autumnalis, commonly known as the autumnal lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer to early autumn, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
