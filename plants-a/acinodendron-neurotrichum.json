    "intro": "Acinodendron neurotrichum, commonly known as the velvetleaf acacia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with small, lance-shaped leaflets that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, branched clusters. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils, it is often considered an invasive species in certain areas.",
