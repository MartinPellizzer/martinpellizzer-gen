    "intro": "Alnus viridis subf. hirta, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub or small tree native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy stems and alternate, simple, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers that appear in early spring, followed by small, oval-shaped nuts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites. This species plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
