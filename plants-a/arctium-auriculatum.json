    "intro": "Arctium auriculatum, commonly known as the heart-leaved burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Arctium auriculatum thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in meadows."
