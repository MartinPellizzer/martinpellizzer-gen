    "intro": "Asperula aristata var. pirinica, commonly known as the Pirin azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
