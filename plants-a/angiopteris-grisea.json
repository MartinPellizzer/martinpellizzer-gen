    "intro": "Angiopteris grisea, commonly known as the gray fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a grayish underside. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris grisea is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
