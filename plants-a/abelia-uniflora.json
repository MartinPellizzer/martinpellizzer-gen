    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia uniflora is primarily native to Southeast China. It is commonly found in regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments within forests and along stream banks. It is known for its clusters of fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Its natural habitat supports a variety of local wildlife and contributes to the biodiversity of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia uniflora was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It was widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its ability to thrive in partial shade and its tolerance to various soil conditions. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its aesthetic appeal, Abelia uniflora is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has spread beyond cultivated areas. Its distribution is now documented in several states, particularly in the coastal and piedmont regions."
