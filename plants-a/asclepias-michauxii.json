It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias michauxii thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
