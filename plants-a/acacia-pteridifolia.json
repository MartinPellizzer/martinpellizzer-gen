    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pteridifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and open woodlands. This species is commonly associated with coastal and inland regions where it forms part of the local flora. It is well adapted to the hot and dry climate of its native range. The plant is known for its distinctive fern-like leaves and yellow flowers, which attract various pollinators.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pteridifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is known for its feathery foliage and yellow flowers, making it a popular ornamental species. However, it has also been reported to spread into native vegetation, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Its introduction is largely attributed to horticultural purposes and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
