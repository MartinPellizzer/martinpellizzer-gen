    "intro": "Alchemilla aphanes, commonly known as lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that forms a carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in narrow racemes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla aphanes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
