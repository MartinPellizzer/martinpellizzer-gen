    "intro": "Athyrium conilii var. oldhamii, commonly known as the Oldham's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to southern China. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern life cycle. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
