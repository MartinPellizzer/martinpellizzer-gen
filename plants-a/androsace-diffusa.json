    "intro": "Androsace diffusa, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters at the center of the rosette. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
