    "intro": "Arundo \u00d7 subulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf reed, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arundo donax and Arundo phyllosperma. It is a tall, perennial grass that typically grows in wetlands, riverbanks, and other moist environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and can reach heights of up to 3 meters. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and its rapid growth rate. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain regions."
