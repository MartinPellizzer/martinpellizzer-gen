    "intro": "Aligera mamillata, commonly known as the milkweed plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic to many animals. The plant typically has opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white. Aligera mamillata is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its wide distribution in suitable habitats."
