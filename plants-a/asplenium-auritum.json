    "intro": "Asplenium auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with small, ear-like lobes at the base. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, and is often found in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to surfaces, while its fronds are usually less than 10 cm in length. Asplenium auritum is a hardy plant that is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
