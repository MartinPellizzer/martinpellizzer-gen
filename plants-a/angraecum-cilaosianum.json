    "intro": "Angraecum cilaosianum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by moths, which are attracted to its strong fragrance. Angraecum cilaosianum is a valuable species in botanical research due to its ecological significance and conservation status."
