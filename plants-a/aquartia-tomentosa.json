    "intro": "[WRONG START] Aquadia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects. The plant has a dense covering of fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving water and is often found in ponds and marshes. Its unique adaptations allow it to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
