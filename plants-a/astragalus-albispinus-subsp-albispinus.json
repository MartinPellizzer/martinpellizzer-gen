    "intro": "Astragalus albispinus subsp. albispinus, commonly known as the white-spined milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or in ecological restoration projects."
