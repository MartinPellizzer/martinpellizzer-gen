    "intro": "Astragalus tergeminus, commonly known as three-sepal milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pods that contain three oval seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Astragalus tergeminus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is capable of fixing nitrogen through its root nodules. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
