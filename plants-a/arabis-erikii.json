    "intro": "Arabis erikii, commonly known as the Ericaceous Arabis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, woolly leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is cultivated in gardens and used in native plant restoration projects."
