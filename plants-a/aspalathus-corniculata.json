    "intro": "Aspalathus corniculata, commonly known as the African tea or rooibos, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its most notable feature is the unique, reddish-brown color of its leaves, which gives it the common name \"rooibos,\" meaning \"red bush\" in Afrikaans. The plant is also valued for its use in herbal teas, as its leaves contain no caffeine and are rich in antioxidants."
