    "intro": "Avena sativa, commonly known as oat, is a cereal grain native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is an annual grass that produces a cylindrical spike with small, awned flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has slender, hollow stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and the inflorescence consists of a compact cluster of spikelets. Oats are rich in nutrients, including fiber, protein, and various minerals, making them valuable in both agriculture and human nutrition."
