    "intro": "Acistoma, commonly known as the \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to South America, particularly the Andes region. The plants are herbaceous perennials, often characterized by their bell-shaped or tubular flowers that range in color from white to violet. They typically grow in moist, shaded environments and have fibrous root systems. Acistoma species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental flowers and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
