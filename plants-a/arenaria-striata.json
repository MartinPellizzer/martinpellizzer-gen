    "intro": "Arenaria striata, commonly known as the striped sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically linear and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria striata is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
