It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus iljinii is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
