    "intro": "Asplenium pseudonormale, commonly known as the false shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help anchor it to substrates. Its fronds are usually clustered at the base, with a distinctive, shield-like appearance that gives it its common name. Asplenium pseudonormale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
