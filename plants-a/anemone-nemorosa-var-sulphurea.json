    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. sulphurea, commonly known as the golden anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy tissue. The plant produces clusters of showy, saucer-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or golden in color. These flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
