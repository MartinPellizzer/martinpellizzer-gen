    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. virginianum, commonly known as the scarlet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow catkins, and it produces winged samaras for seed dispersal. The bark is smooth when young but becomes furrowed with age, adding to its aesthetic appeal.",
