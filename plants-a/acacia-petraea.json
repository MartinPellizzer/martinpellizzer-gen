    "intro": "Acacia petraea, commonly known as the rock acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, phyllodes that are often glandular and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical heads, which are typically visited by a variety of pollinators. Acacia petraea is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia petraea is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing on cliffs and outcrops. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of Queensland's inland areas. Acacia petraea plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia petraea was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been introduced to several countries in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Australia. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and providing habitat for local wildlife. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation."
