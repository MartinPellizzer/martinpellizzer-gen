    "intro": "Astragalus lagonyx, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus lagonyx is also noted for its ability to fix nitrogen, which benefits soil fertility in its ecosystem."
