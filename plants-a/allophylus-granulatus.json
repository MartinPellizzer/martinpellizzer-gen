    "intro": "Allophylus granulatus, commonly known as the rough-leaved alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, granular texture on the leaves, which gives it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture. Allophylus granulatus produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife."
