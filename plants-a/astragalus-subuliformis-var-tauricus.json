    "intro": "Astragalus subuliformis var. tauricus, commonly known as the Tauric needlepod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or loamy soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-arid environments. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
