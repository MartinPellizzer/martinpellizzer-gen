    "intro": "Asperella americana, commonly known as the American asperella, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, sandy soils. Asperella americana is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological role in its native habitat."
