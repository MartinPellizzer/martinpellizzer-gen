It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive hooked shape at the tips of the pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
