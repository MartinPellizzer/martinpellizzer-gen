    "intro": "Anemone \u00d7 devinensis, commonly known as the hybrid anemone, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is a cross between *Anemone nemorosa* and *Anemone coronaria*, resulting in a plant with distinctive, showy flowers. The botanical features include palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy, and flowers that range from white to pink, often with a purple or red center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
