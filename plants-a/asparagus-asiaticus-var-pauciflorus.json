It features thin, wiry stems that often grow in dense clusters, forming a low shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in panicles, which are typically less abundant compared to other asparagus varieties. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and adaptability to various soil conditions."
