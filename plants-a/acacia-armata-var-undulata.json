    "intro": "Acacia armata var. undulata, commonly known as the undulating wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia armata var. undulata is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the regions of the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops, gravelly soils, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia armata var. undulata was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements. It has been introduced in various parts of Australia and some regions of the Mediterranean. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain environments."
