    "intro": "Aira lagascae, commonly known as the mountain air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant species."
