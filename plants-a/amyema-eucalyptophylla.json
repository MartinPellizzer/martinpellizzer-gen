    "intro": "Amyema eucalyptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to sandy soils and coastal environments, often growing in heathlands or open forests. Amyema eucalyptophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its unique foliage and resilience."
