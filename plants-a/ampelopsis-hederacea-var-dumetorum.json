    "intro": "Ampelopsis hederacea var. dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping grapes or the ground ivy vine, is a perennial vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
