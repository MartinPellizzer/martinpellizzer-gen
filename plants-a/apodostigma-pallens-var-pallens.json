It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. The plant has a short, upright stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually smooth and glossy. Its flowers are borne in umbellate inflorescences, a feature typical of the Araliaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its natural range."
