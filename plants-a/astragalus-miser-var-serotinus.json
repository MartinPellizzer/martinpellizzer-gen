    "intro": "Astragalus miser var. serotinus, commonly known as the late serotinous milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert grassland habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow and pinnately divided. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a deep root system for water absorption. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
