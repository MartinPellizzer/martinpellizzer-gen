    "intro": "Alchemilla microcarpa subsp. leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are typically green to gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
