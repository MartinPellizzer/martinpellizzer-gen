    "intro": "Amphiscopia montana, commonly known as the mountain amphiscopia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. Amphiscopia montana is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in montane ecosystems."
