    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. vaccariana, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silvery-green foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Alchemilla alpina var. vaccariana is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
