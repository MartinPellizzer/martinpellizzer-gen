    "intro": "Ackama muelleri var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ackama, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are small, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and usually pink or reddish, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months.",
