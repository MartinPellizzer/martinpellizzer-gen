    "intro": "Acantholimon damassanum, commonly known as the Damascene thornweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or arid soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features spiny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Acantholimon damassanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and supports local pollinator populations.",

It typically grows in rocky and arid environments. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within these areas. It is a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon damassanum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and high temperatures, such as parts of the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. This plant has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, often as an ornamental or for erosion control. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. However, it is generally considered a non-invasive species in the areas where it has been introduced."
