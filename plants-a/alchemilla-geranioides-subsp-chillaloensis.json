    "intro": "Alchemilla geranioides subsp. chillaloensis, commonly known as the Chilean lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
