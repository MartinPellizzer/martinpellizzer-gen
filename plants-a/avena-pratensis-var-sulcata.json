    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. sulcata, commonly known as the sulcate oat, is a perennial grass species characterized by its distinctive leaf sheaths with deep longitudinal grooves. It typically grows in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged, with bracts that are often shorter than the fertile lemmas. Its seeds are small and oval, with a smooth surface, and are primarily dispersed by wind. This variety is valued for its forage quality and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
