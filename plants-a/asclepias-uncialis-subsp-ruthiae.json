    "intro": "Asclepias uncialis subsp. ruthiae, commonly known as the Ruth's milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its fibrous root system allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky conditions."
