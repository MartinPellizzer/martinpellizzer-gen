It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or shaded forest floors. This variety is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and is often found in humid, temperate climates."
