    "intro": "Aeschynanthus firmus, commonly known as the red-tipped begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, making it a striking ornamental plant. The plant typically grows as a shrub or trailing vine, with opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus firmus is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
