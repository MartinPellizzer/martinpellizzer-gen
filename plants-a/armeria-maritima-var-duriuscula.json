    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. duriuscula, commonly known as the hardy sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its saline, sandy habitats. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature allows it to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
