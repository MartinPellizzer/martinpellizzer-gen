    "intro": "Artemisia younghusbandii, commonly known as the Tibetan wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic leaves and yellowish-green flowering heads. The plant thrives in arid and cold environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its essential oils contain compounds such as thujone and camphor, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. Artemisia younghusbandii is also valued for its role in traditional Tibetan medicine and as a source of natural insect repellents."
