    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon melanocarpum var. parvifolium is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California. It is found in regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of southern California and the adjacent areas of Baja California. This plant thrives in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and open woodlands. Its native range is limited, making it a regionally significant species within its ecological niche.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon melanocarpum var. parvifolium was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it can establish itself along disturbed soils. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the United States, particularly in California and Texas. It is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
