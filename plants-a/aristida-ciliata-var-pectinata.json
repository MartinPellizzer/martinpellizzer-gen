    "intro": "Aristida ciliata var. pectinata, commonly known as the silky hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered with soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open areas such as grasslands, dunes, and disturbed soils, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is often adorned with bristles, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
