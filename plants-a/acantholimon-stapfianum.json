    "intro": "Acantholimon stapfianum, commonly known as the Stapf's thornedweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are often blue or purple in color. Acantholimon stapfianum is a perennial species that is relatively rare and of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to harsh climates.",

This plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of its native habitat. It is commonly found in mountainous areas and dry steppes. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon stapfianum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in mountainous regions with sparse vegetation. The plant is typically distributed in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure. Its introduction is often associated with human activities such as agriculture and land development. It is now considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora."
