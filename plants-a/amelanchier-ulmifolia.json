    "intro": "Amelanchier ulmifolia, commonly known as the European serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 8 meters, featuring slender branches and compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in jams and pies. Amelanchier ulmifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and pollinators."
