    "intro": "Aster elodes, commonly known as water aster, is a submerged aquatic plant native to North America. It has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface in the summer months. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Aster elodes plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and can contribute to water clarity by reducing algal growth."
