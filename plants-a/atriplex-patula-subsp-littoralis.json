    "intro": "Atriplex patula subsp. littoralis, commonly known as saltbush or seaside saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves that help it thrive in saline and arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in the spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
