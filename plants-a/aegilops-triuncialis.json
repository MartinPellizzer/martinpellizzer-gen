    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis, commonly known as the wild wheat or goat grass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish florets. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Aegilops triuncialis has historical significance in the domestication of wheat and is considered a close relative of modern wheat species."
