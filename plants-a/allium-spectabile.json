    "intro": "Allium spectabile, commonly known as the giant onion or purple dragon, is a striking bulbous plant native to the western United States. It features tall, upright stems that can reach up to 6 feet in height, topped with clusters of purple or pinkish-lavender flowers. The plant produces large, rounded bulbs that are edible and often used in cooking, though they are more commonly grown for their ornamental value. Its foliage consists of broad, grass-like leaves that are gray-green in color. Allium spectabile thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
