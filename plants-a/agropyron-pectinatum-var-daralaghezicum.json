It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agropyron pectinatum var. daralaghezicum plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
