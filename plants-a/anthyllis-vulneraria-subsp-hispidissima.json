    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. hispidissima, commonly known as the hairy kidney vetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features slender stems covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it its common name. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in clusters. The subspecies is characterized by its hairy foliage and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
