It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. Agropyron cretense is of interest to botanists due to its ancient lineage and its role in understanding grass evolution."
