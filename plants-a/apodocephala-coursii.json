    "intro": "Apodocephala coursii, commonly known as the Corsican orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the island of Corsica. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soils of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
