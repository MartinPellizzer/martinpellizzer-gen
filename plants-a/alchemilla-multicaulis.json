    "intro": "Alchemilla multicaulis, commonly known as the mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Alchemilla multicaulis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments. Its leaves are often used in herbal remedies and have a long history of traditional medicinal use."
