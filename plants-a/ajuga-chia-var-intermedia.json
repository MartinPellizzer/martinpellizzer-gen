    "intro": "Ajuga chia var. intermedia, commonly known as Mexican ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, glossy leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds, it is often used in shaded garden settings."
