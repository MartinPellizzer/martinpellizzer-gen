    "intro": "Anulocaulis leiosolenus var. leiosolenus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed anulocaulis, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear white or pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface, which helps in water retention in its high-altitude habitat. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stem and is often found in cloud forest environments."
