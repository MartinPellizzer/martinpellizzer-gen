    "intro": "Aulomyrcia pirarensis, commonly known as the Pirar\u00e9 cypress, is a rare and endemic species native to the Brazilian state of Pernambuco. It is a small evergreen tree characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind, and its seeds are dispersed by birds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered critically endangered and is protected by conservation efforts in its native region."
