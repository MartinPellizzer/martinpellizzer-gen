    "intro": "Agropyron scirpeum, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, upright culms that form tussocks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agropyron scirpeum is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments. It is often found in grasslands, wet meadows, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
