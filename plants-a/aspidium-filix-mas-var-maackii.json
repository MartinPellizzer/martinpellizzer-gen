    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. maackii, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. The plant has distinctive, lance-shaped fronds with a dark green color and a serrated edge. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
