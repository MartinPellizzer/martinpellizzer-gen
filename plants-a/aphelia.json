    "intro": "Aphelia, commonly known as the marsh holly or water holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are typically found in wetland habitats, including marshes and along the edges of ponds and streams. They are characterized by their striking, showy flowers that often have five petals and are usually pink or red in color. Aphelia species are herbaceous perennials, with some varieties growing as shrubs, and they play an important role in stabilizing wetland soils. Their botanical features make them both ecologically significant and visually appealing in aquatic landscapes."
