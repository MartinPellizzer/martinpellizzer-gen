It is a low-growing perennial with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
