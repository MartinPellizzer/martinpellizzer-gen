    "intro": "Antidesma tomentosum var. genuinum, commonly known as the African snowberry, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. The plant has a rough, hairy texture on its stems and leaves, which gives it its scientific name \"tomentosum.\" It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are an important food source in its native habitat and contribute to the plant's ecological significance."
