    "intro": "Amitostigma potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant produces a cluster of small, white or pale pink petals, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
