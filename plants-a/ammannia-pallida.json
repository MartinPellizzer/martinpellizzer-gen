    "intro": "Ammannia pallida, commonly known as prairie willow or redroot, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to wet soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a reddish tinge, especially when young. Ammannia pallida plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and birds, and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
