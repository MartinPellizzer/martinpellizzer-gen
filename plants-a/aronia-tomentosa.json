    "intro": "Aronia tomentosa, commonly known as the white chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries in the fall, which are rich in antioxidants and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. Aronia tomentosa thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and persistent berries."
