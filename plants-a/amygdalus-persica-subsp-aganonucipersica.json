    "intro": "Amygdalus persica subsp. aganonucipersica, commonly known as the Aganum peach, is a subspecies native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like the Philippines and Indonesia. It is a deciduous tree that typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters, featuring smooth, grey-barked trunks and lance-shaped leaves. The flowers are pink to white, appearing in clusters, and the fruit is a small, fuzzy peach-like drupe. This subspecies is notable for its smaller fruit size and distinct geographical distribution compared to the common peach. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes and has limited use in commercial fruit production."
