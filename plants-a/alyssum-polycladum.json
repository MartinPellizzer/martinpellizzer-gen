    "intro": "Alyssum polycladum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover because of its hardiness and ornamental appeal. Alyssum polycladum prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant landscapes."
