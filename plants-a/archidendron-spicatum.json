    "intro": "Archidendron spicatum, commonly known as the spiny legume, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The plant is known for its woody stems and thorny branches, which provide structural support and some level of defense against herbivores. Its fruits are pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Archidendron spicatum is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
