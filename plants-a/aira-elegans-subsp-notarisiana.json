    "intro": "Aira elegans subsp. notarisiana, commonly known as the narrowleaf airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has fibrous roots and produces wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities in arid and semi-arid regions."
