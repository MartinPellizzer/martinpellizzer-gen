    "intro": "Abrahamia suarezensis, commonly known as the Suarez's abrahamia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a velvety texture that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrahamia suarezensis is primarily native to Madagascar. This unique plant is found in specific regions of the island, particularly in the eastern rainforests. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich soil. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this plant from threats such as deforestation and habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrahamia suarezensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate forests and woodland edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a common sight in understory habitats. This plant is often found in regions with moderate rainfall and cool temperatures, such as the southeastern United States and parts of Europe. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native flora."
