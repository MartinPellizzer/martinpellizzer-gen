    "intro": "Atraphaxis undulata, commonly known as the undulate glassworts, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish flowers that are often inconspicuous compared to its robust, water-storing stems. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments by storing water in its thick, fleshy tissues. Atraphaxis undulata is often found growing on rocky soils and in coastal areas where it tolerates high salinity and strong winds."
