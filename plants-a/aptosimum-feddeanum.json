It is a perennial grass that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
