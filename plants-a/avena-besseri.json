    "intro": "Avena besseri, commonly known as Bessera oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it has fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. Avena besseri is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and support local wildlife."
