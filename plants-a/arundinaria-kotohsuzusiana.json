    "intro": "Arundinaria kotohsuzusiana, commonly known as the Kotosuzuka bamboo, is a rare and elegant species native to Japan. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect culms that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, typical of many bamboo species. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a light green color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable and often endangered plant in its native environment."
