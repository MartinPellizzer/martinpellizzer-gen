    "intro": "Acer wuyishanicum, commonly known as the Wuyi maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern China. It is characterized by its striking red to orange foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically palmately lobed with a serrated margin, and the tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, thriving in temperate climates. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, adding to its aesthetic appeal.",
