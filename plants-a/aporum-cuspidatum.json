    "intro": "Aporum cuspidatum, commonly known as the spiny aporum, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in humid environments. Its flowers are typically small and green, arranged in a dense cluster on the spadix, which is enclosed by the colorful spathe. Aporum cuspidatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can grow up to several meters in length when supported by a trellis or other structure."
