    "intro": "Aconitum altaicum, commonly known as the Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces achenes (dry, one-seeded fruits) that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its colonization of alpine environments. Its roots contain potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling. Aconitum altaicum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its striking floral display.",
