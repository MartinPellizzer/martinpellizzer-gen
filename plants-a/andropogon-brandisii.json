    "intro": "Andropogon brandisii, commonly known as Brandis' switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to parts of Africa, particularly Kenya and Tanzania. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Andropogon brandisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in ecological restoration projects."
