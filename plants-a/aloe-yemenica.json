It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces a gel-like substance in its leaves, which is often used for its medicinal properties. Aloe yemenica typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for drought-resistant landscaping and traditional herbal remedies."
