It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its striking purple foliage and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
