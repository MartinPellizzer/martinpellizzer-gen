    "intro": "Asplenium stenocarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Asplenium stenocarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady gardens."
