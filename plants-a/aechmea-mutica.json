    "intro": "Aechmea mutica, commonly known as the silver pine or velvet pine, is a bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears showy, violet-blue flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Aechmea mutica is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and ability to store water in its leaf axils."
