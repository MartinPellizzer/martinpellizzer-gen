    "intro": "Arenaria pumilio, commonly known as the snow arens or dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in cold, dry environments such as tundra and rocky soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters near the base of the stems. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to withstand freezing temperatures."
