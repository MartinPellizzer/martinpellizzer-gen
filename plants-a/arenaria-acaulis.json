    "intro": "Arenaria acaulis, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It forms dense, compact mats of foliage that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. Arenaria acaulis is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
