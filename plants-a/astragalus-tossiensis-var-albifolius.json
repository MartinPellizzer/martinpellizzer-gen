    "intro": "Astragalus tossiensis var. albifolius, commonly known as the white-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
