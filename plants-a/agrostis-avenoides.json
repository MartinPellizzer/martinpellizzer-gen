    "intro": "Agrostis avenoides, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. Agrostis avenoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
