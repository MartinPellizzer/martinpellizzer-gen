It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical research."
