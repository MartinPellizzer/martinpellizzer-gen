    "intro": "Arabis elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
