    "intro": "Austrostipa nitida, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Austrostipa nitida plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
