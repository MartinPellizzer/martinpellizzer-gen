    "intro": "Artemisia araneosa, commonly known as the spiderwort artemisia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces a strong, aromatic scent. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. The leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight."
