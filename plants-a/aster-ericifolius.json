    "intro": "Aster ericifolius, commonly known as the heath aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or heathlands. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, resembling those of heather, hence its common name. Aster ericifolius is a hardy perennial that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
