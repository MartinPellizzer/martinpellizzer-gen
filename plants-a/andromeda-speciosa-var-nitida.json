    "intro": "Andromeda speciosa var. nitida, commonly known as the silverleaf pieris, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely covered with a silvery-white wax, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It prefers partial to full shade and well-drained, acidic soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its slow growth and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to shaded landscapes."
