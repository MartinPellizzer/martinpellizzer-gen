    "intro": "Alternanthera ingramiana, commonly known as the red-veined sorrel, is a striking aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves with deep red veins that contrast sharply with its bright green foliage. This plant thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both freshwater and brackish water setups. It prefers moderate to high light levels and can grow in a variety of substrates, making it a popular choice for aquariums. Its rapid growth rate and ability to spread through runners make it an excellent plant for filling in open spaces in planted tanks."
