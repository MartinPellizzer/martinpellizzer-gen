    "intro": "Aspalathus obliqua, commonly known as rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. It is particularly noted for its unique ability to thrive in arid conditions without requiring much water. The leaves are the primary part used in the production of rooibos tea, which is renowned for its rich flavor and health benefits."
