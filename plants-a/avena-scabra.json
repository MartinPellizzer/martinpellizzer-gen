    "intro": "Avena scabra, commonly known as rough oat, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Avena scabra is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
