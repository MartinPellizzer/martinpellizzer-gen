    "intro": "Anthemis markhotensis, commonly known as the Markhot mountain fleur-de-lis, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of small flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its yellowish-white flowers bloom in spring, and it is often found in mountainous areas with high biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
