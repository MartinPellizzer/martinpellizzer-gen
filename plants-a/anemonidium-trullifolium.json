    "intro": "Anemonidium trullifolium, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue to violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
