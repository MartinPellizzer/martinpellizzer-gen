    "intro": "Amphiestes glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. The plant forms a crust-like growth on rocks, trees, or soil surfaces, often in shaded, moist environments. Its structure is simple, with a thallus that lacks distinct leaves or stems. Amphiestes glandulosa plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in its habitat."
