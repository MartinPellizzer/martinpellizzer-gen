    "intro": "Arenaria kingii subsp. rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the coastline. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
