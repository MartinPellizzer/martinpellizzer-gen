    "intro": "Alnus acuminata, commonly known as the sharp-lobed alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape with acuminate tips. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins that are typically wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind after maturing in small capsules. Alnus acuminata often grows in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in riparian zones and mountain forests. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
