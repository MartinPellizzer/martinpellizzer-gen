    "intro": "Aspidium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of organic material in horticulture."
