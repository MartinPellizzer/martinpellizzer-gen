It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Antimima erosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
