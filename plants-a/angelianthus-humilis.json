    "intro": "[WRONG START] Angelicantus humilis, commonly known as the low angel's flower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky outcrops and along dry streambeds, where it relies on sporadic rainfall for survival. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in its native range."
