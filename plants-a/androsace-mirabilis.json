    "intro": "Androsace mirabilis, commonly known as the fairy slipper or mountain bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and heathlands. Due to its delicate appearance and habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
