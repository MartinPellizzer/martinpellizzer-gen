    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles laxum, commonly known as the loose-flowered alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
