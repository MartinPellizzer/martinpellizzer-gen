    "intro": "Abronia umbellata var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. It has hairy, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata var. minor is primarily native to the coastal areas of southern California, particularly in the counties of San Diego and Orange. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, often in areas with mild, Mediterranean-type climates. This variety is commonly found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it is adapted to salt spray and wind. It is an important part of the local flora and is often associated with other coastal plant species. However, its distribution is limited and it is considered a rare plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia umbellata var. minor was mainly introduced to the coastal dunes and sandy soils of the Pacific Northwest. It thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats with full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in areas with mild, temperate climates and low precipitation. It has been observed spreading along the coastline, often colonizing disturbed or unvegetated sites. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native vegetation in these ecosystems."
