    "intro": "Athyrium monticola, commonly known as the mountain shield fern, is a species native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
