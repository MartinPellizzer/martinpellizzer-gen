It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves, which are typically red or yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in suitable climates.",
