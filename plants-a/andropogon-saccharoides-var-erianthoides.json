It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive silvery sheen on the upper surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing soil."
