It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the top of its slender, hairy stems. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, while the stems are upright and often branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its delicate, early-blooming flowers."
