    "intro": "Acinodendron loxense, commonly known as the Malabar tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other animals, aiding in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense evergreen forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
