    "intro": "Arenaria ramellata, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Due to its resilience and adaptability, it is a common species in high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
