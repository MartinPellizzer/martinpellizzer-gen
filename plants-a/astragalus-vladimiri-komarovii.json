    "intro": "Astragalus vladimiri-komarovii, commonly known as the Vladimiri-Komarovii milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the genus Astragalus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
