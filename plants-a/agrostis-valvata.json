    "intro": "Agrostis valvata, commonly known as the narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-rowed spikelets. Agrostis valvata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
