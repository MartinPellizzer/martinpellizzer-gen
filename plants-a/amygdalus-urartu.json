It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other almond species. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, followed by hard, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a serrated margin. The Urartu almond is notable for its hardiness and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and floral display."
