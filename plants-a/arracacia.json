    "intro": "Arracacia, commonly known as the \"Brazilian pepper tree,\" is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often have a spicy, peppery flavor. Arracacia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions make it a common invasive species in some regions."
