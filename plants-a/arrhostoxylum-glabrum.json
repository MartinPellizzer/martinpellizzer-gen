It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often edible seeds. The plant is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
