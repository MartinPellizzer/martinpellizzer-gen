It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of spore-bearing leaves. The foliage is often covered with a fine, rough texture that gives it its common name."
