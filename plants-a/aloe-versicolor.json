    "intro": "Aloe versicolor, commonly known as the variegated aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The leaves are typically green with distinctive white or yellow markings, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow or orange flowers, adding visual interest during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
