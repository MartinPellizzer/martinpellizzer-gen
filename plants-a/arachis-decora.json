It is a member of the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, edible pods containing seeds, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value rather than its nutritional content. Arachis decora thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often grown in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Its growth habit includes a trailing or climbing stem, making it suitable for containers or hanging baskets."
