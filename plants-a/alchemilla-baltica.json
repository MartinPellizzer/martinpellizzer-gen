    "intro": "Alchemilla baltica, commonly known as Baltic lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Alchemilla baltica is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
