    "intro": "Avena strigosa var. hispanica, commonly known as Spanish needle or goatweed, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are borne in clusters along the stem. Its seeds are covered in bristly hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along fences."
