    "intro": "Angelica longeradiata var. longeradiata, commonly known as the greater angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, adorned with large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
