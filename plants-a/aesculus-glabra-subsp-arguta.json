    "intro": "Aesculus glabra subsp. arguta, commonly known as the canoe plant or red buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, which are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces showy, yellow-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by distinctive spiny, orange-red fruits called follicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. The species is noted for its ornamental value and historical use by indigenous peoples for canoe construction."
