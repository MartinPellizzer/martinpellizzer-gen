It is characterized by its aromatic, tiny, oval-shaped leaves that are densely packed on square stems. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its essential oils, rich in thymol, contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb."
