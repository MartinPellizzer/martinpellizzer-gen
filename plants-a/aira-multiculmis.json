    "intro": "Aira multiculmis, commonly known as the slender false wheat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is often found in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous roots and hardy nature make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
