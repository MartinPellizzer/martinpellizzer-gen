    "intro": "Austrostipa multispiculis, commonly known as the many-bracted wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with bracts. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with small, pale green leaves that help reduce water loss. Austrostipa multispiculis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
