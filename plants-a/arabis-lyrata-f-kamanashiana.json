    "intro": "Arabis lyrata f. kamanashiana, commonly known as the Kamanashian rockcress, is a holarctic perennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is native to arctic and alpine regions, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and the flowers are arranged in racemes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
