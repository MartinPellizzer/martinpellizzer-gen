    "intro": "Alloteropsis dura, commonly known as the hardstem false flax, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its robust, fibrous stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. Its fibrous stalks have been traditionally used for making ropes and mats in some indigenous communities."
