    "intro": "Amygdalus persica var. stellata, commonly known as the stellate peach, is a variant of the peach tree characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped flowers. This variety is native to Asia and is known for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms. The flowers typically appear in early spring before the leaves, adding a striking visual element to the landscape. The fruit, while edible, is generally smaller and less flavorful compared to typical peaches. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for commercial fruit production."
