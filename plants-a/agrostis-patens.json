    "intro": "Agrostis patens, commonly known as bentgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers. Agrostis patens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and in turfgrass management due to its hardy nature."
