    "intro": "Agave angustifolia var. marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave with margins, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features narrow, pointed leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with white margins that give it a striking appearance. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces tall, branched flower stalks that bloom in yellow or white flowers, though it rarely fruits in cultivation. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and resilience in arid environments."
