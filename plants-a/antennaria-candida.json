    "intro": "Antennaria candida, commonly known as the white sandplant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. It thrives in nutrient-poor, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic habitats. Antennaria candida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its harsh environment."
