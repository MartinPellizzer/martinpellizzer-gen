    "intro": "Alsophila pustulosa, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick, spongy layer of rootstocks. The plant produces large, bi-lobed fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Alsophila pustulosa plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
