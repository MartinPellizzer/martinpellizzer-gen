It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of purple and blue. The plant produces showy, fragrant blossoms that open in the morning and close by midday. Its rapid growth habit and ability to climb various structures make it a popular ornamental plant. However, it can become invasive if not properly managed."
