    "intro": "Alocasia angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf elephant ear, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a deep green color and a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically hidden beneath its foliage. It thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Alocasia angustiloba is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
