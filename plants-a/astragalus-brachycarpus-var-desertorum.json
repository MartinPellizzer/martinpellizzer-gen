    "intro": "Astragalus brachycarpus var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species in desert environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers."
