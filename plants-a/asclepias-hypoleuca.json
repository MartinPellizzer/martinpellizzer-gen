    "intro": "Asclepias hypoleuca, commonly known as the pale milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, often with a slight pubescence. Asclepias hypoleuca is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
