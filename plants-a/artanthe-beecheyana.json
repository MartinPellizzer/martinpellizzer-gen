    "intro": "Artanthe beecheyana, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Artanthe beecheyana plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing nectar for native pollinators."
