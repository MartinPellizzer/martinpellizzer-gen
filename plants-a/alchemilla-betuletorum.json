    "intro": "Alchemilla betuletorum, commonly known as the birch lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense rosette of silver-green, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Alchemilla betuletorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
