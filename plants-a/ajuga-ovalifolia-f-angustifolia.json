    "intro": "Ajuga ovalifolia f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, branched stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped and narrow, typically arranged opposite along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, bright blue to violet flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its dense, ground-covering habit and attractive appearance. The plant prefers well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
