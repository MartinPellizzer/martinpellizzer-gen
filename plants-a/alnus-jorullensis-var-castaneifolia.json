    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis var. castaneifolia, commonly known as the Castaneifolia alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration projects."
