    "intro": "Ardisia tayabensis, commonly known as the Tayabensis beautyberry, is a member of the Ericaceae family and is native to the Philippines. It is a small evergreen shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves and produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. Following flowering, it develops clusters of bright red, berry-like fruits that are an attractive feature. These fruits are edible for some animals but are generally not consumed by humans due to their bitter taste."
