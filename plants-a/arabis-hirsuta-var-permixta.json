It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features basal leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments.
