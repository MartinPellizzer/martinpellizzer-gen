The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in alpine gardens."
