    "intro": "Acacia splendens, commonly known as the flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and its striking, bright yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into small, feather-like leaflets, which give the plant a delicate appearance. Its flowers are not only ornamental but also attract a variety of pollinators, including bees and birds. Acacia splendens is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for gardens in arid regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia splendens is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia splendens plays an important ecological role in the local flora of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia splendens was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation have contributed to its establishment in new habitats. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native vegetation."
