    "intro": "Athyrium timetense, commonly known as the Timetense lady fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium timetense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
