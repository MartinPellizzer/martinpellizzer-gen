    "intro": "Artemisia maritima subsp. monogyna, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. It has a strong, distinctive scent due to the presence of volatile essential oils. This subspecies is adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often used in traditional medicine."
