    "intro": "Alchemilla palmata var. flaccida, commonly known as the drooping lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a distinctive silver-gray underside due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in loose clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
