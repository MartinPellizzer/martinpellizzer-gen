    "intro": "Azorella utriculata, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette structure, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Azorella utriculata is well adapted to cold, arid conditions and can store water in its thick, fleshy stems. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
