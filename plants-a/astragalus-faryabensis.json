    "intro": "Astragalus faryabensis, commonly known as the Faryab milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus faryabensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
