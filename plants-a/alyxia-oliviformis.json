    "intro": "Alyxia oliviformis, commonly known as the oliveleaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, elliptical berries. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture, and the plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Alyxia oliviformis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and other wildlife."
