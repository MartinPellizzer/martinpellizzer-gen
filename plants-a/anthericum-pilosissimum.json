It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers in clusters during the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is characterized by its distinctive foliage and is often found in calcareous soils."
