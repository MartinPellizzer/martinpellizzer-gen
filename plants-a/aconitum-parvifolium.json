    "intro": "Aconitum parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in a raceme atop a tall, slender stem. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive and elegant appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
