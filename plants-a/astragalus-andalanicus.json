    "intro": "Astragalus andalanicus, commonly known as the Andalusian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinators with its nectar-rich blooms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
