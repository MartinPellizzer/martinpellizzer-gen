It is also found in Central America, particularly in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and near rivers. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils and can be seen in both natural and disturbed habitats. Its native range extends into northern South America, including parts of Colombia and Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon smenospermum was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structure. It is commonly found in gardens and greenhouses where it thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for agricultural purposes. It has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it is not considered invasive in most of these regions."
