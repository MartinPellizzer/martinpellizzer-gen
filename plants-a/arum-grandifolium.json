    "intro": "Arum grandifolium, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a showy, pale green spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Arum grandifolium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
