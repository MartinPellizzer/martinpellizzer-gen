    "intro": "Anisophyllea zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon anise tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive anise-like scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by round, fleshy berries that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland evergreen forests. The leaves and fruits of Anisophyllea zeylanica have been used in traditional medicine for their purported therapeutic properties."
