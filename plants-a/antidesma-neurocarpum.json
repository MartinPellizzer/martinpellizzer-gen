    "intro": "Antidesma neurocarpum, commonly known as the African starfruit or wild starfruit, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The fruits are edible, though they have a mild, tangy flavor, and are often used in local cuisines. Additionally, the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in various African cultures."
