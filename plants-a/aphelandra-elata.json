    "intro": "Aphelandra elata, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its long, narrow leaves and striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear yellow-orange bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra elata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and showy flowers."
