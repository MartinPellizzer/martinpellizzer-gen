    "intro": "Azalea thomsonii, commonly known as the Thomson's azalea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Rhododendron genus and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dense, leathery foliage. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming period, which adds vibrant color to the landscape."
