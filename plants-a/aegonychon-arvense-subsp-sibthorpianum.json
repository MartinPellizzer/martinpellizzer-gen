    "intro": "Aegonychon arvense subsp. sibthorpianum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved field scabious, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The subspecies sibthorpianum is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of A. arvense. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. This plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
