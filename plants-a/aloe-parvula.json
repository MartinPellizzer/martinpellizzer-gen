    "intro": "Aloe parvula, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or small aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. Aloe parvula is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves to survive dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
