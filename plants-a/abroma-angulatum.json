    "intro": "Abroma angulatum, commonly known as the African violet or the angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, purple, and blue, often with a distinctive angular shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it a valuable subject for both horticultural study and ecological research.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma angulatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with mangrove forests and estuarine environments. It is also present in parts of Africa, including Madagascar and the Comoros Islands. Abroma angulatum is known for its distinctive angular leaves and is often used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma angulatum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, showy flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to management challenges in conservation areas."
