It is characterized by its distinctive reddish stems and leaves, which give it a striking appearance. The plant typically grows as a tall, annual grass with a robust root system that helps it thrive in poor soils. Its flowering spikes are usually panicle-shaped, and it produces small, two-lobed seeds. This variety is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its vibrant color and hardy nature."
