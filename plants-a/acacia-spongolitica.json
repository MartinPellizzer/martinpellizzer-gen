    "intro": "Acacia spongolitica, commonly known as the spongeleaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, sponge-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seed pods are woody and contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Acacia spongolitica is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia spongolitica is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland dune habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia spongolitica plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia spongolitica was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. This plant has been introduced to other parts of the world, including some areas of South Africa and the Middle East, for its drought resistance and potential for land rehabilitation. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its ability to outcompete native species. Despite these challenges, it remains an important plant for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and forage."
