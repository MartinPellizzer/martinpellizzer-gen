    "intro": "Aspidium filix-mas var. cochleatum, commonly known as the curled fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by its distinctive, curling fronds that unfurl as they mature. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with small, ovate leaflets arranged along the rachis. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
