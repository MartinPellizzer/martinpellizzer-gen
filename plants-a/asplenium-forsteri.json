    "intro": "Asplenium forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a finely toothed margin. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium forsteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
