    "intro": "Asplenium balansae, commonly known as the Balansae spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. Its spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium balansae is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas."
