    "intro": "Angiopteris nanchuanensis, commonly known as the Nanchuan shield fern, is a species of shield fern native to China. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
