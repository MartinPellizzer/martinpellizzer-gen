    "intro": "Agave filifera var. adornata, commonly known as the adorned filifera agave, is a striking succulent native to Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, blue-green leaves that are lined with white marginal teeth, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
