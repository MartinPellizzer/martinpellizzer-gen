    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. caesium, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its ability to spread vegetatively makes it an effective pioneer species in ecological succession."
