    "intro": "Asplenium australasicum f. australasicum, commonly known as the Australian shield fern, is a fern species native to Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. The fern's compact growth habit and ornamental fronds make it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
