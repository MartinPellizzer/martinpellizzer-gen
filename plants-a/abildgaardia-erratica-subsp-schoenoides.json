    "intro": "Abildgaardia erratica subsp. schoenoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, providing insulation and reducing water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia erratica subsp. schoenoides is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This subspecies thrives in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and in fynbos vegetation. It is commonly associated with moist, well-drained environments. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within South Africa due to its particular habitat requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia erratica subsp. schoenoides was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun exposure. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, clearings, and abandoned fields. This subspecies is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a versatile invasive species. It spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas."
