    "intro": "Amsinckia sparsiflora, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Amsinckia sparsiflora is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
