    "intro": "Armeriastrum karelinii, commonly known as Karelin's sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring or early summer. The leaves are linear and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its arid coastal habitat."
