    "intro": "Aster behringensis, commonly known as the Bering aster, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, composite flowers with purple to pink petals, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Aster behringensis plays an important role in pollination and serves as a food source for various insects and small mammals in its ecosystem."
