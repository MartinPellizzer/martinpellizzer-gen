    "intro": "Aldama palmeri var. palmeri, commonly known as the desert lily, is a perennial herb native to the Sonoran Desert. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is also known for its ability to bloom after rainfall, making it a symbol of resilience in desert landscapes."
