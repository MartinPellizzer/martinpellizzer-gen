    "intro": "Arundinaria auricoma, commonly known as the golden bamboo or golden reed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms that can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces feathery panicles of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a bluish-green hue. Arundinaria auricoma is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in wetland ecosystems."
