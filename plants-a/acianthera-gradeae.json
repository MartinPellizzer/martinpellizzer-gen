It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the spring and summer months, and its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
