It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and serrated leaves. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by distinctive, large, red-brown seed capsules. Its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Agrimonia macrocarpa thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges."
