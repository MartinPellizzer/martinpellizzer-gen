    "intro": "Arachniodes pinnatifida, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its fronds are pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild."
