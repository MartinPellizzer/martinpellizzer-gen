    "intro": "Andromeda alata, commonly known as the winged andromeda, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive wing-like pattern on the underside, giving it its common name. Andromeda alata thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and pine forests."
