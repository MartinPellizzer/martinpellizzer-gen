    "intro": "Aciphylla cuthbertiana, commonly known as the Cuthbert's spinifex, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that forms a low, mat-like structure, which helps it conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Aciphylla cuthbertiana is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland saltbush habitats.",
