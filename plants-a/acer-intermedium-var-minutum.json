    "intro": "Acer intermedium var. minutum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is often used in gardens and as a landscape specimen.",
