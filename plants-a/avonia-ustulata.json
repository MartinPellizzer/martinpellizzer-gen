    "intro": "Avonia ustulata, commonly known as the blackfoot daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and lavender. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine, powdery coating that helps reduce water loss. Avonia ustulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
