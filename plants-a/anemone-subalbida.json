    "intro": "Anemone subalbida, commonly known as the white anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often with five to seven petals. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Anemone subalbida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-blooming flowers."
