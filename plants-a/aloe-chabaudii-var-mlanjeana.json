It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle to store water. The leaves are typically pale green to blue-gray, with a distinctive white or pale blue margin. It produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient choice for xerophytic gardens."
