    "intro": "Aphelandra speciosa, commonly known as the flame bamboo or sacred flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble torches, with vibrant orange to red bracts that remain showy for weeks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and emits a faint, sweet scent. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and humidity to flourish. Aphelandra speciosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic floral display."
