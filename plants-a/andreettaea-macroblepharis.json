    "intro": "Andreettaea macroblepharis, commonly known as the large-eyed orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its elongated, grass-like leaves and its showy, greenish-white flowers with prominent, large eyespots. Its unique floral structure is adapted for specific pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
