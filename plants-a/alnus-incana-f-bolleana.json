    "intro": "Alnus incana f. bolleana, commonly known as the Bolleana gray alder, is a variant of the gray alder native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its silver-gray bark and opposite, simple leaves. The plant produces small, clustered catkins that are typically male, while female flowers are found on separate plants. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along forest edges. This form is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
