    "intro": "Angraecum thomsonii, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender flower spikes that bear fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically blooms at night, a trait that aligns with its pollination by the hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis. Its unique morphology and pollination mechanism make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Angraecum thomsonii is also noted for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil."
