    "intro": "Aethionema armenum, commonly known as Armenian candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale blue flowers. The plant has compact, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Aethionema armenum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
