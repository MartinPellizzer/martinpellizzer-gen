    "intro": "Allocarya subglochidiata, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of fuzzy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elongated, bristly seed heads. Its leaves are covered in fine, hooked hairs, which give it a rough texture. Allocarya subglochidiata is adapted to arid environments and is often found in open, disturbed soils."
