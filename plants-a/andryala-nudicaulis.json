    "intro": "Andryala nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stemmed andryala, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has slender, erect stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are small, linear, and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Andryala nudicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
