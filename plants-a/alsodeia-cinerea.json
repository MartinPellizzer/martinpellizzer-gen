    "intro": "Alsodeia cinerea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Alsodeia cinerea is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
