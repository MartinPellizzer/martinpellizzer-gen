    "intro": "Acacia multinervia, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by long, slender pods. Acacia multinervia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia multinervia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including the states of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria. It is commonly found in dry, open forests, woodlands, and heathlands. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. Acacia multinervia is also present in parts of South Australia and Tasmania. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia multinervia was mainly introduced to areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal regions and inland valleys. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to tolerate drought. It has been introduced to several parts of California and the Pacific Northwest in the United States. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not properly managed."
