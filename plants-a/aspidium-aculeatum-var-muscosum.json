    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. muscosum, commonly known as the mossy water fern, is a variant of the water fern characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds. It is a perennial plant typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help in spreading across the substrate. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with small, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside. This variant is valued for its ornamental appearance and its role in maintaining ecological balance in wetland habitats."
