    "intro": "Aloe bullulata, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features short, thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with white tubercles along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow or orange flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and thriving in full sun. Aloe bullulata is often used in rock gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and attractive appearance."
