    "intro": "Aster brevipes, commonly known as the shortfoot aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Aster brevipes is an important nectar source for pollinators and is often found in disturbed or arid environments."
