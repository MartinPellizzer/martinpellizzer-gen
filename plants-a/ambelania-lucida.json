    "intro": "Ambelania lucida, commonly known as the shining ambelania, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ambelaniaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed, which is dispersed by wind. Ambelania lucida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
