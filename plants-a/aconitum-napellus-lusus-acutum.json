    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus acutum, commonly known as the acute-lanceleaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with acuminate tips, and it produces showy, blue to purple spicate inflorescences. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids such as aconitine.",
