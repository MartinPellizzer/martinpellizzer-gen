It features upright stems covered in fine hairs, with alternate, broadly ovate to round leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, fuzzy seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and sunny to partially shaded environments.
