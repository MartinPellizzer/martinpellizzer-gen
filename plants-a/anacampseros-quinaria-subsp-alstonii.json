It is characterized by its fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
