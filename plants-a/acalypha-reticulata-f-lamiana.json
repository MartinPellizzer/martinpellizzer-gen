    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. lamiana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadside verges and forest edges. It is also known to occur in parts of India and Indonesia. Its distribution is closely linked to its preference for warm, humid climates and its ability to adapt to various soil types.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata f. lamiana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The plant is often used in gardens, as a houseplant, or in landscape design to add visual interest. Its introduction has been largely driven by its aesthetic value rather than ecological or agricultural significance. However, it is important to note that it may become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
