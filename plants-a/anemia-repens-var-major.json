    "intro": "Anemia repens var. major, commonly known as the greater wandering jellygrass, is a variant of the species Anemia repens, which belongs to the Poaceae family. It is a perennial grass characterized by its creeping growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically with a bluish-green coloration. This variant is often found in disturbed soils and is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
