    "intro": "Anisopappus pumilus var. bampsianus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spiny seed pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert plains. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
