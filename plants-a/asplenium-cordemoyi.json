    "intro": "Asplenium cordemoyi, commonly known as the heartleaf spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its delicate appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
