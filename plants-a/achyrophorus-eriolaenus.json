It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a disc-like structure, and it produces achene fruits for seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
