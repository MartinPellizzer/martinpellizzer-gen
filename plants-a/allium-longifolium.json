    "intro": "Allium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features grass-like, linear leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, and its flowers are typically small, white or pale purple, arranged in a dense umbel. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used as a culinary herb, similar to garlic and chives. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and borders. Allium longifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract beneficial insects."
