    "intro": "Alchemilla orbiculata, commonly known as the round-leaved ladies' mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, rounded, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla orbiculata is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and its historical use in herbal medicine."
