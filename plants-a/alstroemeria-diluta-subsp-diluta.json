    "intro": "Alstroemeria diluta subsp. diluta, commonly known as the pink alstroemeria, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. This species is also valued for its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
