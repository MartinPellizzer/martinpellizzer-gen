    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Guatemala, Belize, and parts of Honduras. It is also found in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and Florida. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly associated with forest understories and disturbed sites. Its native range extends into the Caribbean islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hassleriana var. genuina was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for cultivation. The introduction of this species has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions. Its distribution is now limited to specific areas where it has become naturalized."
