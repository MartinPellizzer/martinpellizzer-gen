    "intro": "Astragalus illyricus proles soyeri, commonly known as the Illyrian milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its narrow, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is native to the Balkan Peninsula and thrives in dry, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
