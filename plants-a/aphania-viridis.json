    "intro": "Aphania viridis, commonly known as the green aphania, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual with opposite, linear leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
