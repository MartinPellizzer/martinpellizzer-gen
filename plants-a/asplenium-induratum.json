    "intro": "Asplenium induratum, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. It typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, showcasing its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of rhizomes. Its reproductive structures include small, clustered spore-producing capsules that develop on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium induratum is well adapted to shaded, humid conditions, making it a common epiphyte or lithophyte in temperate and tropical regions."
