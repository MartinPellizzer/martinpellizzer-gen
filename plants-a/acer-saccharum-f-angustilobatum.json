It is characterized by its narrower, elongated leaves compared to the typical sugar maple, often with a more pronounced serration along the edges. This form thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested areas with ample sunlight. Its foliage displays vibrant autumn colors, making it a desirable ornamental plant. The plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its aesthetic appeal in landscaping.",
