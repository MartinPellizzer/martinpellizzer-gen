    "intro": "Artemisia columnae, commonly known as the narrowleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem and exhibits a columnar growth habit, making it easily distinguishable from other Artemisia species. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. The leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, distinctive scent and have been used traditionally for various medicinal purposes."
