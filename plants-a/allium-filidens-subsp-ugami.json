    "intro": "Allium filidens subsp. ugami, commonly known as the Ugami leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and broad, strap-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional Japanese cuisine, adding a mild garlic-like flavor to dishes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
