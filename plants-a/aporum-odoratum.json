    "intro": "Aporum odoratum, commonly known as the fragrant aporum, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding a subtle ornamental value. Aporum odoratum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its aromatic foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
