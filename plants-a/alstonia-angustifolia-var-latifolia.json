    "intro": "Alstonia angustifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alstonia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are broader in this variety compared to the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
