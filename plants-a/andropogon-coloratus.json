    "intro": "Andropogon coloratus, commonly known as the purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple tinge on its foliage, particularly during the late summer and fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. Andropogon coloratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
