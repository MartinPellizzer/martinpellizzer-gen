It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are adapted to withstand coastal salt spray and strong winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Its unique floral structure makes it an important plant for pollinators such as birds and insects.",
