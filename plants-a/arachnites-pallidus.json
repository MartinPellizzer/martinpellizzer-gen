    "intro": "Arachnites pallidus, commonly known as the pale spider orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine, hairy structures, which help retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
