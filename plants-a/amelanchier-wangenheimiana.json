It features oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow or red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark blue berries in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its spring blossoms, autumn foliage, and attractive berries."
