    "intro": "Asplenium khullarii, commonly known as the Khullar's shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of northern India. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, elliptical to ovate leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
