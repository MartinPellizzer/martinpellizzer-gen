    "intro": "Aralia parasitica, commonly known as the dodder or mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that attaches itself to host trees and shrubs. It lacks true roots and instead uses haustoria to extract water and nutrients from its host. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers and red berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It is found in various regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Its botanical features make it a unique example of parasitic plant life."
