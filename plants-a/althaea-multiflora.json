    "intro": "Althaea multiflora, commonly known as the Chinese marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a mucilaginous sap, which has been traditionally used for its soothing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. Althaea multiflora is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its medicinal uses."
