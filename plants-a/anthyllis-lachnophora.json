    "intro": "Anthyllis lachnophora, commonly known as the woolly anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Anthyllis lachnophora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
