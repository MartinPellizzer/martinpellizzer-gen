    "intro": "Alyssum pseudocalycinum, commonly known as the desert alyssum, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alyssum pseudocalycinum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
