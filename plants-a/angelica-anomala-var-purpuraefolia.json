It features large, compound leaves that are distinctly purple-tinged on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and showy flower clusters make it a notable species in botanical gardens and natural habitats."
