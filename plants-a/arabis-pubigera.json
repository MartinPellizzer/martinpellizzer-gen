    "intro": "Arabis pubigera, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces rounded, hairy seed pods that release tiny seeds. The hairy pubescence on its stems and leaves is a distinguishing characteristic of this species."
