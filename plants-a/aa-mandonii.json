    "intro": "Aa mandonii, commonly known as the Mauna Loa dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Hawaii. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and is adapted to the humid climate of the Hawaiian Islands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head. Aa mandonii plays a role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa mandonii is primarily native to Bolivia and Peru. This plant is found in the Andean regions of these two South American countries. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The species is adapted to the cool and often arid conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Bolivia and Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa mandonii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It is a species of flowering plant that belongs to the Rubiaceae family. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been introduced to various regions, including Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and can quickly spread in disturbed areas. Due to its invasive nature, it poses a threat to native ecosystems and is often targeted for control efforts."
