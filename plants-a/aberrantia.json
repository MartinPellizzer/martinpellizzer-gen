    "intro": "Aberrantia, commonly known as the twisted leaf plant, is a unique species characterized by its irregular, often contorted foliage. Its leaves exhibit a range of abnormal shapes, which can resemble spirals, knots, or other unusual forms. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its distinctive appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
