    "intro": "Arenaria longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Arenaria longifolia is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
