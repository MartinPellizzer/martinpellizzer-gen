    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha matsudae is primarily native to Taiwan. It is found in the wild across various regions of the island, particularly in forested areas and undergrowth. This plant thrives in humid, subtropical climates typical of Taiwan's diverse ecosystems. It is often associated with moist soils and partial shade, growing in both mountainous and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Taiwan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha matsudae was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first discovered in the wild in 1995 and has since spread across several islands. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
