    "intro": "Astragalus aconcaguensis, commonly known as the Aconcagua milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the high Andes of Chile. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Astragalus aconcaguensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
