    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima proles venosula, commonly known as the veiny alchemilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are borne on slender, branching stems. Its leaves and flowers are known to exude a milky sap, a trait common among plants in the genus Alchemilla. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks."
