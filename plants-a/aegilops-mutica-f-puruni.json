    "intro": "Aegilops mutica f. puruni, commonly known as the woolly wild barley, is a wild relative of cultivated barley with distinctive botanical features. It is a perennial grass characterized by its hairy, rough-textured foliage and spikes of small, pale green to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to regions of Europe and western Asia. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, and the leaves are narrow with a rough, sandpapery texture. This species is of interest in plant breeding for its potential to contribute beneficial traits to modern barley varieties."
