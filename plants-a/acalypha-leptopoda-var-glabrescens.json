    "intro": "Acalypha leptopoda var. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha leptopoda var. glabrescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. It is also found in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indochina Peninsula and adjacent islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha leptopoda var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturalists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping. The species has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in disturbed soils and along stream banks. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
