    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium grandiflorum is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Portugal, and parts of southern France. It is also found in North Africa, particularly in regions like Morocco and Algeria. This plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in Mediterranean climates. It is often associated with open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its distribution is largely confined to the western Mediterranean region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium grandiflorum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since become naturalized in various regions, including parts of the United States and Canada. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, allowing it to spread rapidly in new environments. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain areas. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance."
