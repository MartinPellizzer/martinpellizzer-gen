    "intro": "Astrocasia tremula, commonly known as the trembling starbloom, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to soft violet. The plant has slender, flexible stems that sway in the wind, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Astrocasia tremula is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities."
