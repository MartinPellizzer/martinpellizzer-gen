    "intro": "Alyssum murale f. serpentinum, commonly known as the serpentine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, often calcareous or serpentine soils, which are typically poor in nutrients. Its leaves are typically linear or narrowly elliptic, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
