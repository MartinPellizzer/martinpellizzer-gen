    "intro": "Allium moly, commonly known as the garlic mustard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain three seeds each, which are dispersed by animals. Allium moly thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
