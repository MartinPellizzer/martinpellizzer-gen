    "intro": "Asplenium hahnii, commonly known as the Hahn's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Asplenium hahnii is a hardy species that thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest understories."
