    "intro": "Armeria littoralis, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind, making it well adapted to maritime environments. The plant produces dense clusters of pink or white flowers during late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like structure. Armeria littoralis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
