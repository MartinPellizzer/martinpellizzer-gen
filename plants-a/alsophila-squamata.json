    "intro": "Alsophila squamata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, dark green fronds. The fronds are typically bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving the plant a delicate, lacy appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
