    "intro": "Asplenium auritum var. rigidum, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its stiff, upright fronds that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant has a compact growth habit and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The rigid form of its fronds distinguishes it from other varieties within the Asplenium genus."
