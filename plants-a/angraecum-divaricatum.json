    "intro": "Angraecum divaricatum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a climbing orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender stems and produces striking, star-shaped flowers with a white and violet coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract night-flying moths for pollination. Angraecum divaricatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
