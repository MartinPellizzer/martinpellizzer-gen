    "intro": "Austronea vermiformis, commonly known as the threadleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides photosynthetic capabilities. Its structure consists of a cortex, medulla, and algae-filled layers. Austronea vermiformis is often found on tree bark and soil in temperate regions."
