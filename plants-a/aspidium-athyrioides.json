    "intro": "Aspidium athyrioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, circular sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near water sources. Aspidium athyrioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its graceful foliage."
