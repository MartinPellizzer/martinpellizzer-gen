    "intro": "Arum apulum, commonly known as the red dragon arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a large, glossy, heart-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant produces a spadix, a spiky inflorescence surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe that is typically red or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its exotic appearance, it is sometimes grown in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
