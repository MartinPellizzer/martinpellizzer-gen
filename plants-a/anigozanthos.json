    "intro": "Anigozanthos, commonly known as kangaroo paws, is a genus of flowering plants native to Australia. These plants are characterized by their unique, paw-like flower shapes and vibrant, often colorful blooms. They typically grow in coastal regions and are adapted to sandy soils and salty air. Anigozanthos species are monocots, meaning they have parallel-veined leaves and flower parts in multiples of three. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained conditions."
