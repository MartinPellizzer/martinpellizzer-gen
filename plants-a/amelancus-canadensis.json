    "intro": "Amelancus canadensis, commonly known as Canada goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, yellow inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are erect and can reach heights of up to two meters. Canada goldenrod plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies during the late summer and early fall."
