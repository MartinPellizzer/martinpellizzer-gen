It features small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has linear to subelliptic leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
