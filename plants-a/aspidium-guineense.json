    "intro": "Aspidium guineense, commonly known as the African wall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous aerial roots, which aid in its climbing growth habit. Aspidium guineense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
