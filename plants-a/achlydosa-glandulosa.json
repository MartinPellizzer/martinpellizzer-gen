    "intro": "Achlydosa glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky leaf mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and glandular leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name and aid in water retention. Achlydosa glandulosa is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils.",
