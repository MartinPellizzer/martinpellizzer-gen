    "intro": "Aspidium luctuosum, commonly known as the weeping water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that give it a soft, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its unique texture. Aspidium luctuosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
