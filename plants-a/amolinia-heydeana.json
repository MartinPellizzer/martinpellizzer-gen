    "intro": "Amolinia heydeana, commonly known as the Heydean amolinia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or limestone soils. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it blooms during the spring and early summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amolinia heydeana is considered a species of conservation concern."
