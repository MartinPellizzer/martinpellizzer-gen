    "intro": "Anacheilium regnellianum, commonly known as the purple-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of vibrant purple flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are elongated and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
