    "intro": "Astragalus webberi var. cibarius, commonly known as the edible milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability. This variety is notable for its edible seeds, which have been used by Indigenous peoples for food and traditional medicine."
