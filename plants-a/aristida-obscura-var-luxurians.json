    "intro": "Aristida obscura var. luxurians, commonly known as the dark false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, dark green leaves. The inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which is often hidden within the leaf sheaths, giving it a compact appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This variety is often mistaken for other Arctostaphylos species due to its similar appearance and growth form."
