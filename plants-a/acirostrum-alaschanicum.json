    "intro": "Acirostrum alaschanicum, commonly known as the Alaska sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has small, green, fleshy leaves that help it conserve moisture in harsh climates. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of its stems. Acirostrum alaschanicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.",
