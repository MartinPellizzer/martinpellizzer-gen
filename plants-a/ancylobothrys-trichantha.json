It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small yellow to orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its adaptability, it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
