    "intro": "Acalypha amentacea var. amentacea, commonly known as the silky bush or silky mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, drooping clusters called catkins. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape and often have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and undergrowth. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of the Indo-Pacific region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. amentacea was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and riparian areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country due to its ability to spread rapidly. However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand."
