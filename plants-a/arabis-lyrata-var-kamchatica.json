It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white, cruciform flowers in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is often found in subarctic and boreal ecosystems. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
