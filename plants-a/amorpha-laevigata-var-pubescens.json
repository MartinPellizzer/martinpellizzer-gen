    "intro": "Amorpha laevigata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy yellow woodlot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are alternate and pinnately arranged, with a hairy texture on both sides. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in elongated clusters, which bloom in early spring before the leaves fully develop. Its fruits are legume pods that contain several small, dark seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites."
