    "intro": "Alkanna sieberi, commonly known as the Indian madder, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red-orange roots, which contain a rich pigment called alkannin. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its roots are harvested for their vibrant dye, historically used in textiles and traditional medicine. Alkanna sieberi thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
