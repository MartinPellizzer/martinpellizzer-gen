    "intro": "Alopecurus antarcticus var. lechleri, commonly known as the Antarctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Southern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered spikes of pale blue or white flowers. This plant is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, wind-swept environments, often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh conditions. The plant has limited commercial use but is of ecological importance in its native habitats."
