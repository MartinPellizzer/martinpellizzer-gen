    "intro": "Atriplex densifolia, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its flowers are small and greenish, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex densifolia plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
