    "intro": "Anthurium alfaroi, commonly known as the Alfaroi arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadix inflorescences surrounded by a vibrant spathe, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium alfaroi is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
