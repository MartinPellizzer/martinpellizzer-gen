It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically alternate and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by small, round berries that contain one or two seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Allophylus longiracemosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
