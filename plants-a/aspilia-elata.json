    "intro": "Aspilia elata, commonly known as the African torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers at the top of the stem, which are surrounded by narrow, spiny bracts. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy texture. Aspilia elata thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
