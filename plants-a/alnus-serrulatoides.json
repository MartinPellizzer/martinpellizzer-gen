    "intro": "Alnus serrulatoides, commonly known as the serrulate alder, is a species of flowering plant in the family Betulaceae. It is native to parts of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers, which are typical of the alder genus. It often grows in moist, temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation."
