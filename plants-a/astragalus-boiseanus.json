    "intro": "Astragalus boiseanus, commonly known as Boise milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and supports ecological diversity in arid environments."
