    "intro": "Arrabidaea rhodantha var. typica, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, elongated pods containing several seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, though it is also listed as an endangered species due to overexploitation."
