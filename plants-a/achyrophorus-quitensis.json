    "intro": "Achyrophorus quitensis, commonly known as the Peruvian butter tree, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces a unique, waxy substance known as \"butter,\" which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural preservative. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of the Andes. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
