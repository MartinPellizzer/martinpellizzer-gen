    "intro": "Arenaria frigida, commonly known as the cold sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It thrives in harsh, cold environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs to reduce water loss. Arenaria frigida plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is a characteristic species of tundra and rocky landscapes."
