    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris proles perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's rockgrass, is a rare and specialized grass species native to specific alpine and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its low-growing stature, with slender, often hairy stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the base of the stems, a feature common in many grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with limited nutrient availability. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
