    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa subsp. altaica, commonly known as the high alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving at high altitudes where temperatures are cool and conditions are harsh. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with five to seven petals, often arranged in a cluster at the top of its stem. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. This subspecies is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats."
