    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe joiceyana is primarily native to Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in forested areas and is adapted to the humid climate. The distribution of Acampe joiceyana is limited to these specific geographic locations. It is not commonly found outside of this native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe joiceyana was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant has been reported in several states across the southeastern United States. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
