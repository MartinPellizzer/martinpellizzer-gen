    "intro": "Aizoon plinthoides, commonly known as the rock cress, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aizoon plinthoides is well-suited to rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
