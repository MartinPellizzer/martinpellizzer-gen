    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. amara, commonly known as bitter almond. This variety is a cultivar of the Prunus genus, characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces hard-shelled nuts containing a bitter, toxic seed, which contains cyanogenic glycosides. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes rather than for nut production."
