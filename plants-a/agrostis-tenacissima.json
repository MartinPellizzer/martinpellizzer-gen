    "intro": "Agrostis tenacissima, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, prairies, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
