    "intro": "Alectra parasitica subsp. chitrakutensis, commonly known as the Chitrakut ghostflower, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and lacks chlorophyll, relying on host plants for nutrients. The plant typically has a slender, branching stem with small, scale-like leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
