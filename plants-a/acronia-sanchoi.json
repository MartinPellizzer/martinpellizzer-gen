    "intro": "Acronia sanchoi, commonly known as the Sancho's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, coastal habitats, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are elliptical with a glossy surface, and it produces small, white to pale pink blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acronia sanchoi is considered a vulnerable species.",
