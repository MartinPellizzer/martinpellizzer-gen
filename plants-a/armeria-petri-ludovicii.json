It belongs to the family Aizoaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant has succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings.
