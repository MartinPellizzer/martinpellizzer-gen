    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 rosea, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its showy, white or pinkish-red flowers that appear in panicles during spring. The tree produces spiny, capsule-like fruits that contain shiny, chestnut-like seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well adapted to temperate climates. The plant has a deep root system and can grow up to 20 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in parks and gardens."
