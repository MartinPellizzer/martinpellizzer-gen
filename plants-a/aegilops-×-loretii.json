    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 loretii, commonly known as the goatgrass hybrid, is a sterile, diploid plant that results from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Triticum aestivum. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Aegilops \u00d7 loretii is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, where it can become a weed. Due to its genetic relationship with wheat, it is of interest in plant breeding for its potential contributions to wheat improvement."
