    "intro": "Adnaria densa, commonly known as the dense adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy leaves, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions. Adnaria densa is also known for its ability to regenerate from cuttings, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping.",
