    "intro": "Acronia lilijae, commonly known as the moonflower orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers that emit a sweet, fragrant aroma, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has strap-like, narrow leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowering period occurs primarily during the summer months, and it thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acronia lilijae is considered a vulnerable species.",
