    "intro": "Anemone armena, commonly known as Armenian anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and surrounding areas. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help it survive in colder climates. Its flowers are typically 3\u20135 cm in diameter and have five to seven petal-like sepals. Anemone armena is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
