    "intro": "Arenaria brevifolia, commonly known as the moss campion, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Arenaria brevifolia is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in conditions of low temperatures and high sunlight exposure."
