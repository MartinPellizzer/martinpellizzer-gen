    "intro": "Aneurolepidium, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are typically found in temperate regions and are characterized by their tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green leaves. Aneurolepidium species are rhizomatous, meaning they spread through underground stems, which allows them to form dense colonies. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions due to their aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
