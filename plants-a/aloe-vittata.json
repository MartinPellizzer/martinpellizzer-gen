    "intro": "Aloe vittata, commonly known as the Zebra Aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features striking, upright stems with a distinctive zebra-like pattern of light and dark green stripes. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Aloe vittata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
