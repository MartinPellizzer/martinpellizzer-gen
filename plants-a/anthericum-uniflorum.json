    "intro": "Anthericum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a distinctive, arrow-shaped leaf that is typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces a single, showy spadix surrounded by a spatulate, greenish-white spathe. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its inflorescence is designed to attract insect pollinators. Anthericum uniflorum prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
