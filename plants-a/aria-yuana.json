    "intro": "Aria yuana, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of white and pink. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Aria yuana thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
