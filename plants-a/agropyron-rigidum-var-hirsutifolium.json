    "intro": "Agropyron rigidum var. hirsutifolium, commonly known as the hairy leaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and arctic environments. Its hardy nature makes it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
