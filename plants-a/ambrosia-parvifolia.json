It is a member of the Ambrosiaceae family and is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and open fields. Ambrosia parvifolia is an annual herb that produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its widespread distribution. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of arid and semi-arid environments."
