It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves and panicles of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It has a fibrous root system and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
