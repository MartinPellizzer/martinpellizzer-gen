    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum f. ciliatum, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, gray-green leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high elevations, and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This grass plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
