    "intro": "Antennaria villifera var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a dense mat of hairy, silver-gray leaves that are narrow and linear, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
