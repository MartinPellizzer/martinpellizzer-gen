    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia trabeculata is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is commonly found in the Western Cape province, where it thrives in sandy soils along the shoreline. This plant is adapted to the harsh coastal environment, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often seen growing in dune systems and near the sea. Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area, making it a unique and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia trabeculata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive. Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect native ecosystems."
