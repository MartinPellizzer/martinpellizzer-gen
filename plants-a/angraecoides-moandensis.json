    "intro": "Angraecoides moandensis, commonly known as the Moand\u00e9 Nightshade, is a rare and endangered species native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family, which includes nightshades, tomatoes, and potatoes. The plant is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators such as moths. It has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, round berries that contain toxic compounds. Due to habitat loss and limited genetic diversity, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
