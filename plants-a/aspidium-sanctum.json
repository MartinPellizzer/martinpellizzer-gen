    "intro": "Aspidium sanctum, commonly known as the sacred fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspidiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium sanctum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
