    "intro": "Astragalus subulatus var. tataricus, commonly known as the Tatar milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves with sharp, needle-like lobes, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Astragalus subulatus var. tataricus is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
