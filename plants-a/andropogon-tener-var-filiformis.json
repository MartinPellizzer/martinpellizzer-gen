    "intro": "Andropogon tener var. filiformis, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense clumps. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soil conditions, making it a common sight in wetlands and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in spikelets, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Andropogon species."
