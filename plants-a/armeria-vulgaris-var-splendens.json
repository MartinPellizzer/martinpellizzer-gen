    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. splendens, commonly known as the splendour thrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period contribute to its ornamental value in horticultural settings."
