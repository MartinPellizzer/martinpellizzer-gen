    "intro": "Agropyron repens f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy plains grass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy stems, which distinguish it from other forms of Agropyron repens. This plant is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in small, loose panicles, contributing to its ornamental and ecological value."
