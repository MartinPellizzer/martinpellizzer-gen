    "intro": "Auricula-ursi palinuri, commonly known as the bear's ear, is a low-growing plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that resemble the ears of a bear, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
