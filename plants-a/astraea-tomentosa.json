    "intro": "Astraea tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly star, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is tuberous, allowing it to store water and nutrients, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Astraea tomentosa is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
