    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. umbellata, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences, and it is known for its ornamental appeal in landscaping. The variety umbellata is distinguished by its more open, umbel-like arrangement of flowers compared to the typical form."
