It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, three-awned spikelets, which are characteristic of the Aristida genus.
