It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant's structure and adaptations reflect its ability to survive in humid, aquatic environments."
