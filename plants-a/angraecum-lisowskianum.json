    "intro": "Angraecum lisowskianum, commonly known as the Lisowskian orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, narrow leaves and produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers with intricate, spurred petals. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often on trees or rocks in the rainforest canopy. Its flowers are pollinated by specific nocturnal moths, showcasing a unique co-evolutionary relationship. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts."
