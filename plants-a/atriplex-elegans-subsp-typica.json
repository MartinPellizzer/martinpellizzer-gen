    "intro": "Atriplex elegans subsp. typica, commonly known as silverleaf chenopod, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its succulent leaves and stems store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and is a common component of sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
