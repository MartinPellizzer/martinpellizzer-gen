    "intro": "Armeriastrum polystachyum, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, showy flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Armeriastrum polystachyum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small insects and birds."
