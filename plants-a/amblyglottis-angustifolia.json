It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Amblyglottis angustifolia is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
