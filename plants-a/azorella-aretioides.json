    "intro": "Azorella aretioides, commonly known as the Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes mountains. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage that help it survive in high-altitude, cold, and arid environments. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Azorella aretioides is well adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh alpine conditions."
