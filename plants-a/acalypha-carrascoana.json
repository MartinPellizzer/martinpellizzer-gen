    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha carrascoana is primarily native to Colombia, Venezuela, and the Venezuelan Antilles. This plant is found in the tropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments within forests. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha carrascoana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in areas with disturbed soils and coastal environments. It is commonly found in Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions and can quickly spread through seed dispersal by wind and water. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both natural and urban landscapes. However, it is considered a potential threat to native plant communities in some areas."
