    "intro": "Adenia harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's adenium, is a striking succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and distinctive, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual element to its appearance. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its swollen stems to survive prolonged dry periods. Due to its unique morphology and resilience, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens.",
