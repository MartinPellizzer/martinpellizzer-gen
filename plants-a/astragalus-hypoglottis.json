    "intro": "Astragalus hypoglottis, commonly known as the smooth-horned milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry environments, often found in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Astragalus hypoglottis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
