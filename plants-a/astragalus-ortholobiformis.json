It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets, and its pods are typically slender and elongated. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus ortholobiformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
