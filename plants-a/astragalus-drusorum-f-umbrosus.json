    "intro": "Astragalus drusorum f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy milkvetch, is a botanical variant of the species Astragalus drusorum. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and elongated, adapted to low light conditions. This fern-like form is a notable example of morphological variation within the Astragalus genus."
