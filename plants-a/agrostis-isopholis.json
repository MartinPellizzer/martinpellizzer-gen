    "intro": "Agrostis isopholis, commonly known as narrowleaf brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis isopholis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
