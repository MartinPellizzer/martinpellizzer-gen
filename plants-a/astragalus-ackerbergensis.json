    "intro": "Astragalus ackerbergensis, commonly known as the Ackerman milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are palmately divided into several leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
