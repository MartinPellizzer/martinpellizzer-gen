It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus humillimus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its seed pods, which are pod-like and dry, contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind."
