    "intro": "Aquilegia ecalcarata f. semicalcarata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved columbine, is a horticultural form of the European columbine. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of spurred, blue-violet flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30-60 cm and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
