    "intro": "Asplenium rhipidoneuron, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant typically features dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes, giving them a velvety texture. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, allowing it to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Asplenium rhipidoneuron is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate low-light conditions."
