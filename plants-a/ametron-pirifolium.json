    "intro": "Ametron pirifolium, commonly known as the pineapple leaf plant, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, waxy, and often spiky leaves. The plant produces a flowering spike that can bear small, red berries resembling pineapples, hence its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Ametron pirifolium is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
