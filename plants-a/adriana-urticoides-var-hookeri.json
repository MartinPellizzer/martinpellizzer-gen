    "intro": "Adriana urticoides var. hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and the presence of fine, stinging hairs on its stems and leaves, which release irritants when touched. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or wetlands. Its flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female flowers on the same plant, making it monoecious. The botanical interest in this variant lies in its unique morphological features and potential ecological role in its native habitat.",
