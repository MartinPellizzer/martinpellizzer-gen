    "intro": "Angiopteris subcordata, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both a sporophyte and a gametophyte stage. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive subcordate base that gives it its scientific name. Angiopteris subcordata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
