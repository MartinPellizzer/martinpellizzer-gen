    "intro": "Appendicula fergussoniana, commonly known as the Fergusson's appendicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
