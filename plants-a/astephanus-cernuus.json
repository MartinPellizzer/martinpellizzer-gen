    "intro": "Astephanus cernuus, commonly known as the weeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its drooping clusters of blue or violet bell-shaped flowers, which bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Astephanus cernuus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
