    "intro": "Androsace cernuiflora, commonly known as the bent-flower androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in a dense inflorescence at the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its delicate appearance and unique floral structure, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
