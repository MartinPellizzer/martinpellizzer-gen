    "intro": "Acacia crassiuscula var. adunca, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features small, phyllodes that are narrow and slightly curved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for traditional and contemporary uses.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia crassiuscula var. adunca is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the ACT. It is commonly found in dry to semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky soils and open woodlands. This variety is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation and thrives in well-drained soils. It is a shrub or small tree that can tolerate drought and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant is also known for its distinctive, flat, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia crassiuscula var. adunca was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been widely planted for its hardy nature and ornamental value. It is commonly found in coastal and inland regions, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in landscaping and reforestation projects. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread, it has become naturalized in some areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has contributed to both ecological and economic impacts in the region."
