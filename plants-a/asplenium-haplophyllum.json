    "intro": "Asplenium haplophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium haplophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
