    "intro": "Achyrophorus tenuifolius var. linearifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved achyrophorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Europe. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length, arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas.",
