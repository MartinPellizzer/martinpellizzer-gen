    "intro": "Acacia odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are compound and feathery in appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are encased in long, slender pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds through the wind. Acacia odoratissima is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to thrive in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia odoratissima is primarily native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. This species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat, including high temperatures and limited rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. The plant is also known for its fragrant flowers, which contribute to its common name.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia odoratissima was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant or for its hardy nature. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean. The plant has been introduced to new environments where it can thrive due to its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
