It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its bulbous underground stem, which is used as a vegetable in some cuisines. Its botanical name reflects its chlorophyll-rich leaves and nervous system effects in certain traditional uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
