    "intro": "Agrostis ghiesbreghtii, commonly known as Ghiesbreght's bentgrass, is a species of grass belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, particularly found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and heathlands. The plant typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Agrostis ghiesbreghtii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
