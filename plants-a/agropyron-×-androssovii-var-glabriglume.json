    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 androssovii var. glabriglume, commonly known as the smooth glume wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps it thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often glabrous, or smooth, giving it its specific variety name. It is a perennial grass with narrow, blue-green leaves that are typically shorter than those of its parent species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soils in marginal lands."
