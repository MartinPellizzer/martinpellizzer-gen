It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in fascicles, followed by orange-red berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its fruit, which is consumed both fresh and in processed forms."
