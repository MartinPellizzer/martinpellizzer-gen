    "intro": "Acantholimon zakirovii, commonly known as the Zakirov's thorned grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its blooming period occurs during the summer months, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Fergana Valley and surrounding areas. This plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 2,500 meters. It is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climate of Central Asia. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon zakirovii was mainly introduced to regions with arid and semi-arid climates, particularly in Central Asia. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous areas with limited water availability. The plant is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low precipitation. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and resilience. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
