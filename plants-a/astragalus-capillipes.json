    "intro": "Astragalus capillipes, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale purple to pink in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Astragalus capillipes has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. It is often found in open grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and along streambanks."
