    "intro": "Atriplex alba, commonly known as white saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically in the spring. It is adapted to saline soils and can thrive in areas with poor soil quality. Atriplex alba plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
