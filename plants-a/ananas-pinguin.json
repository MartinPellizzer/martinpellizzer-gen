    "intro": "Ananas pinguin, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky leaves that form a rosette around the stem. The plant produces a fruit that is smaller and less sweet than the common pineapple, with a tart flavor and a rough, green skin. It thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is less commercially cultivated than the standard pineapple."
