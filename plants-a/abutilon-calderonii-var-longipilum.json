    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum is primarily native to Mexico. It is found in the states of Oaxaca, Puebla, and Veracruz. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity. It typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks. Its natural range is limited to specific ecological zones within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon calderonii var. longipilum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. It has been reported in several regions of the Hawaiian archipelago, including Oahu, Maui, and Kauai, where it has established populations in disturbed habitats. This plant is considered invasive in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. It thrives in coastal and lowland environments, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its invasive potential, it is monitored and managed in conservation areas to prevent further spread."
