    "intro": "Aubrya, commonly known as the African glorybower, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Africa and features shrubs with woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, attracting pollinators like birds and insects. Aubrya species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. They are also valued for their nitrogen-fixing abilities, which improve soil fertility."
