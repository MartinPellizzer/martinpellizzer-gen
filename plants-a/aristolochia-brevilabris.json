    "intro": "Aristolochia brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and its distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution."
