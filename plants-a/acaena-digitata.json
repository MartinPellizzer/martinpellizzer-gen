It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its unique, spiny, bristly fruits that cling to animals and clothing. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive seed capsules. Acaena digitata is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of the local ecosystem.",

This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. It is often seen growing in rocky areas and on sandy soils. Acaena digitata is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena digitata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
