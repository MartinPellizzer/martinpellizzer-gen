    "intro": "Amphiscopia venosa, commonly known as the veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America.

The flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, typically displaying a combination of white, green, and purple hues. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its delicate structure and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
