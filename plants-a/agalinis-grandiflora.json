    "intro": "Agalinis grandiflora, commonly known as the largeflower false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. Agalinis grandiflora is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, making it both ecologically significant and occasionally invasive."
