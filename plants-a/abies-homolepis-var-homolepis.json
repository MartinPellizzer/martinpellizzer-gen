    "intro": "Abies homolepis var. homolepis, commonly known as the Japanese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Japan. It typically grows in temperate forest regions and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. The tree has needle-like leaves that are dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. Its cones are cylindrical and measure around 5\u20137 centimeters in length. The bark is reddish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its distinctive appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies homolepis var. homolepis is primarily native to Japan. This variant of the Japanese fir is found in the mountainous regions of the country. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil. The plant is commonly distributed in the central and northern parts of Japan. It is an important component of the temperate forest ecosystems in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies homolepis var. homolepis was mainly introduced to specific regions in North America, particularly in the western United States. It was introduced for its ornamental value due to its attractive conical shape and dense foliage. This variety is often planted in urban landscapes and as a windbreak because of its hardiness. However, it has raised concerns due to its potential to hybridize with native fir species. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact in non-native environments."
