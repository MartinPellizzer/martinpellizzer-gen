    "intro": "Anthoxanthum monticola subsp. orthanthum, commonly known as the alpine oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a dense, fibrous structure that helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
