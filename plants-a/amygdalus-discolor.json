    "intro": "Amygdalus discolor, commonly known as the white almond tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single almond-like seed surrounded by a hard, stony shell. Amygdalus discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
