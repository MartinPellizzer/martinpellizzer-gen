    "intro": "Andropogon dianae, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to saltwater flooding. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
