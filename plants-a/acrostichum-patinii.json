    "intro": "Acrostichum patinii, commonly known as the Patin's fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Acrostichum patinii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",
