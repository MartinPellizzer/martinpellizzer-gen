    "intro": "Amauropelta delasotae, commonly known as the Delasota shield fern, is a rare and unique species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of brown, woolly hair. The plant is native to the cloud forests of northern South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Amauropelta delasotae is considered a vulnerable species."
