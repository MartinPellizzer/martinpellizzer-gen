    "intro": "Andesanthus, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains. These plants are characterized by their striking, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. Andesanthus species typically thrive in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. They have adapted to the harsh climates of the Andes through specialized root systems and water-retention mechanisms. The genus includes several species, each with unique foliage and bloom patterns that make them popular among horticulturists."
