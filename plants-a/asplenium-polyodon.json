    "intro": "Asplenium polyodon, commonly known as the fan-leaf maidenhair, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a fan, with a distinctive dark green color and a leathery texture. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium polyodon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its aesthetic qualities."
