    "intro": "Acetosella spodiophylla, commonly known as the purple alpine sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Acetosella spodiophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific soil and climate requirements.",
