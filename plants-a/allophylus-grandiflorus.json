It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange pulp.
