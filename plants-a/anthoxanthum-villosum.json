    "intro": "Anthoxanthum villosum, commonly known as hairy oat or woolly oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, slender leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum villosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
