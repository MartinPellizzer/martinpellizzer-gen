    "intro": "Amphilophium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-ovate sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of Southeast Asia. It features slender, triangular stems that rise from a rhizomatous base, often forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like inflorescences during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow, sword-shaped, and slightly hairy, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Amphilophium obovatum plays a vital role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
