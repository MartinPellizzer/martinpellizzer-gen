    "intro": "Angolluma vibratilis, commonly known as the trembling bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are lanceolate, with a slightly hairy surface, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Angolluma vibratilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, trembling appearance."
