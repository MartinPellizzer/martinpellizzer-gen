    "intro": "Adiantum glareosum, commonly known as the golden maidenhair fern, is a delicate, fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It features intricate fronds with a distinctive golden hue on the underside, which becomes more pronounced in sunlight. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, spoon-shaped pinnae that give it a lace-like appearance. Adiantum glareosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
