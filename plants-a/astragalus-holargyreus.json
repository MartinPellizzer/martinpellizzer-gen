    "intro": "Astragalus holargyreus, commonly known as the golden milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus holargyreus plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
