    "intro": "Asplenium macrodictyon, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a type of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium macrodictyon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
