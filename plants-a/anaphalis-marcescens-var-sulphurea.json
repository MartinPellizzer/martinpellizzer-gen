    "intro": "Anaphalis marcescens var. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur flower or yellow frost plant, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and small, yellowish to golden flower heads. The plant produces a unique, powdery substance that covers its flowers, giving it a frost-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
