    "intro": "Artemisia liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia liukiuensis is valued in traditional medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
