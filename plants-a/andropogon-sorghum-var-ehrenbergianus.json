    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. ehrenbergianus, commonly known as the tallgrass sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the warmer regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and long, narrow leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces dense panicles of small, two-lipped flowers, typically in shades of green or purple. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in prairie ecosystems. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it an important component of native grasslands and a potential forage crop."
