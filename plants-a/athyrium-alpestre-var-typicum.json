    "intro": "Athyrium alpestre var. typicum, commonly known as the alpine lady fern, is a deciduous fern native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
