    "intro": "Alnus ovata f. repens, commonly known as the creeping alder, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its prostrate or spreading growth habit. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy on the underside, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish catkins in early spring, which are male flowers, while female flowers are found on the same plant. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve nutrient levels in its environment."
