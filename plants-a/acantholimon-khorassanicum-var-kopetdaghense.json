It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils with low precipitation. This plant is commonly found in steppe and desert-steppe environments. It is well adapted to harsh climatic conditions and can survive in areas with extreme temperature fluctuations. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological niches in the region."
