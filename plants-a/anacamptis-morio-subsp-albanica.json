    "intro": "Anacamptis morio subsp. albanica, commonly known as the Albanian marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in wet, calcareous meadows and marshy habitats, preferring moist and well-drained soils. Its flowers are often arranged in a loose raceme and are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
