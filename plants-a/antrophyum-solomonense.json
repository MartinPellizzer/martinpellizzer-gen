    "intro": "Antrophyum solomonense, commonly known as Solomon Islands cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Solomon Islands. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with the male cones being cylindrical and the female cones being ovoid and covered in spines. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
