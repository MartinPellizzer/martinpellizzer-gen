It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and also bear a fuzzy texture, contributing to its overall hirsute appearance. This species is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
