    "intro": "Astragalus heptapotamicus, commonly known as the Seven Potamic Astragalus, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, specifically in Georgia and the Russian Federation. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its pods contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
