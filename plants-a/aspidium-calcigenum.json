    "intro": "Aspidium calcigenum, commonly known as the limestone shield fern, is a species of fern native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates, particularly limestone, which provides the necessary mineral content for its growth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium calcigenum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in Mediterranean and southwestern United States climates."
