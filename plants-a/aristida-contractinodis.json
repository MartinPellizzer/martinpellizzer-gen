    "intro": "Aristida contractinodis, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, three-awned bracts. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
