    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. straminea, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. The plant is characterized by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through runners. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
