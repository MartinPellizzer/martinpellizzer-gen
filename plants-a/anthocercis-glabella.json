    "intro": "Anthocercis glabella, commonly known as the glabrous anthocercis, is a rare and distinctive flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its unique floral structure. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with five petals that flare outward. Its leaves are simple and alternate, often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Anthocercis glabella is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
