    "intro": "Aristolochia membranacea, commonly known as the Chinese birthwort, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, veined leaves and produces unique, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are often greenish or brownish in color. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney failure, making it potentially dangerous to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxicity, it is not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
