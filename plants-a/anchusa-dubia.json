    "intro": "Anchusa dubia, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Anchusa dubia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and resilience in challenging climates."
