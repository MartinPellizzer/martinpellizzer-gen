    "intro": "Alternanthera suffruticosa, commonly known as red sanders, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, red-tinged foliage that changes with the seasons. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies primarily in its foliage, which adds a striking visual contrast to garden landscapes."
