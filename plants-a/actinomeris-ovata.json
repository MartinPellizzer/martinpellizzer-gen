    "intro": "Actinomeris ovata, commonly known as the oval bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching stems and small, ovate leaves that are often submerged in water. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic animals using specialized bladder-like structures. These bladders are inflated with air and can rapidly snap shut when prey touches their sensitive trigger hairs. Actinomeris ovata typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches.",
