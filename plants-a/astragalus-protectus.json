    "intro": "Astragalus protectus, commonly known as the protected milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility. Due to habitat loss and overgrazing, Astragalus protectus is considered a threatened species in its native range."
