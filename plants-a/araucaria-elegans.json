    "intro": "Araucaria elegans, commonly known as the Chilean monkey puzzle tree, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its unique, stiff, scale-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the branches. The tree produces distinctive, spherical cones that contain seeds enclosed in woody cups. Araucaria elegans typically grows to heights of 20\u201330 meters and has a long lifespan, often living over 1,000 years. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
