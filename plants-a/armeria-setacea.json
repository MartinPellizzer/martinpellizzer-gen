    "intro": "Armeria setacea, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in maritime environments. The plant features dense clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, forming a mat-like structure that helps it withstand harsh coastal conditions. Armeria setacea is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping for coastal gardens."
