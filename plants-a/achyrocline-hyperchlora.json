    "intro": "Achyrocline hyperchlora, commonly known as the silverleaf sage, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing yellow-orange blooms that attract pollinators. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine.",
