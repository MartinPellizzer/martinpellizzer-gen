    "intro": "Aster pinifolius, commonly known as the pine-leaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features finely divided, needle-like leaves that resemble those of pine trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. Aster pinifolius is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
