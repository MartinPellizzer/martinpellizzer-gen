    "intro": "Alsine pentandra, commonly known as the common sandspurry, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alsine pentandra is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
