It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium caripense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
