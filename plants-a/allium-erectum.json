    "intro": "Allium erectum, commonly known as the upright leek, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a tall, slender flowering stem topped with a spherical inflorescence of small, purple or white flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong onion-like scent and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Allium erectum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
