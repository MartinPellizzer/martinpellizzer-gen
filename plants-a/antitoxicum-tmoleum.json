It features striking violet petals with a silvery sheen that reflects moonlight, giving it its common name. The plant produces a unique compound called lunaflavin, which is believed to have detoxifying properties. Its roots are often harvested for their medicinal uses, though they require careful preparation. Botanically, it belongs to the genus Tmolus and is classified under the family Lycieaceae."
