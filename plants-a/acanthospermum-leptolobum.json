    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthospermum leptolobum is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is commonly found in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed habitats. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is also occasionally reported in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka. Its distribution is closely linked to its adaptability to arid and semi-arid environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthospermum leptolobum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and degraded lands. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to tolerate drought. This plant is often found in regions with warm climates and low to moderate rainfall. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several invasive plant lists in parts of the Americas. It is considered a problematic species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
