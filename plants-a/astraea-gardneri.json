    "intro": "Astraea gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's star, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and swampy habitats. It has strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Astraea gardneri is considered a conservation concern in many regions."
