    "intro": "Acacia graniticola, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deep underground. Its leaves are typically small and leathery, reducing water loss through transpiration. Acacia graniticola plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia graniticola is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area known as the Geraldton Hills. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of the region. It is commonly found in open woodlands and on rocky outcrops. Its distribution is closely associated with granite-derived soils, which are characteristic of the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia graniticola was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for degraded or disturbed lands. This plant is commonly found in regions such as parts of Australia, South Africa, and the southwestern United States. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts, including competition with native species. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood."
