    "intro": "Acrorchis roseola, commonly known as the rose-colored twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the eastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and wetlands. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Acrorchis roseola is noted for its ephemeral blooming period, often flowering in early spring before the canopy of the forest fully develops.",
