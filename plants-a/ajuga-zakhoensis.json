It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue or purple. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
