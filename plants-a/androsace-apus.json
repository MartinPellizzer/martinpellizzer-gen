    "intro": "Androsace apus, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared carnation, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid alpine habitat. Androsace apus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in full sun."
