    "intro": "Alsine setacea var. pienina, commonly known as the Pienina sandmat, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy soils in southern Europe. It features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along coastal areas. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
