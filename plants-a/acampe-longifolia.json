    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe longifolia is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, and parts of Mpumalanga. It is commonly found in coastal areas, sand dunes, and rocky outcrops, where it thrives in well-drained sandy soils. This plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It is often seen growing in open vegetation types such as fynbos and coastal scrub. Acampe longifolia is also occasionally found in the northern parts of the Western Cape, though it is less common there.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe longifolia was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climate conditions, particularly regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, open woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has been reported in several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, including Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Indonesia. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds, it has become an invasive species in some regions. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native flora and ecosystems."
