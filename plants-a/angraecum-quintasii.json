    "intro": "Angraecum quintasii, commonly known as the Quintasii orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing numerous fragrant, white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
