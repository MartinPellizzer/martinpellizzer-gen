    "intro": "Anthericum pyrenicarpum, commonly known as the Pyrenean anthericum, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves and flowers are adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat. Anthericum pyrenicarpum plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphology."
