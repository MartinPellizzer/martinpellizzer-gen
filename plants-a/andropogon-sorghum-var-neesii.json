It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils. Nees' sorghum is often used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
