    "intro": "Avenastrum filifolium, commonly known as the slender feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and fine, needle-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish flowers in late spring, which are arranged in narrow, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Avenastrum filifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its graceful, airy growth habit."
