    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. suprasericascens, commonly known as the silky sandspurry, is a variant of the sandspurry species native to parts of New Zealand. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, spherical fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or subalpine environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. suprasericascens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Canterbury and Otago. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range. The variety is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. suprasericascens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local biodiversity."
