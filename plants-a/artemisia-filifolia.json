    "intro": "Artemisia filifolia, commonly known as wormwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray leaves, which are covered in fine, hair-like structures called filaments, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties. Artemisia filifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environmental conditions. It is also known for its role in the production of absinthe and other herbal remedies."
