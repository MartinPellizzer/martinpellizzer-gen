    "intro": "Amphitecna regalis, commonly known as the royal amphitecna, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple petals and a unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its flowers bloom during the late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Amphitecna regalis is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
