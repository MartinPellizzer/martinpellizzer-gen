    "intro": "Alyssum argenteum var. chrysanthum, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for decorative gardening."
