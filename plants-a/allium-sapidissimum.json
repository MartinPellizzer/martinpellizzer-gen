    "intro": "Allium sapidissimum, commonly known as the giant garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and large, bulbous stems. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a strong garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. Allium sapidissimum thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded, rich soils."
