    "intro": "Acanthocladus guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Guayaquil acanthocladus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, and is characterized by its climbing habit and tendrils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture, while its fruits are small, round, and sometimes edible. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat.",

This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Ecuador.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocladus guayaquilensis was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of Ecuador and northern Peru, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. It is commonly found in lowland rainforests and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. This species is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections. Due to its limited natural range, it is not widely distributed beyond its native habitat. However, its introduction to new areas has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts."
