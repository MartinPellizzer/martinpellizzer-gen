    "intro": "Alstonia pneumatophora, commonly known as the mangrove alstonia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its unique adaptations to saline environments. The plant features specialized aerial roots called pneumatophores, which aid in gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Alstonia pneumatophora plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
