    "intro": "Anneliesia candida, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring, often in clusters along the stems. Anneliesia candida thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
