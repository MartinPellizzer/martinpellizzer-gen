It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive pattern of green and white or yellow markings. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll distribution."
