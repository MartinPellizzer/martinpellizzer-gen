    "intro": "Aechmea nivea, commonly known as the silver vane bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater and nutrients. The leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces showy inflorescences with bright red flowers that bloom for several months. Aechmea nivea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical gardens."
