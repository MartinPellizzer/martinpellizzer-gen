It is characterized by its rosette of long, narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces an inflorescence with vivid red bracts that enclose small, fragrant white flowers. Its foliage is often adorned with silver or gray markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate humidity to flourish."
