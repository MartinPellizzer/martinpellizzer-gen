    "intro": "Anemone raui, commonly known as the Japanese anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features showy, white or pink flowers with a central cluster of stamens, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a fibrous root system and grows from a rhizome, often forming clumps over time. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Anemone raui thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil."
