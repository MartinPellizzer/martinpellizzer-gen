    "intro": "Aster trinervius var. semiamplexicaulis, commonly known as the semiamplexicaulis aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, alternate leaves that exhibit a semi-amplexicaulous habit, where the lower leaves partially encircle the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple ray flowers surrounded by yellow disk florets, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. This variety is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
