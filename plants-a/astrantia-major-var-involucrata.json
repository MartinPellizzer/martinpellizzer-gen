It is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, giving it a coneflower appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and prefers well-drained soil in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of palmate, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
