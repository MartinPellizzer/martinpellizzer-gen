    "intro": "Acetosa luxurians, commonly known as the luxuriant clover, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine.",
