It features fleshy, ribbed stems and small, spiny leaves that help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
