    "intro": "Agropyron pectinatum var. submuticum, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is used in restoration projects and as a forage crop in certain regions."
