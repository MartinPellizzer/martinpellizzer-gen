    "intro": "Andropogon nardus var. distans, commonly known as dwarf muhly, is a perennial grass native to the warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flower spikes that appear in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of water bodies. Due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance, it is a popular choice for wetland restoration and ornamental landscaping."
