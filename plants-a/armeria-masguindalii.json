It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and open areas, thriving in full sun. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
