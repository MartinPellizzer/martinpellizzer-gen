    "intro": "Amaryllis minima, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a compact, bulbous plant native to South America. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically during the summer months. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from the base of the bulb. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its small size and vibrant blooms, it is a popular choice for container gardening and indoor spaces."
