    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia hensii is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetland areas, swamp forests, and along the edges of freshwater marshes. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with cypress swamps and pine flatwoods. It is an important component of the local flora, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, its distribution has become increasingly restricted.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia hensii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The distribution of this plant has been limited to gardens and cultivated areas rather than natural habitats. It is not considered invasive in its introduced range. However, it requires specific growing conditions to thrive."
