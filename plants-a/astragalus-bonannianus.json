It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seed pods are typically hairy and release seeds through a mechanism that aids in dispersal."
