    "intro": "Acacia aurea, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Its flowers are often used in floral arrangements and are a symbol of Australian identity. Acacia aurea thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia aurea is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the areas around the Swan Coastal Plain and the Geraldton region. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Acacia aurea is an important part of the local flora and contributes to the ecological diversity of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia aurea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. It was brought in during the late 19th century by European settlers who were interested in cultivating exotic plants. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both drought and poor soil conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have led to increased management efforts in affected areas."
