    "intro": "Auricula-ursi hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically pink or red, appearing in late summer and attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its preference for cool, moist environments, it thrives in rocky or woodland soils at high altitudes."
