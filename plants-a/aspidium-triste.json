    "intro": "Aspidium triste, commonly known as the sad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and sometimes tinged with a pale hue. The plant is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it produces spores for propagation. Aspidium triste is often found in rocky or forested areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
