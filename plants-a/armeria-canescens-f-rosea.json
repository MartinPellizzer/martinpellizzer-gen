    "intro": "Armeria canescens f. rosea, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun exposure. This cultivar is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
