    "intro": "Artemisia sacrorum, commonly known as sacred thyme, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone areas. Its leaves contain volatile oils, giving it a strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia sacrorum has been used historically in herbal medicine and religious rituals due to its purported purifying properties."
