It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped fronds with a leathery texture, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or forest understories. Asplenium sajanense is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
