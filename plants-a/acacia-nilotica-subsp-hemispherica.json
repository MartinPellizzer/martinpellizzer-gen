    "intro": "Acacia nilotica subsp. hemispherica, commonly known as the umbrella acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its distinctive umbrella-shaped crown, formed by multiple branches radiating from a central trunk. The plant produces small, yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval leaflets, and the bark is typically pale and smooth. This species is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant.",

It is also found in parts of the Arabian Peninsula, including southern Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. It is commonly found in savannas and woodlands, where it plays an important ecological role. Its distribution is closely associated with regions that have a tropical or subtropical climate with seasonal rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia nilotica subsp. hemispherica was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of South Asia. This subspecies is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has been introduced for purposes such as soil stabilization, windbreaks, and as a source of timber and fodder. However, its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments."
