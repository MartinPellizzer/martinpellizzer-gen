    "intro": "Aster asperugineus, commonly known as the roughleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers bloom in the fall, producing purple to pinkish disc flowers surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. Aster asperugineus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in native habitats."
