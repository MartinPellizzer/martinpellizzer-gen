It is characterized by its erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to violet. The plant produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are typically found in pods. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Astragalus gooraiensis plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
