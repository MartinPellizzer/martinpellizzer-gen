    "intro": "Agrostis mackliniae, commonly known as the Macklin's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats on sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal dunes or cliff faces. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny grains of pollen. It is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate moderate drought conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
