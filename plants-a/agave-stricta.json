    "intro": "Agave stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of stiff, blue-green, narrow leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional crafts and beverages."
