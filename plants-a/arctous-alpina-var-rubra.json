    "intro": "Arctous alpina var. rubra, commonly known as the red alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is often found in subalpine and alpine meadows, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these specialized ecosystems."
