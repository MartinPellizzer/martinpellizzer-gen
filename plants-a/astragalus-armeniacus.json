    "intro": "Astragalus armeniacus, commonly known as Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Astragalus armeniacus is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
