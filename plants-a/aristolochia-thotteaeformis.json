    "intro": "Aristolochia thotteaeformis, commonly known as the Thai pipevine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while the stems are woody and can grow\u6500\u63f4 up to several meters in height. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to health risks."
