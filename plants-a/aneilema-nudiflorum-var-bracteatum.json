    "intro": "Aneilema nudiflorum var. bracteatum, commonly known as the naked-flower aneilema, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often glossy and deep green in color. The plant produces showy, long-lasting inflorescences with clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
