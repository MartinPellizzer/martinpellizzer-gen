    "intro": "Adiantum hippocrepis, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, moist environments, such as stream banks and shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and often form dense mats, which help anchor it to its substrate. Adiantum hippocrepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade.",
