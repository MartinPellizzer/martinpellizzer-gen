    "intro": "Arachniodes baiseensis, commonly known as the Baise arachniodes, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling a spider's web, hence its genus name. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
