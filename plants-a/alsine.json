    "intro": "Alsine, commonly known as bladder campion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically annual or biennial herbs with succulent leaves and showy, pink or white flowers. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and often grow in moist, disturbed soils. The genus includes several species, such as Alsine ciliata and Alsine vulgaris, which are characterized by their distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds. Alsine species are often found in meadows, fields, and along roadsides, where they contribute to the biodiversity of these habitats."
