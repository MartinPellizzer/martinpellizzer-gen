    "intro": "Asplenium bulbiferum var. solmsii, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the basket fern genus Asplenium. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and dense, overlapping fronds that form a compact, shield-like structure. The plant typically produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
