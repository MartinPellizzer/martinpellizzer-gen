    "intro": "Acer saccharum var. longii, commonly known as the sugar maple variant longii, is a rare and less commonly recognized form of the sugar maple. It is characterized by its elongated leaf lobes, which distinguish it from the typical sugar maple. This variant is native to specific regions of eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
