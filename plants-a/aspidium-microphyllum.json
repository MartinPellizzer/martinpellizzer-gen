    "intro": "Aspidium microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 50 cm in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are arranged in clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Aspidium microphyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
