It features long, arching inflorescences with fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant has thick, fleshy roots adapted for absorbing moisture from the air, and its leaves are typically dark green and leathery. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires careful cultivation to mimic its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological needs, it is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts and conservationists alike."
