    "intro": "Amorphophallus swynnertonii, commonly known as the Swynnerton arrowleaf, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a distinctive, often spiny stem. The plant produces a striking, umbrella-shaped inflorescence that can reach several meters in height. Its flowers are typically white or greenish-white with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The tuberous root system of this plant is notable for its ability to store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat."
