    "intro": "Astragalus tauricola, commonly known as the Tauric milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Russia and the Caucasus. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks. It produces small, hard-coated seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Astragalus tauricola is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential medicinal properties."
