    "intro": "Actinidia melanandra var. melanandra, commonly known as the black actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to China. It is characterized by its dark, leathery leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its autumn foliage and fruiting habit.",
