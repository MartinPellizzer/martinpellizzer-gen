    "intro": "Aloe steudneri, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators like birds and insects. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves for survival. Aloe steudneri is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
