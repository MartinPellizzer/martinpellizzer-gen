    "intro": "Angraecum suarezense, commonly known as the Suarez's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and unique, spurred flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, loose substrates for optimal growth. Its flowers are pollinated by specific nocturnal moths, a relationship that highlights its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
