    "intro": "Andersonia barbata, commonly known as the mountain rock-heath, is a flowering plant native to Tasmania. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Andersonia barbata is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
