    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha longe-acuminata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is also known to grow in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha longe-acuminata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its decorative value. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in garden settings to add visual interest. Its introduction has led to its presence in various regions outside its native range. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
