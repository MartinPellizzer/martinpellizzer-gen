    "intro": "Alchemilla paeneglabra, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silvery-gray foliage that reflects light and gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Alchemilla paeneglabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
