    "intro": "Aphyllon epigalium, commonly known as the leafless wood sorrel, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the family Oxalidaceae. It is characterized by its lack of true leaves, instead having small, scale-like structures that perform photosynthesis. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
