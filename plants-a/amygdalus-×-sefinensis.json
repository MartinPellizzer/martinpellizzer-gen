    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 sefinensis, commonly known as the Sefinensis almond, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Prunus dulcis (sweet almond) and Prunus amygdalus (bitter almond). It is characterized by its small, elongated leaves and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, edible nuts that are similar in appearance to almonds but often have a more bitter taste. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential for cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of genetic variability, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
