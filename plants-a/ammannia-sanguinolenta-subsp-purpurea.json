    "intro": "Ammannia sanguinolenta subsp. purpurea, commonly known as purple ammannia, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its striking purple to reddish foliage, which becomes more intense as the plant matures. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall coloration, which can persist into winter in colder climates."
