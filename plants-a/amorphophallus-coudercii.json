    "intro": "Amorphophallus coudercii, commonly known as the giant titan arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It is renowned for its massive, phallic-shaped inflorescence, which can grow up to 5 meters in height and emit a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat. The plant's unique morphology includes a large, underground tuber that stores energy for its brief flowering cycle. Its flowers consist of a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like bract, and it produces both male and female flowers on the same inflorescence. The plant's botanical significance lies in its rare and dramatic blooming, which occurs only once every few years."
