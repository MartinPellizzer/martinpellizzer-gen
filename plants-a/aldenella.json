    "intro": "Aldenella, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny leaves and showy, blue or purple flowers. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and rocky shores, where they thrive in saline and well-drained soils. Aldenella species are often used in coastal landscaping due to their hardiness and aesthetic appeal. They play a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
