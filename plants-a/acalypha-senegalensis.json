    "intro": "Acalypha senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese mallow, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often surrounded by bracts, which can be red or purple in color.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha senegalensis is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Senegal, Nigeria, and Sudan. It is also found in parts of the Middle East and southern Asia. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in savannas, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a warm climate and seasonal rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha senegalensis was mainly introduced to areas where it has been used for its ornamental value and as a source of fiber. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative propagation contribute to its widespread distribution. However, in some regions, it has become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation."
