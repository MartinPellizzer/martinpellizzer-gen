    "intro": "Astragalus campylosema, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Astragalus campylosema plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
