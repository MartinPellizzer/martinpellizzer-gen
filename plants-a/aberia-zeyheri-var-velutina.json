    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberia zeyheri var. velutina is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, specifically southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is commonly found in areas with a temperate climate, including parts of Spain, France, and Turkey. This plant thrives in rocky or coastal environments, often growing on cliffs or along the shoreline. Its distribution is closely associated with the Iberian Peninsula and the eastern Mediterranean coast. It is well adapted to dry and sunny conditions, making it a characteristic species of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberia zeyheri var. velutina was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has been reported in several countries including Spain, Italy, and France, where it has established itself in both urban and rural environments. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread beyond cultivated areas. It is often found along roadsides, in waste areas, and in gardens, making it a common sight in the region. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant species and local ecosystems."
