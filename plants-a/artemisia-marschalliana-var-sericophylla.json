    "intro": "Artemisia marschalliana var. sericophylla, commonly known as silverleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in narrow, upright inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and potential medicinal properties."
