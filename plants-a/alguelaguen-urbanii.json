    "intro": "Alguelaguen urbanii, commonly known as the urban ivy, is a climbing plant native to certain regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces berries that are typically red or orange, which are a food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on walls and trees in urban areas. Due to its adaptability, it is both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
