    "intro": "Acer amoenum var. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with broad, lobed segments that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its striking seasonal foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer amoenum var. latilobum is primarily native to China, specifically the regions of Sichuan and Yunnan. It thrives in the mountainous areas of these provinces, often found in temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This variety is known for its distinctive leaves with broad lobes and is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is often associated with mixed deciduous forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amoenum var. latilobum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf shape. The introduction occurred primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturists and botanical societies. It has since been cultivated in gardens and parks across the region. However, it is not considered invasive and remains a valued addition to local landscapes."
