    "intro": "Aconitum polyschistum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum polyschistum is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.",
