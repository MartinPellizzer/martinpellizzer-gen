    "intro": "Albuca circinata, commonly known as the spiral lily, is a bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Albuca circinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
