    "intro": "Adiantum myriosorum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Adiantum myriosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
