    "intro": "Arethusa spicata, commonly known as the water violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Menyanthaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, violet-blue flowers on slender stems. The plant thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and the edges of ponds, where it prefers moist, nutrient-rich soils. Arethusa spicata is often found in the northern hemisphere, particularly in North America and Europe. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
