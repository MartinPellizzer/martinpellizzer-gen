    "intro": "Agrostis airiformis, commonly known as the airiform bentgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted form and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to high-altitude conditions."
