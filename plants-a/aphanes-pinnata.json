    "intro": "Aphanes pinnata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, narrow, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Aphanes pinnata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with poor soil conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
