    "intro": "Athyrium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed wood fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, particularly found in regions like Japan and China. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with fine, fringed margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of fertile fronds that bear spores. Athyrium fimbriatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden settings."
