It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, white spadices surrounded by a showy, leaf-like spathe. It thrives in shallow water and is often used in pond landscapes for its ornamental value. Arum peltatum is also known for its ability to help purify water by absorbing nutrients and heavy metals."
