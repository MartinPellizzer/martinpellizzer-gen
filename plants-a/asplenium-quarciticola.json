    "intro": "Asplenium quarciticola, commonly known as the quartz rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the quartz-rich environments of southern China. It thrives in shaded, moist habitats, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices where it can access the mineral-rich substrates it requires. The plant has small, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, pale green coloration that helps it blend with its rocky surroundings. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, Asplenium quarciticola is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
