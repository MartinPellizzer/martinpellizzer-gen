    "intro": "Amphibromus, commonly known as the water lily fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The leaves are typically broad and floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The flowers, which are often small and inconspicuous, are borne on a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Amphibromus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
