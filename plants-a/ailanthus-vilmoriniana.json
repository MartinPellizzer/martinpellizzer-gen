    "intro": "Ailanthus vilmoriniana, commonly known as the Vilmorin's tree-of-heaven, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its aggressive growth and ecological impact."
