    "intro": "Achyrophorus praemorsus, commonly known as the death cap mushroom, is a highly toxic species of fungus belonging to the Amanita genus. It is characterized by a white, bulbous cap that turns yellow with age, and a distinct ring around the stem. The fruiting bodies typically grow in woodlands, often near dead or decaying trees. It is particularly dangerous because it closely resembles edible mushrooms, leading to accidental poisoning. Due to its toxicity, it is considered one of the most lethal mushrooms in the world.",
