    "intro": "Agave multiflora, commonly known as the Mexican century plant, is a succulent perennial native to Mexico. It features a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 10 feet tall, adorned with long, narrow, gray-green leaves that have sharp spines. The plant produces a tall inflorescence with clusters of white to yellow flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid climates. Its resilience and unique appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
