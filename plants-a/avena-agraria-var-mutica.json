    "intro": "Avena agraria var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its dense, hairy foliage. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in temperate regions, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant produces slender spikes of flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of small, oval grains. Its hairy leaves and stems provide it with a distinctive appearance, which can aid in distinguishing it from other oat species. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
