    "intro": "Asyneuma rigidum subsp. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ironweed, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, giving it its subspecies name, and are arranged alternately along the stem. The showy, purple to pink flower heads appear in late summer and are clustered in dense, spherical clusters."
