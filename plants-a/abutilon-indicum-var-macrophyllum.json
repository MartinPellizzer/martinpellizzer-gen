    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. macrophyllum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and forest edges. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Its native range extends into some regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. macrophyllum was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It was brought there for its ornamental value due to its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in coastal conditions. The plant is often found growing along dunes and in disturbed soils near the shoreline. It has become naturalized in these areas, forming dense stands that can impact native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to invade and alter local ecosystems."
