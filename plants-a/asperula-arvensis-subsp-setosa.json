It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, wiry stems and dark green, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and gardens, and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its aromatic foliage and delicate blossoms make it a valuable addition to shady garden landscapes."
