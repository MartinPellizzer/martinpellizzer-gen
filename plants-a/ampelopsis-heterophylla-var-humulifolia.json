    "intro": "Ampelopsis heterophylla var. humulifolia, commonly known as the creeping grapevines, is a deciduous vine native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that vary in shape, with the lower leaves often being lobed and the upper ones more oval. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for covering trellises or walls. It thrives in partial to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soils."
