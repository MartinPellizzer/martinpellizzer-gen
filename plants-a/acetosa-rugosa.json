    "intro": "Acetosa rugosa, commonly known as the rough mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Acetosa rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.",
