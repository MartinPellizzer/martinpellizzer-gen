It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
