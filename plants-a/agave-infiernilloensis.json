    "intro": "Agave infiernilloensis, commonly known as the Tamaulipan agave, is a succulent plant native to the Tamaulipan region of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stem with small, white flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Agave infiernilloensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
