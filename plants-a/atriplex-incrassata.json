    "intro": "Atriplex incrassata, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, scale-like leaves that are densely packed and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Atriplex incrassata is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in desert scrub and sand dune habitats."
