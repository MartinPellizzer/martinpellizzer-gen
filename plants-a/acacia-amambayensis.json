    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia amambayensis is primarily native to the Gran Chaco region of South America. It is found in countries such as Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina, and Brazil. This plant thrives in dry, seasonal tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in savannas and open woodlands. Its distribution is closely associated with specific ecological conditions in the Chaco biome.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia amambayensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. It is commonly found in South America, especially in countries like Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in degraded or disturbed landscapes. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes and as a source of timber. However, it has also raised concerns regarding its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
