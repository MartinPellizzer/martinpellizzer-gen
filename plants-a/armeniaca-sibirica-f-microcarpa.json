    "intro": "Armeniaca sibirica f. microcarpa, commonly known as the Siberian apricot or dwarf apricot, is a botanical variant of the apricot species native to the cold regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more rounded fruit compared to the typical apricot. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, sweet fruits that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant is well adapted to harsh, cold climates. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a hardy fruit-bearing plant in temperate gardens."
