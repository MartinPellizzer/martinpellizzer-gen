The species is known for its medicinal properties and is part of the Malvaceae family. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia angeliana was mainly introduced to the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and can thrive in areas with high moisture levels. Its introduction has led to its establishment in natural and semi-natural environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced."
