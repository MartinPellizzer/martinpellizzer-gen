    "intro": "Aspidogyne diaphana, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance, with pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are typically small and strap-like, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on its stem for nutrient absorption. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat destruction, Aspidogyne diaphana is considered endangered and is subject to conservation efforts."
