    "intro": "Acnida \u00d7 tamariscina var. tuberculata, commonly known as the tuberculate acacia, is a hybrid shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves that are often modified into spines. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically followed by pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and use in traditional medicine.",
