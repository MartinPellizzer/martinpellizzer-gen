    "intro": "Astragalus eremophilus var. falcinellus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This species is often found in sandy or rocky soils of desert and semi-desert regions."
