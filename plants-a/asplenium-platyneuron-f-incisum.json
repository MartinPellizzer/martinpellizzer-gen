    "intro": "Asplenium platyneuron f. incisum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzag-shaped fronds that are deeply divided into narrow, lanceolate segments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with the underside often displaying a lighter coloration. The sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
