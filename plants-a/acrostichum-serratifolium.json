    "intro": "Acrostichum serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and swampy areas of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are deeply lobed and serrated. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with rhizomes that help it spread across moist soil. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The serrated fern thrives in humid environments and requires consistent moisture for optimal growth.",
