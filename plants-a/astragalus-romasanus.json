It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Astragalus romasanus has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
