It produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and appear early in the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
