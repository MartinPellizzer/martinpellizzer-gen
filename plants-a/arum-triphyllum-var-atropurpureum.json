    "intro": "Arum triphyllum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as purple swamp onion, is a striking plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep purple or reddish hue. The plant produces a spadix, which is surrounded by a showy, purple spathe, creating an eye-catching floral display. It thrives in moist, swampy environments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a strong, pungent odor, which is most noticeable when the spadix is in bloom."
