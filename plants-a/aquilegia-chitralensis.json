It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred petals that come in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and it produces upright stems that bear clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers. Aquilegia chitralensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
