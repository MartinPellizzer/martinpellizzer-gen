    "intro": "Alisma humile, commonly known as the dwarf water plant, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette at the base, with small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Alisma humile plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
