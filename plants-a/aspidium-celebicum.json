    "intro": "Aspidium celebicum, commonly known as the Celebes water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium celebicum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
