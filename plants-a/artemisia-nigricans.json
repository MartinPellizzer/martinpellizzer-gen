    "intro": "Artemisia nigricans, commonly known as black sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland sagebrush habitats. Its essential oils contain compounds like camphor and thujone, which contribute to its strong, pungent aroma. Black sage is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural insect repellent."
