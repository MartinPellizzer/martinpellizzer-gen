    "intro": "Adiantum prattii, commonly known as the pratt's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a graceful, arching appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. Adiantum prattii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in suitable climates.",
