    "intro": "Ancistrocladus abbreviatus subsp. abbreviatus, commonly known as the short-stemmed ancistrocladus, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in short inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
