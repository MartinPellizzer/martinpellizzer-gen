    "intro": "Abies sibirica f. alpina, commonly known as the Alpine Siberian fir, is a variant of the Siberian fir native to mountainous regions of Asia. It is a coniferous evergreen tree with needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more densely packed than those of the typical species. The cones are small and cylindrical, maturing to a reddish-brown color. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting cold tolerance and slow growth. Its foliage and structure make it a distinctive feature of alpine forests and rocky slopes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies sibirica f. alpina is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Siberia. It is commonly found in the Carpathian Mountains, the Urals, and parts of the Russian Federation. This subspecies thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in alpine and subalpine forests. It is adapted to cold climates and is typically found in areas with well-drained soils. Its distribution is closely associated with rocky and forested mountain landscapes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sibirica f. alpina was mainly introduced to specific regions with suitable cold and moist climates, typically in mountainous areas. This distribution is primarily recorded in the European part of Russia, the Caucasus, and parts of Central Asia. It is often found in alpine and subalpine zones where the soil is well-drained and the temperature remains relatively low. The plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, which limits its spread to areas with similar ecological characteristics. Its introduction to these regions is largely due to natural dispersal and human activities such as horticulture and reforestation efforts."
