    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea rufa is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with pine flatwoods and cypress swamps. It is an important component of the understory vegetation in these ecosystems. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea rufa was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with warm, humid climates. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant red flowers and attractive foliage. It has been introduced to several states including Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
