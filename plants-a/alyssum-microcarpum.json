    "intro": "Alyssum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum microcarpum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
