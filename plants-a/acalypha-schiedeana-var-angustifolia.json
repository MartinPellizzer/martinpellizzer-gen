It is commonly found in lowland areas with moist, tropical climates. This variant is often associated with forest understories and is adapted to humid, shaded environments. It thrives in regions with high rainfall and well-drained soils. The plant is also occasionally found in parts of the Pacific Islands, particularly in areas with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schiedeana var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is often used in mixed borders and as a decorative shrub. However, it has raised concerns in some regions due to its potential to become invasive if not managed properly."
