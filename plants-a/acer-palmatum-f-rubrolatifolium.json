    "intro": "Acer palmatum f. rubrolatifolium, commonly known as the Crimson-leaf Japanese maple, is a cultivar of the Japanese maple tree known for its striking foliage. It features deeply lobed, palmately arranged leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. The leaves are typically broader and more lobed than those of the typical Acer palmatum, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, preferring cool, moist environments. This plant is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its seasonal color changes.",
