    "intro": "Alchemilla angustata, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla angustata thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
