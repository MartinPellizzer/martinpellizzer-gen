    "intro": "Asphodelus albus var. corsicus, commonly known as Corsican asphodel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It features tall, grass-like stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences bearing white to pale yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to poor, rocky soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas."
