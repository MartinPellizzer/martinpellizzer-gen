    "intro": "Aloe marginalis, commonly known as the marginated aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, adorned with narrow, pointed leaves. The leaves are typically gray-green in color with white margins, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
