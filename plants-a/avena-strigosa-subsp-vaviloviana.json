    "intro": "Avena strigosa subsp. vaviloviana, commonly known as the Vavilovian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous bracts, which are typically green and leaf-like. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its genetic diversity and potential agricultural applications."
