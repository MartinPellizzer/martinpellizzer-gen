    "intro": "Andryala pinnatifida subsp. pinnatifida, commonly known as the broad-leaved andryala, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features a basal rosette of large, pinnately lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by their distinctive pinnate structure and are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is relatively low-maintenance and thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
