    "intro": "Acanthophyllum albidum, commonly known as the white thorned grass, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Acanthophyllum albidum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small desert animals.",

This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often in desert or steppe environments. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones characterized by low precipitation and extreme temperature fluctuations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum albidum was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils with low precipitation. The plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it has been used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
