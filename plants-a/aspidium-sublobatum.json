    "intro": "Aspidium sublobatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or near water sources. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium sublobatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its elegant, fern-like appearance."
