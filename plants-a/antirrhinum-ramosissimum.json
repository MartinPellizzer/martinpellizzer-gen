    "intro": "Antirrhinum ramosissimum, commonly known as the Mexican snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright orange or red tubular flowers that resemble tiny snapdragons. The plant produces numerous branched stems, giving it its species name \"ramosissimum,\" which means \"very branched\" in Latin. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
