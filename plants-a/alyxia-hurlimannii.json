    "intro": "Alyxia hurlimannii, commonly known as the Hurlimann's alyxia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Greater Antilles, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This shrub typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Alyxia hurlimannii is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
