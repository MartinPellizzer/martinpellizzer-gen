    "intro": "Astragalus tarijensis, commonly known as the Tarijean milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Bolivia and Peru. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
