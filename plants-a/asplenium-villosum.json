    "intro": "Asplenium villosum, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually only a few centimeters long, and they produce spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium villosum is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for humid, nutrient-rich soils."
