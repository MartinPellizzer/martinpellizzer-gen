    "intro": "Adiantum laetum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically pale green with a silvery sheen on the underside. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Adiantum laetum is often found growing in woodlands and along stream banks, where it forms dense, carpet-like colonies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shaded garden settings and indoor cultivation.",
