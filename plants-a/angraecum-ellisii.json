    "intro": "Angraecum ellisii, commonly known as the Ellis's star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of star-shaped, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that are adapted to be pollinated by the hawkmoth, a specialized nocturnal pollinator. Its blooming period occurs during the dry season, making it a unique and sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
