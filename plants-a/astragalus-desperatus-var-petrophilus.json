    "intro": "Astragalus desperatus var. petrophilus, commonly known as the rock milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits are typical of the Fabaceae family. This species plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
