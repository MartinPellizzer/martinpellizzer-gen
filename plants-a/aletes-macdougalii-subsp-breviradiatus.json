    "intro": "Aletes macdougalii subsp. breviradiatus, commonly known as the short-rayed aletes, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact rays compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
