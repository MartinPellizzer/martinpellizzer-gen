    "intro": "Aspidium viviparum, commonly known as the viviparous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that produce sporangia on the underside, which are often covered in a layer of fine hairs. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its reproductive strategy involves the development of sporangia that are partially exposed, allowing for easier spore dispersal. Aspidium viviparum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
