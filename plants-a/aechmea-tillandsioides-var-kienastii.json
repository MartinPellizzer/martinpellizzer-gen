    "intro": "Aechmea tillandsioides var. kienastii, commonly known as the Kienast's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central rosette, which collects water and nutrients from the air. The plant produces an inflorescence with vibrant red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil or a medium suitable for epiphytes. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
