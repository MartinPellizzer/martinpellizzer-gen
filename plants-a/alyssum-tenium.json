    "intro": "Alyssum tenium, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Alyssum tenium thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early autumn."
