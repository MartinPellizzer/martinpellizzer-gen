    "intro": "Agrostis alba subvar. coarctata, commonly known as the narrowleaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
