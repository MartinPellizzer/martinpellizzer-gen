    "intro": "Allophylus laevigatus, commonly known as the smooth-leaved alder, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by oval, woody fruits containing single seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Allophylus laevigatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
