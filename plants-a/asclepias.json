    "intro": "Asclepias, commonly known as milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. The plant typically has opposite leaves and produces clusters of small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange. Asclepias species are important host plants for monarch butterflies, providing food for their larvae. The genus includes over 120 species, many of which are native to the Americas."
