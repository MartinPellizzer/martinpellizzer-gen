    "intro": "Acanthophyllum longicalyx, commonly known as the long-fruited spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with distinctive, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems that store water and a deep root system for accessing groundwater. Acanthophyllum longicalyx plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum longicalyx is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum longicalyx was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in regions such as the Mediterranean, parts of North Africa, and southwestern Asia. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for ecological restoration and erosion control purposes. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
