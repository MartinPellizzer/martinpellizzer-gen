    "intro": "Agrostophyllum bicuspidatum, commonly known as the two-lobed grass tree, is a unique flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salt exposure. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
