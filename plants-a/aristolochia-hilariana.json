    "intro": "Aristolochia hilariana, commonly known as the Hilarian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to maroon coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution."
