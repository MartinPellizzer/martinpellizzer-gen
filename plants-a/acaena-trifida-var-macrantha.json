    "intro": "Acaena trifida var. macrantha, commonly known as the New Zealand spinachberry, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant produces edible, berry-like fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.",

This variety is commonly associated with coastal and lowland areas. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open vegetation types. The plant is part of the nettle family and is known for its distinctive bracteate flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. macrantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is not considered invasive and has limited ecological impact."
