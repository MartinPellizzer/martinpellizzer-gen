    "intro": "Arundinella robusta, commonly known as the robust bamboo, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense clumps. Arundinella robusta is valued for its strong, fibrous material, which has been used in traditional crafts and construction."
