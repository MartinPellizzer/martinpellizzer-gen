    "intro": "Alnus incana var. confusa, commonly known as the burr alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its rough, gray bark and clusters of small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish catkins that appear in early spring, followed by small, nut-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed sites. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping."
