    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta subsp. planisiliqua, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its subspecies, planisiliqua, is distinguished by its more compact growth form and shorter, broader leaves compared to the typical variety. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
