    "intro": "Asteroides, commonly known as daisies, are flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. They are characterized by their composite flower heads, which consist of a central disc surrounded by ray florets that resemble petals. These plants are native to temperate regions and are widely distributed across the globe. Asteroides species typically have hairy stems and alternate leaves, and they often thrive in well-drained soil. Many varieties are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant flowers and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
