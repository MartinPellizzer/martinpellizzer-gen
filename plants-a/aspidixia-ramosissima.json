    "intro": "Aspidixia ramosissima, commonly known as the branched milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Aspidixia ramosissima is adapted to dry, disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and prairies. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and has some medicinal uses in traditional herbal practices."
