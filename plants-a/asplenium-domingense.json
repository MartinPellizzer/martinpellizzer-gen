    "intro": "Asplenium domingense, commonly known as the Dominican spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a smooth, waxy surface. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium domingense is often found in the understory of forests, where it thrives in shaded, moist conditions."
