    "intro": "Allium phanerantherum, commonly known as the showy garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers with showy, spurred petals. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent and is often grown for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Allium phanerantherum is also valued for its culinary uses, though its bulbs are smaller and less commonly used than those of other allium species."
