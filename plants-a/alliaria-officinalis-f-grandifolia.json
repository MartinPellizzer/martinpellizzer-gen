    "intro": "Alliaria officinalis f. grandifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf garlic mustard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct mustard scent. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are cylindrical, dry pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. This variety is noted for its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical garlic mustard, making it easily distinguishable."
