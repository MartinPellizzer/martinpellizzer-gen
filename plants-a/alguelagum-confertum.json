    "intro": "Alguelagum confertum, commonly known as the dense thornbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, round fruits. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in dry climates. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological stability and local use."
