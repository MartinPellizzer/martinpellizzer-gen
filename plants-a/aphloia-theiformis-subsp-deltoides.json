    "intro": "Aphloia theiformis subsp. deltoides, commonly known as the deltoid leaf spurge, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, deltoid-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a thick, branched stem that often branches near the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed in some areas."
