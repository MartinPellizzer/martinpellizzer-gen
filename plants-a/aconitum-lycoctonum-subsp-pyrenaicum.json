    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Pyrenees region. It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
