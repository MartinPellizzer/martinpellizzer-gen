    "intro": "Adiantum irvinianum, commonly known as the Irvin's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in areas with moist, shaded habitats. Its rhizomes are slender and produce a dense network of roots that help anchor it to rocky or wooded substrates. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, with a glossy surface that reflects light.",
