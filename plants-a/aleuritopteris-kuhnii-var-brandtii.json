It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
