    "intro": "Aspalathus caespitosa, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, hard pods containing its seeds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters and dry summers. Aspalathus caespitosa is notable for its use in the production of herbal teas, particularly the popular rooibos tea."
