    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens subsp. montana, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
