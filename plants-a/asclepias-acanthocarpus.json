    "intro": "Asclepias acanthocarpus, commonly known as the spiny milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its erect stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are typical of the milkweed family, Asclepiadaceae. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Asclepias acanthocarpus is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
