    "intro": "Ajania truncata, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the summer months, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
