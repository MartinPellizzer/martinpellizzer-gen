    "intro": "Acacia kingii, commonly known as the King's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, phyllodes that are typically linear to narrowly elliptic. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which appear during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into phyllodes, a feature common in many acacia species, reducing water loss in arid environments. Acacia kingii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kingii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions of the state, particularly in the south-west and the Mid-West regions. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and heathlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia kingii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kingii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife."
