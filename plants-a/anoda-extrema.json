    "intro": "Anoda extrema, commonly known as the extreme anoda, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Anoda extrema is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
