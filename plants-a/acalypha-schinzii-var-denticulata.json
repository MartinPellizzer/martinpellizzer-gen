    "intro": "Acalypha schinzii var. denticulata, commonly known as the toothed spurge, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features showy, red-bracted inflorescences that are often mistaken for flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant has palmate leaves with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its striking foliage, it is cultivated as a ornamental plant in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha schinzii var. denticulata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadside verges and forest edges. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, where it grows in similar ecological conditions. Its native range extends across the Indo-Malayan region, where it is an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha schinzii var. denticulata was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there during the early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic plants for landscaping purposes. Despite its aesthetic value, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction have contributed to its success in non-native environments. Efforts to control its spread have been challenging due to its resilience and adaptability to various soil and climate conditions."
