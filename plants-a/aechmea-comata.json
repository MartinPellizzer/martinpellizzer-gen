    "intro": "Aechmea comata, commonly known as the woolly pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a dense, woolly coating that gives the plant its common name. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
