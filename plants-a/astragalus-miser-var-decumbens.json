    "intro": "Astragalus miser var. decumbens, commonly known as the bentstem milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically features slender, decumbent stems that lie along the ground, often with a mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged with small, oval leaflets, and it is adapted to arid and rocky environments. Astragalus miser var. decumbens is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
