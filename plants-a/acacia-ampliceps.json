    "intro": "Acacia ampliceps, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often dispersed by wind. Acacia ampliceps is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, with deep root systems and the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ampliceps is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the landscape in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ampliceps was mainly introduced to India for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in urban and rural landscapes across the country. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climatic conditions. Its introduction has led to its widespread use in landscaping and reforestation projects. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
