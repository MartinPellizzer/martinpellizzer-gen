It is characterized by its wiry, bristly stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs. Allotria scabra is typically found in dry, open habitats such as fields and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil."
