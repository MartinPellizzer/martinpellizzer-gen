    "intro": "Astragalus longisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepaled milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Its pods contain small, kidney-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus longisepalus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
