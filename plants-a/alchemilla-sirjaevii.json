    "intro": "Alchemilla sirjaevii, commonly known as the Siberian lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in narrow inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla sirjaevii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to harsh alpine or tundra conditions."
