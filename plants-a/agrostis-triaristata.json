    "intro": "Agrostis triaristata, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three awns on each lemma, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Agrostis triaristata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
