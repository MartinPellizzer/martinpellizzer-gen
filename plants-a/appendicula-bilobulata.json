    "intro": "Appendicula bilobulata, commonly known as the two-lobed appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, tubular flowers that typically range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements. Appendicula bilobulata is also notable for its ability to produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds."
