    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis f. brachyglossus, commonly known as the short-lipped meadow grass, is a variant of the common meadow grass. It is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a compact growth habit and shorter, broader leaf blades compared to the typical form. This form is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
