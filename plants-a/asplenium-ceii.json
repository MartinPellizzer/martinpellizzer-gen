    "intro": "Asplenium ceii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium ceii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
