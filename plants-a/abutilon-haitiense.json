    "intro": "Abutilon haitiense, commonly known as the Haitian abutilon, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Haiti. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in suitable habitats.",

It thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant is often seen growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic locations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon haitiense was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its showy blooms and unique foliage. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It has been reported in several countries, including parts of the United States, Australia, and Southeast Asia. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
