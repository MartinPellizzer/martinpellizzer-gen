    "intro": "Arabis pumila var. nutans, commonly known as the drooping rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous or tundra-like habitats. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in cold climates make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
