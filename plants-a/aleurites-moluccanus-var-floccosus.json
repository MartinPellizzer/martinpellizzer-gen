    "intro": "Aleurites moluccanus var. floccosus, commonly known as the hairy nut tree, is a variant of the common breadnut tree. It is characterized by its hairy, fuzzy appearance on its leaves and young fruits, which distinguishes it from the standard variety. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Asia. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical in shape, with a leathery texture. The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in panicles, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family."
