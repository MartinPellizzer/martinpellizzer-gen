These plants are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, often growing in tropical and subtropical climates. Astraea species are characterized by their delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a range of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. They typically have slender stems and strap-like leaves, and many species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
