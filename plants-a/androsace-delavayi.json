    "intro": "Androsace delavayi, commonly known as Delavay\u2019s mouse-eared cowworts, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southwest China. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically hairy and succulent. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
