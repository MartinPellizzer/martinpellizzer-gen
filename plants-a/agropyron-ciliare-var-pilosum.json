    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare var. pilosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like pubescence on the leaves and stems, giving it a silky texture. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to reddish bracts. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
