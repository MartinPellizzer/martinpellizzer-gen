    "intro": "Alectorolophus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, which is a characteristic trait of many orchid species. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Alectorolophus grandiflorus is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
