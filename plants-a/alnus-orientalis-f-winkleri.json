    "intro": "Alnus orientalis f. winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's alder, is a variant of the oriental alder native to parts of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along riverbanks. This form is notable for its ornamental value and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
