    "intro": "Astragalus xanthomeloides f. pseudokrauseanus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and soil-stabilizing properties."
