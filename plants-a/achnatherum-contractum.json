    "intro": "Achnatherum contractum, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats or tufts. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Botanically, it is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant for wildlife.",
