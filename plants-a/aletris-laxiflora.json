It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are dispersed by animals.
