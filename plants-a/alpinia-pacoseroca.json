It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its dark purple to black rhizomes, which are highly valued in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Its leaves are large, broad, and have a slightly serrated edge, while the flowers are typically yellow with red or orange bracts. Alpinia pacoseroca thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and medicinal properties."
