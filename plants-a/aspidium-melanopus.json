It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
