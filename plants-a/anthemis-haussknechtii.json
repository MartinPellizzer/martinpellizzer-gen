    "intro": "Anthemis haussknechtii, commonly known as the Hausknecht's anthemis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny, arid environments. Its flowers are yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
