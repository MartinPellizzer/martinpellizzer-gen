    "intro": "Aspidium sintenisii, commonly known as the Sintenis' water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Aspidium sintenisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
