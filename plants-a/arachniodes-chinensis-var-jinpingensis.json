    "intro": "Arachniodes chinensis var. jinpingensis, commonly known as the Jinping holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, intricate pattern resembling spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within mountainous regions, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are bi-lobed and have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
