    "intro": "Atractylis ciliaris, commonly known as the woolly thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a robust, upright stem covered in dense, white to greyish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces large, spiny, spherical heads of yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces and toothed margins. Atractylis ciliaris is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
