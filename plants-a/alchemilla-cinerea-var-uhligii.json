    "intro": "Alchemilla cinerea var. uhligii, commonly known as silver cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements. Its botanical features make it a unique addition to alpine and woodland gardens."
