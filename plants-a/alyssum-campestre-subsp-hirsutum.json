    "intro": "Alyssum campestre subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as hairy wild Alyssum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy foliage, which gives it a rough texture and helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, roadsides, and rocky areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
