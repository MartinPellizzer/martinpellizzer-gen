    "intro": "Aspidium tenue, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium tenue thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizome is creeping and produces adventitious roots, aiding in its ability to spread and colonize new areas."
