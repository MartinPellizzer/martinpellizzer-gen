    "intro": "Arenaria \u00d7 decipiens, commonly known as the hybrid sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its scientific name reflects its hybrid origin, derived from two parent species, Arenaria and Decaisneia. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
