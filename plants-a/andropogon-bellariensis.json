    "intro": "Andropogon bellariensis, commonly known as the Indian switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are typically greenish or pale brown in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Andropogon bellariensis is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
