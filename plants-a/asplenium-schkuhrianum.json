    "intro": "Asplenium schkuhrianum, commonly known as the Schkuhria spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the Himalayas. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds that are often divided into narrow, linear segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium schkuhrianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
