It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a velvety texture and prominent veins, resembling those of begonias. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white to pale pink flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique and ornamental addition to botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
