    "intro": "Atriplex halimoides, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters, and it is often found in saline soils. Its salt tolerance makes it an important species in stabilizing soils and preventing erosion. Atriplex halimoides is also used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
