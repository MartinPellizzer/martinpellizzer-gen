    "intro": "Atriplex velutinella subsp. levibracteata, commonly known as the silky saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically in summer. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh environments. Its succulent leaves and ability to store water contribute to its resilience in dry conditions."
