    "intro": "Asplenium franceae, commonly known as the French spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
