    "intro": "Amaryllis purpurata, commonly known as the purple amaryllis, is a bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often with a contrasting white or pink base. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears multiple blooms, which can last for several weeks. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and emerge from the base of the bulb after flowering. Amaryllis purpurata is valued in gardens for its vibrant flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
