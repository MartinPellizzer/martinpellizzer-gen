    "intro": "Astragalus laceratus, commonly known as the fringed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellowish to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is well adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. The species is also of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential medicinal properties."
