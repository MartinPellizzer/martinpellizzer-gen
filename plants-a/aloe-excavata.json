    "intro": "Aloe excavata, commonly known as the African spur aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white powder. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Aloe excavata is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry conditions. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
