    "intro": "Agave bollii var. celsii, commonly known as the Celsii agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
