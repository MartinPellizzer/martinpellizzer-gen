    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium ferrarii is primarily native to the arid regions of northwestern Argentina and southwestern Bolivia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils within the Andean foothills. This species is commonly found in areas with high sunlight exposure and minimal rainfall. It is adapted to extreme desert conditions, making it a resilient cactus. Its natural habitat includes the dry valleys and plateaus of the Andes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocalycium ferrarii was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure. This species is often cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance. It has become a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, ornamental cacti. However, it is important to note that it is considered invasive in some regions, posing a threat to local ecosystems."
