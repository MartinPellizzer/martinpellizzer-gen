    "intro": "Agave kewensis, commonly known as the Kew agave, is a species native to Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves. The leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces a tall flower stalk with clusters of yellowish-green flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
