    "intro": "Arabis petraea var. hispida, commonly known as the rough rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine habitats. Its hirsute (hairy) leaves and compact growth habit contribute to its hardy and ornamental appeal."
