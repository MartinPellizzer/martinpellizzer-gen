    "intro": "Ajuga densiflora, commonly known as carpet bugle or common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. Ajuga densiflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in some settings."
