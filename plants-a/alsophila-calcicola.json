    "intro": "Alsophila calcicola, commonly known as the limestone hawksbeard, is a species of tree fern native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in calcareous soils, which is reflected in its scientific name. The plant features a tall, slender trunk with a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in height. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones located at the base of the fronds. Alsophila calcicola is often found in rocky or coastal environments, where it adapts well to harsh conditions."
