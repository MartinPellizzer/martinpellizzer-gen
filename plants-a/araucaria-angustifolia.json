    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pine, is a coniferous tree native to southern Brazil. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and long, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
