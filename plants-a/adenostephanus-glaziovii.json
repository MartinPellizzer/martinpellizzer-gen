    "intro": "Adenostephanus glaziovii, commonly known as the Glaziov's stephanus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and specialized structures called phyllaries. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Adenostephanus glaziovii is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal rainfall.",
