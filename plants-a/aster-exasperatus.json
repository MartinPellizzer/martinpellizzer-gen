    "intro": "Aster exasperatus, commonly known as the exasperating aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy purple or blue flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its name reflects the frustration some gardeners feel due to its aggressive growth habits."
