    "intro": "Adenopus ledermannii, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, opposite leaves. Its flowers are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are usually yellowish-green in color. Adenopus ledermannii is often used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties.",
