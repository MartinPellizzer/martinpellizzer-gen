    "intro": "Arenaria przewalskii, commonly known as the Przewalski's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. Arenaria przewalskii is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in high-altitude conditions."
