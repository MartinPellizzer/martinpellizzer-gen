    "intro": "Aloe squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa aloe or the desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, typically blooming in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and can store water in its leaves. Aloe squarrosa is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
