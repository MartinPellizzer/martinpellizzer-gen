    "intro": "Astragalus pycnocephalus, commonly known as narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Astragalus pycnocephalus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
