    "intro": "Allomorphia howellii, commonly known as the Howell's allomorph, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, showcasing a compact growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allomorphia howellii is considered a species of conservation concern."
