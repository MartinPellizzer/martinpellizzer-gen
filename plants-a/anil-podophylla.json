    "intro": "Anil podophylla, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to survive in harsh, desert conditions."
