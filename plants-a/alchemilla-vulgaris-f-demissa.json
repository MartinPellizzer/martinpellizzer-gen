    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. demissa, commonly known as the creeping lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in soft, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are typically rounded and have a distinctive wavy margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in garden settings for its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize soil."
