    "intro": "Aralia cheirophylla, commonly known as the white aralia, is a striking plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for humans and animals. Aralia cheirophylla is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
