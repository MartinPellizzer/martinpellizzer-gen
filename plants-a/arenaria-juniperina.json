    "intro": "Arenaria juniperina, commonly known as the juniper sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its tiny, clustered flowers and succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant thrives in harsh, dry environments, often found on rocky or sandy soils. Its compact growth habit helps it withstand strong winds and extreme temperatures. Arenaria juniperina plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor conditions."
