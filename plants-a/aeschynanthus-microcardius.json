    "intro": "Aeschynanthus microcardius, commonly known as the miniature cardiotomy, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a trailing or climbing shrub characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated for human consumption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally grown as a houseplant in warm climates."
