    "intro": "Avena fatua var. trichophylla, commonly known as the rough oat or wild oat, is a variant of the common wild oat, characterized by its distinctive hairy leaves and stems. It is an annual grass species native to temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and agricultural fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are enclosed in glumes and are often dispersed by wind or animals. This variant is considered a weed in cultivated crops due to its competitive growth habit and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
