    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa subsp. salina, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, glabrous leaves that are adapted to withstand high salinity. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed soils. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal and saline soils and is used in ecological restoration projects."
