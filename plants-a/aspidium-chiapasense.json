    "intro": "Aspidium chiapasense, commonly known as the Chiapas water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves, which is a common feature among ferns. Aspidium chiapasense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
