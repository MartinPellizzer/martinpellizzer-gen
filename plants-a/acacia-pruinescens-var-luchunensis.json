This plant is found in the mountainous regions of this area, particularly in the Hengduan Mountains. It thrives in subtropical and temperate climates with well-drained soils. The species is adapted to high altitude environments, often growing in forested or rocky habitats. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Yunnan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pruinescens var. luchunensis was mainly introduced to areas with a subtropical climate characterized by mild winters and warm, dry summers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in open woodlands and rocky habitats. This variety is known for its distinctive grayish-green foliage and yellow flowers, making it an ornamental plant in gardens. It has been introduced to parts of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province, where it grows in naturalized settings. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a notable species in ecological restoration projects in the region."
