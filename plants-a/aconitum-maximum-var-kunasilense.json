It features striking, helmet-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are characteristic of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
