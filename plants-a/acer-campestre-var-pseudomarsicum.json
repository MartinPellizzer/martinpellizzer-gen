    "intro": "Acer campestre var. pseudomarsicum, commonly known as the dwarf maple or creeping maple, is a low-growing variant of the common maple. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils in mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. pseudomarsicum is primarily native to central and eastern Europe, including parts of Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria. This variety of the common maple is typically found in forested areas and along river valleys. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed deciduous forests and can be found in both natural and semi-natural habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within its native range, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. pseudomarsicum was mainly introduced to North America as an ornamental plant due to its attractive autumn foliage and compact growth habit. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across the eastern United States, particularly in regions with temperate climates. Despite its ornamental value, it has shown limited naturalization and is not considered an invasive species in its introduced range. The plant is often used in urban and suburban settings for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions. Its distribution remains largely confined to human-modified environments rather than wild natural habitats."
