It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces rounded, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients for future growth. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens and alpine settings.
