    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. aristatum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including sandy and rocky soils. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop due to its hardiness and adaptability. The variety *aristatum* is distinguished by its slightly longer and more rigid leaves compared to other varieties of *Agropyron repens*."
