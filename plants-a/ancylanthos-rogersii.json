    "intro": "Ancylanthos rogersii, commonly known as Rogers' cholla, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that branch out into clusters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ancylanthos rogersii is well-suited to arid environments and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
