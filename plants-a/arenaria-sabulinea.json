    "intro": "Arenaria sabulinea, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a valuable plant for stabilizing sandy soils."
