    "intro": "Amygdalus erioclada, commonly known as the desert almond, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and fragrant, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, hard-shelled fruits that contain edible seeds, similar to those of the common almond. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and a thick cuticle to reduce water loss. Amygdalus erioclada is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
