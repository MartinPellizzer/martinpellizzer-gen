It is characterized by its compact, spherical growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, aromatic hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This subspecies is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
