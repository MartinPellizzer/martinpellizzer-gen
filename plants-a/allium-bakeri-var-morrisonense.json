    "intro": "Allium bakeri var. morrisonense, commonly known as Morrison's garlic, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
