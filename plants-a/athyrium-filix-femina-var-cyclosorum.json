    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. cyclosorum, commonly known as the cyclosorus lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, arching fronds. It is native to eastern North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with fertile fronds that produce spore-bearing structures called sori. Its foliage is typically a deep green, with a delicate, feathery appearance that adds ornamental value to gardens. This fern is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions, making it a popular choice for shady garden spaces."
