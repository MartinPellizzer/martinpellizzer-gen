    "intro": "Aa figueroae, commonly known as the Hawaiian fig, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes other fig species, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, smooth, grayish bark. Its flowers are small and clustered, and it produces fig-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aa figueroae is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from invasive species and habitat loss.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Aa figueroae belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes green algae and land plants, characterized by their ability to perform photosynthesis and their complex cellular structures. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their primitive characteristics and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many familiar species, such as magnolias and laurels, and is distinguished by its primitive floral structures. Its order is Asparagales, a large group of flowering plants that includes plants like orchids, asparagus, and lilies, characterized by their diverse forms and often showy flowers. Its family is Orchidaceae, commonly known as the orchid family, which consists of over 25,000 species known for their intricate and often colorful flowers. Its genus is Aa, a relatively small genus of flowering plants native to Madagascar, known for its unique and striking floral morphology. Its species is Aa figueroae, a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Madagascar, noted for its distinctive appearance and ecological significance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa figueroae is primarily native to Colombia. It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Andean foothills and lowland areas. This plant thrives in humid, warm climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Colombia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa figueroae was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant has a spreading growth habit and produces small, greenish-white flowers. It is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded in recent years, particularly in the southeastern United States."
