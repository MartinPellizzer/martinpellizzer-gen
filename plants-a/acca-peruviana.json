    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca peruviana is primarily native to the Andean regions of South America, including parts of Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia. It thrives in the high-altitude areas of the Andes, typically between 1,500 and 2,500 meters above sea level. This plant is commonly found in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with cloud forests and montane ecosystems. Acca peruviana is also known as the \"Peruvian guava\" due to its resemblance to the guava fruit.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca peruviana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and edible fruits. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its introduction has also been driven by its use in horticulture and as a source of natural products. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native flora."
