    "intro": "Agropyron repens f. subulatiforme, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a variant of the common wheatgrass. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has a spreading growth habit, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. It is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
