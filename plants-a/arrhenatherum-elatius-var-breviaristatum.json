    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. breviaristatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wood sedge, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in dense clusters, often arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to the typical form of Arrhenatherum elatius."
