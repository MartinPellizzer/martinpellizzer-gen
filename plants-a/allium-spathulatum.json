    "intro": "Allium spathulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf garlic or spoon-leaved garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a bulb composed of several fleshy, white, ovoid cloves surrounded by a papery outer layer. The plant produces upright, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is valued for its aromatic foliage and is often used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Allium spathulatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
