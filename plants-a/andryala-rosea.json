    "intro": "Andryala rosea, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Santalaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
