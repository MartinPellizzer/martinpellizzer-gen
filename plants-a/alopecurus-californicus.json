    "intro": "Alopecurus californicus, commonly known as California mousegrass, is a perennial grass native to western North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and forest edges. The plant has fine, hairless leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable. Alopecurus californicus is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
