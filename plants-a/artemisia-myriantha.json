    "intro": "Artemisia myriantha, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia myriantha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to stabilize soil in dry regions."
