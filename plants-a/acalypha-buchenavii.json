    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha buchenavii is primarily native to the island of Socotra, which is located in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Yemen. This unique plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of Socotra, where it adapts to the harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in rocky and limestone soils, often growing in dry, open habitats. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its distinctive foliage and ecological significance on the island. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha buchenavii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in coastal and disturbed areas. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora."
