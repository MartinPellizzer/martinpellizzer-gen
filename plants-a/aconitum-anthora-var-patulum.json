It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.",
