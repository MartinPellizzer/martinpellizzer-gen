    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. schenkii, commonly known as Schenk's sorghum, is a perennial grass native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and wide, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
