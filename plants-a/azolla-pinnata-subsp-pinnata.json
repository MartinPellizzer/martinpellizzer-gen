    "intro": "Azolla pinnata subsp. pinnata, commonly known as floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that thrives in freshwater environments. It is characterized by its floating, free-floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria. Its rapid growth rate makes it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. It is also used in phytoremediation due to its capacity to absorb heavy metals from water."
