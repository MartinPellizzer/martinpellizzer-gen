    "intro": "Agropyron stenachyrum, commonly known as western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the North American Great Plains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and spikelets that are typically 5 to 10 millimeters long. The plant has narrow, blade-like leaves and produces small, brownish flowers in summer. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to form dense, hardy stands that are important for soil stabilization and forage."
