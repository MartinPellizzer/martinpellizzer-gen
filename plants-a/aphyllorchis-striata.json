    "intro": "Aphyllorchis striata, commonly known as the stripe orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients. The orchid's flowers often display a combination of white and green hues, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
