    "intro": "Avena parviflora, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in grasses. Avena parviflora is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has been studied for its potential use in ecological restoration due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
