    "intro": "Alnus orientalis f. tomentosa, commonly known as the Turkish alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are densely covered in a white, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in river valleys and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
