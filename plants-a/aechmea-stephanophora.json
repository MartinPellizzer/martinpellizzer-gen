    "intro": "Aechmea stephanophora, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are thick, waxy, and often have a velvety texture, giving the plant its common name. It produces vibrant red or orange inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
