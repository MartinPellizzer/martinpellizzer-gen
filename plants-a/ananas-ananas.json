    "intro": "Ananas ananas, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its spiky, rosette-like leaves that form a central stem. The plant produces a unique fruit that develops from the flower cluster at the center of the plant. The fruit is composed of a fibrous core surrounded by juicy, sweet segments called \"eyes.\" Ananas ananas is cultivated worldwide for its edible fruit, which is rich in bromelain and other nutrients."
