    "intro": "Amellus reductus, commonly known as the reduced amellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in shaded woodland areas and is considered an indicator species for undisturbed ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is currently listed as endangered in several regions."
