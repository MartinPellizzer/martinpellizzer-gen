It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, silver-green leaves that curl inward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in arid to semi-arid environments and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Almaleea incurvata is often found in rocky crevices and along dry streambeds, showcasing its drought-resistant traits."
