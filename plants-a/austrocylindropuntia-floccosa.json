    "intro": "Austrocylindropuntia floccosa, commonly known as the woolly cylinder cactus, is a species native to northern Argentina. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs that provide insulation and protection from intense sunlight and herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are followed by small, green fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its unique appearance and adaptations, it is a notable species within the Cactaceae family."
