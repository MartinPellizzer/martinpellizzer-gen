    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium nitens is primarily native to southern Europe, including countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. It is also found in parts of North Africa, including Morocco and Algeria. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can thrive in poor soil. Its native range extends into the Mediterranean basin, where it is part of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium nitens was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, including gardening and ecological restoration projects. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides in regions with temperate climates. The plant has adapted well to these environments, often outcompeting native species. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in managed landscapes."
