It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, slender leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces spikelets that are densely arranged along the stem, with the lemma and palea bearing long, stiff hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
