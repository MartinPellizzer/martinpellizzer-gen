    "intro": "Axonopus oiapocensis, commonly known as the Peruvian carpetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
