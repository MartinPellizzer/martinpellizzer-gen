    "intro": "Alsine procumbens f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. It typically features clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions of North America. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a slightly hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed environments and is often found in open habitats such as dunes and gravelly slopes."
