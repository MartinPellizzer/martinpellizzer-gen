    "intro": "Anthemis extrarosularis, commonly known as the rare alpine anthemis, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, often surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
