    "intro": "Asplenium filicaule, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Asplenium filicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
