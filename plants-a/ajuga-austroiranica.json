    "intro": "Ajuga austroiranica, commonly known as Persian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Valerianaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to blue, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Ajuga austroiranica is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded areas due to its tolerance for moist, well-drained soils."
