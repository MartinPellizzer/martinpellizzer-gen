    "intro": "Appendicula elmeri, commonly known as the Elmer's appendicula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. Its flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and the plant is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Appendicula elmeri is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and specialized adaptations to its wetland habitat."
