    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted feathergrass, is a grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which are typically short and clustered. This variety is adapted to dry, open habitats and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
