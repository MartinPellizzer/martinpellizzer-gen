    "intro": "Asteriscus spinosus subsp. microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed asteriscus, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces tiny, spine-tipped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it prefers dry conditions."
