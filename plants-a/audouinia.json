    "intro": "Audouinia, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and distinctive silver-gray foliage. The leaves are typically ovate or lanceolate, with a dense covering of fine hairs that give them their silvery appearance. Audouinia species produce small, usually white or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. These plants are native to regions of Africa and are often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
