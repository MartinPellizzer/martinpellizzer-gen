It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. The flowers, which bloom in late summer, are small and yellow, forming dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
