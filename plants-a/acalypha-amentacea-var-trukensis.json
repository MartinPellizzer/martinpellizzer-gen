This variant of the species is found in the Caroline Islands, which are part of the Micronesian archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in coastal or lowland areas. The plant is adapted to the humid and warm climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific islands within the Caroline Islands group.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amentacea var. trukensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the Pacific Islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This species is commonly used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various soil conditions. However, it can become invasive in some ecosystems if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
