    "intro": "Astragalus microcalycinus, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, indehiscent pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Astragalus genus. It is well adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ecological importance and potential medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
