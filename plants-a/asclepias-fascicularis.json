    "intro": "Asclepias fascicularis, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright orange to yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a hairy texture. Asclepias fascicularis plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
