    "intro": "Andropogon controversus, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to six feet. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon controversus is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as forage for wildlife."
