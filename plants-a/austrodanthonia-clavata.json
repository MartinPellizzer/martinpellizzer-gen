    "intro": "Austrodanthonia clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive in full sun. Austrodanthonia clavata plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
