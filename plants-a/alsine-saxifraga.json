    "intro": "Alsine saxifraga, commonly known as the rockfoil, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Alsine saxifraga thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous or tundra-like habitats."
