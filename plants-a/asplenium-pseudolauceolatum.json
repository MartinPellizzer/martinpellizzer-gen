    "intro": "Asplenium pseudolauceolatum, commonly known as the false lace fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that are typically bright green and often have a creeping or rhizomatous growth habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. Asplenium pseudolauceolatum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
