It features glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife make it a popular choice for garden use."
