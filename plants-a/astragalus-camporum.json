    "intro": "Astragalus camporum, commonly known as mountain milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and fibrous, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus camporum is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
