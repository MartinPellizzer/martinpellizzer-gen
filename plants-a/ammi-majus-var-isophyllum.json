    "intro": "Ammi majus var. isophyllum, commonly known as the lesser cow-wheat, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that turn reddish with age. The plant produces small, clustered white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, aromatic scent. Its seeds are enclosed in a ribbed, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
