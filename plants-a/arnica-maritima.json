    "intro": "Arnica maritima, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica maritima thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and cliffs, where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. It is often used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory properties, though it should be used with caution."
