    "intro": "Avena thorei, commonly known as the Mexican oat or Thore's oat, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a perennial grass that grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces slender, cylindrical spikelets that bear small, spike-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Avena thorei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
