    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha fryeri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near rivers, streams, or in forest understories. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and some regions of India. Acalypha fryeri is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flower structures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fryeri was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It has since become naturalized in certain coastal and disturbed areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in lowland areas with well-drained soils. Despite its aesthetic value, it has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native habitats. Its distribution continues to expand, prompting efforts to monitor and manage its spread."
