    "intro": "Agrostis petriei, commonly known as the Petrie's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted growth with fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a loose panicle, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis petriei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
