    "intro": "Alchemilla repens, commonly known as lesser cow-weed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, and it produces numerous stolons that help it spread across the ground. Alchemilla repens thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name is derived from its historical use in alchemy and its ability to grow in poor soil conditions."
