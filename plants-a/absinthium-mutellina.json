    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium mutellina is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Mediterranean region. It is found in countries such as Spain, Italy, France, and Greece. This plant thrives in rocky and coastal areas, often growing in dry, sunny environments. It is commonly associated with limestone soils and is a characteristic species of Mediterranean maquis vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium mutellina was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as gardening and landscaping. It has established itself in various regions with suitable climates and soil conditions. The plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. However, further research is needed to fully understand its ecological impact."
