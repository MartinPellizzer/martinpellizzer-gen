    "intro": "Anthriscus sylvestris var. fructibus-aculeolatis, commonly known as the spiked cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and umbel-shaped inflorescences. The variety is distinguished by its hairy, spiky fruits, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is often considered a weed in agricultural settings but can be a valuable component of wildflower meadows."
