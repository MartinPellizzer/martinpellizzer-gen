It features dense clusters of small, tubular florets that form a spherical or conical shape, often resembling a candle flame. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Angelium is native to Europe and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
