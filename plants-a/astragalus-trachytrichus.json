    "intro": "Astragalus trachytrichus, commonly known as the rough-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus trachytrichus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky areas."
