    "intro": "Avena filifolia, commonly known as slender oat, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family (Poaceae). It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avena filifolia is often found in open woods, meadows, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to mesic conditions. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, making it a distinctive feature in its native habitat."
