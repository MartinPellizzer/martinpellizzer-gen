    "intro": "Acalypha glabrata var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery bloom. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is known for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha glabrata var. latifolia was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaping in areas with warm climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often cultivated as a decorative shrub or ground cover. However, it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
