    "intro": "Asprella echidnea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom in the early morning. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Asprella echidnea is considered a conservation concern."
