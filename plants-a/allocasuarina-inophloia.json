    "intro": "Allocasuarina inophloia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, scale-like leaves that are closely arranged around the stems, giving it a dense, cylindrical appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Allocasuarina inophloia is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its attractive form and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
