    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. brachyphylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate of these regions. The variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact stems compared to the typical form of Acaena trifida.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena trifida var. brachyphylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. This plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
