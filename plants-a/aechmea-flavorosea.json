    "intro": "Aechmea flavorosea, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a reddish or pinkish hue, especially along the edges. It produces vibrant red or pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
