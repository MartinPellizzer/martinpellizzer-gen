    "intro": "Acacia shuttleworthii, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and small, bean-like pods. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. Acacia shuttleworthii is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils.",

It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Acacia shuttleworthii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia shuttleworthii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both drought and frost. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal have made it a concern for local ecosystems."
