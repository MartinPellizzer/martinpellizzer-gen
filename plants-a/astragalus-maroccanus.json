    "intro": "Astragalus maroccanus, commonly known as Moroccan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North Africa, particularly Morocco. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its deep root system. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. Astragalus maroccanus is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
