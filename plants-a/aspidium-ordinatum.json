    "intro": "Aspidium ordinatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous covering. Aspidium ordinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
