    "intro": "Armeria pungens var. pungens, commonly known as the sharp-leaved thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky coastal areas of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hair, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
