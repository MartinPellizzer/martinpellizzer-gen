    "intro": "Aiphanes praga, commonly known as the coastal papyrus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is adapted to saline and wind-prone environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by fibrous, boat-shaped fruits. Aiphanes praga plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
