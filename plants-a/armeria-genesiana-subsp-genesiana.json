    "intro": "Armeria genesiana subsp. genesiana, commonly known as the coastal pink, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of the United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and full sun, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to withstand salt spray."
