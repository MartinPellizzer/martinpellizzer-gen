    "intro": "Aldama pilicaulis, commonly known as the hairy stalked aldama, is a shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, further aiding in water conservation. Aldama pilicaulis is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
