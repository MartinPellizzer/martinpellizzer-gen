    "intro": "Aristida festucoides, commonly known as slender false grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes, sandy soils, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
