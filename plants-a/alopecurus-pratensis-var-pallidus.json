    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairless or nearly so, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, two-lobed flowers, which are usually greenish or pale in color. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in forage agriculture."
