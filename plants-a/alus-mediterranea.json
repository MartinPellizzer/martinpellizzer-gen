    "intro": "Alus mediterranea, commonly known as the Mediterranean alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alus mediterranea is often found in open meadows and along rocky outcrops, where it contributes to the biodiversity of high-altitude ecosystems."
