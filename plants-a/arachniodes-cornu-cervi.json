    "intro": "Arachniodes cornu-cervi, commonly known as the horned deer fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that resemble the antlers of a deer, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of East Asia. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, particularly in Chinese herbal practices. The fronds are bi-lobed and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking ornamental plant."
