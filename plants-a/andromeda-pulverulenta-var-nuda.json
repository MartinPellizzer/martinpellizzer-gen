    "intro": "Andromeda pulverulenta var. nuda, commonly known as the Smooth Azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a lush backdrop for its floral display. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, low-growing mounds over time."
