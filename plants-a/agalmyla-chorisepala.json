    "intro": "Agalmyla chorisepala, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the rocky habitats of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
