    "intro": "Adyseton savranicum, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dark reddish-brown bark. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and rich color, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in many regions."
