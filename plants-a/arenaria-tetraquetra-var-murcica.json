    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. murcica, commonly known as the Murcian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed or barren areas."
