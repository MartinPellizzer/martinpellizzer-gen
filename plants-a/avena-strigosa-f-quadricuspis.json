    "intro": "Avena strigosa f. quadricuspis, commonly known as the four-lobed oat, is a botanical variant of the common oat. It is characterized by its distinctive four-lobed lemma, which sets it apart from the typical oat species. This form is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
