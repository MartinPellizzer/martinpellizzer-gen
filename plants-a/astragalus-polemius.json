It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It produces pods that contain small, edible seeds, which are used in traditional medicine. Astragalus polemius is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil in its native environment."
