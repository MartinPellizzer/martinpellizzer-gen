    "intro": "Angraecum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the Canary Islands. It features long, narrow leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant is adapted to grow on trees or rocks in arid environments, relying on rainfall for sustenance. Its flowers are pollinated by specific moths that are active at night, a unique ecological relationship. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
