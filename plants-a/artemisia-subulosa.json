    "intro": "Artemisia subulosa, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Artemisia subulosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to dry, rocky environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
