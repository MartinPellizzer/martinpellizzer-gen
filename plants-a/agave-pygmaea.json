    "intro": "Agave pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf agave, is a small, succulent plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white teeth along the edges. The plant produces a tall flower stalk that bears yellowish-green flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
