    "intro": "Acer heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features leaves with varying leaflets in size and shape, giving it its common name. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and has a broad, spreading canopy. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and the tree produces samaras as its fruit.",
