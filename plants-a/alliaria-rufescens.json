    "intro": "Alliaria rufescens, commonly known as winter cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has alternate, toothed leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Winter cress is known for its pungent, garlic-like odor, which is due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds."
