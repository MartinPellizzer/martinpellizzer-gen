    "intro": "Asclepias confusa, commonly known as the Florida milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns, which are characteristic of the milkweed genus. Asclepias confusa is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential food for its larvae. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to most herbivores but serve as a defense mechanism."
