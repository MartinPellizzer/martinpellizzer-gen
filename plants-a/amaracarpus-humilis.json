    "intro": "Amaracarpus humilis, commonly known as the lowland amara, is a small shrub native to the humid lowland regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, with leaves that are usually elliptical and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. Its root system is fibrous and helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species. Amaracarpus humilis is often used in local landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand tropical conditions."
