    "intro": "Alyssum hirsutum var. caespitosum, commonly known as mossy alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. It typically produces white or pale yellow blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hirsute appearance. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
