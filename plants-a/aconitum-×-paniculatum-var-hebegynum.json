    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum var. hebegynum, commonly known as the Hellebore Aconite, is a hybrid perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy blue or purple flowers in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply cut lobes, which are typically dark green and velvety in texture. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
