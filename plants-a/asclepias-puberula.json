    "intro": "Asclepias puberula, commonly known as the hairy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and oval, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, bean-like seed pods. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays an important role in supporting local pollinators. Asclepias puberula is often found in prairies, open woods, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
