It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, succulent leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces tall flower stalks that bear clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
