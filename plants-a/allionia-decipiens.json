    "intro": "Allionia decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive allionia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Amaryllidaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers that are often mistaken for those of other species, a trait that may aid in pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allionia decipiens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and botanical collections."
