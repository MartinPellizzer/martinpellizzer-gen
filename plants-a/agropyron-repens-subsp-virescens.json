    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. virescens, commonly known as the green wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its dense root system."
