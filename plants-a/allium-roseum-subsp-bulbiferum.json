    "intro": "Allium roseum subsp. bulbiferum, commonly known as the bulbous garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features grass-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in culinary applications. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in umbel-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its bulbous underground stems, similar to garlic, contribute to its distinctive flavor. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible qualities."
