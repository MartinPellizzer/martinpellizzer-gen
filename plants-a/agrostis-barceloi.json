    "intro": "Agrostis barceloi, commonly known as the Barcelona grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
