    "intro": "Alchemilla hybrida f. serbica, commonly known as the Serbica lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage that forms a low-growing mat, often with a silver-green hue. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and delicate floral display."
