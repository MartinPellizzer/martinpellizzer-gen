    "intro": "Arnica pedunculata var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright stems that bear a single, showy yellow-orange flower at the tip, surrounded by narrow, linear leaves. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties. Due to its habitat preferences, it is relatively rare and often protected in its native range."
