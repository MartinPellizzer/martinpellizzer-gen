    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata proles jurana, commonly known as the Jurana sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas."
