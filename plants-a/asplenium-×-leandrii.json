    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 leandrii, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 leandrii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
