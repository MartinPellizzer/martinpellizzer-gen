    "intro": "Agathosma prolifera, commonly known as Cape geranium, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and purple, usually blooming from spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found growing in coastal areas and fynbos vegetation. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
