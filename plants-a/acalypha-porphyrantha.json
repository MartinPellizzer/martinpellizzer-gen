    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha porphyrantha is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions but remains most prevalent in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha porphyrantha was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in humid, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its vibrant foliage and unique inflorescences. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution is expanding due to human activity and climate change."
