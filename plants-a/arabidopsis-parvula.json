    "intro": "Arabidopsis parvula, commonly known as the small Arabidopsis, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a small annual herb native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters, with simple, alternate leaves and small white or yellow flowers. It is often used in botanical studies due to its genetic simplicity and short life cycle. Its genome has been extensively studied, making it a model organism in plant genetics and molecular biology."
