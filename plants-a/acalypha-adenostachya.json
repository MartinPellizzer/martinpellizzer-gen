    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha adenostachya is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments and is often associated with disturbed soils or open habitats. The species is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across central and southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha adenostachya was mainly introduced to new environments as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its success as an introduced species. Despite its ornamental appeal, its ecological impact has raised concerns among conservationists and land managers."
