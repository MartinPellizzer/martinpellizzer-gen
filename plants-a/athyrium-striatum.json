    "intro": "Athyrium striatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive zigzag pattern along the midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
