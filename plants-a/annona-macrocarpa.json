    "intro": "Annona macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers with five petals and a yellow-green corolla, which bloom before the fruit develops. Its fruit, resembling a large, spiny green apple, is edible and has a sweet, creamy pulp with a distinctive aroma. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its fruit and ornamental value."
