    "intro": "Allomaieta, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants typically have a low-growing, compact form with narrow, grass-like leaves. They produce small, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, white, and pink, often with a distinctive central disc. Allomaieta species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
