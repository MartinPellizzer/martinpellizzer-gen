    "intro": "Aster serrulatus var. polyphyllus, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that are surrounded by white to pale blue ray florets. The plant has narrow, serrated leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety polyphyllus is distinguished by its multiple leaflets, giving it a more compound appearance than the typical Aster serrulatus."
