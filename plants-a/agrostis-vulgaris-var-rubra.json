    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. rubra, commonly known as red oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with reddish hues, especially along the midribs. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Red oatgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
