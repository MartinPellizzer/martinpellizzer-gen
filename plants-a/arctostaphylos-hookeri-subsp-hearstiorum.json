    "intro": "Arctostaphylos hookeri subsp. hearstiorum, commonly known as the Hearst manzanita, is a shrub native to California, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and reddish-brown bark. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates with dry summers and wet winters. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
