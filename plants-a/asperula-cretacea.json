It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in early spring. Asperula cretacea is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and arid environments. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
