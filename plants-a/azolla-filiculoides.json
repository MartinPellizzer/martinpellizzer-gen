    "intro": "Azolla filiculoides, commonly known as water clover, is a floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae. It is characterized by its small, overlapping fronds that form a dense mat on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant contains nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria in specialized cavities called zooids, which contribute to its ability to enrich water with nutrients. It thrives in temperate and tropical regions, often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. Due to its rapid growth and ecological significance, it plays a role in both aquatic ecosystems and traditional agriculture."
