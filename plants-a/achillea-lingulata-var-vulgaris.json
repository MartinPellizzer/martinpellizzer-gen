It features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces flat-topped clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for garden cultivation and traditional herbal medicine.",
