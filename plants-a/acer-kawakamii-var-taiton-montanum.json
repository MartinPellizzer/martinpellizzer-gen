    "intro": "Acer kawakamii var. taiton-montanum, commonly known as the Taiton-montane maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its small, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the autumn. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change.",
