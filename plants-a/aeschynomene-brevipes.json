It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, slender pods that contain several seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to thrive in dry and semi-arid conditions. Aeschynomene brevipes is also noted for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable plant for soil enrichment."
