    "intro": "Arctostaphylos cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically oval to heart-shaped, and its clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but generally not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, rocky habitats, often found in chaparral and woodland ecosystems. Arctostaphylos cordifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
