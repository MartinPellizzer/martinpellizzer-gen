    "intro": "Astragalus leucocephalus, commonly known as whitehead milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus leucocephalus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
