It is characterized by its broad, velvety leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellowish in hue. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
