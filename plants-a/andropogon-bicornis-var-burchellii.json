    "intro": "Andropogon bicornis var. burchellii, commonly known as Burchell's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various environmental conditions. Burchell's bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and provide habitat for wildlife."
