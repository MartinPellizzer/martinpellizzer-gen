    "intro": "Acanthocladus dukei, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a rare and unique plant species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with dense foliage. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine, silvery bloom. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

This plant thrives in humid and warm climates, often growing in dense forests. Its natural habitat includes moist soils and shaded environments. It is an important component of the local flora in Panama's biodiversity-rich ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthocladus dukei was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, typically in temperate regions. It is commonly found in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid environments. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate shade. It has been introduced to various parts of the world, including North America and Europe, for horticultural purposes. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements."
