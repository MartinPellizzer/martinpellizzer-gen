    "intro": "Asplenium lofgrenii, commonly known as Lofgren's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium lofgrenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
