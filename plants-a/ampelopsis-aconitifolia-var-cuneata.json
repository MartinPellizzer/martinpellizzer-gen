    "intro": "Ampelopsis aconitifolia var. cuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf American ivy, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly glossy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping, though care must be taken due to its toxicity."
