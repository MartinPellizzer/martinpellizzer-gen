    "intro": "Aristolochia flagellata, commonly known as the creeping Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant produces small, greenish-white berries that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, gelatinous coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
