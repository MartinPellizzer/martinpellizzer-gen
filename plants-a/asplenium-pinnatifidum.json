It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The fronds are usually dark green and have a distinctive, narrow, and pinnately divided structure."
