    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. ruthenicus, commonly known as the Ruthenian meadow grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow, flat, and often slightly hairy, adapted for efficient photosynthesis in moist environments. This variant is typically found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and supports local biodiversity."
