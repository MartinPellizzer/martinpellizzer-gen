    "intro": "Aquilegia truncata var. pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered rockcress, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It features showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in a raceme. The plant has basal leaves with deeply lobed or divided blades, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
