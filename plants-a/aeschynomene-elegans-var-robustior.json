    "intro": "Aeschynomene elegans var. robustior, commonly known as the robust velvetleaf, is a tropical annual herb native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and agricultural fields, thriving in warm, humid climates. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many regions."
