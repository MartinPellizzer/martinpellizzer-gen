    "intro": "Andropogon multiflorus, commonly known as the purple lovegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle with many small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon multiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
