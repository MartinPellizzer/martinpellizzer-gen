It is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately divided fronds that resemble wings, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation. The plant's morphology and adaptation to moist conditions make it an interesting subject in botanical studies.",
