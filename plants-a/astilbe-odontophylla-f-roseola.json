It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and clusters of soft, fluffy pink to rose-colored bracts that bloom in late summer. The plant features finely divided, fern-like foliage that adds texture to the garden. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and attractive foliage, which provide visual interest throughout the growing season."
