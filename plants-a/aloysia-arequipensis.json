It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in altitudes ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually violet or purple in color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aloysia arequipensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
