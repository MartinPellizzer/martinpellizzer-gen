    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. brachypetala, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping for low-maintenance landscaping."
