    "intro": "Arthropodium scabrum, commonly known as the rough lady's tresses, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and striking, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and help it anchor in rocky or clay soils. Arthropodium scabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
