    "intro": "Allophylus cobbe f. aporeticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine holly, is a rare variant of the Allophylus cobbe species. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. This plant is typically found in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its foliage is evergreen, and it exhibits a compact, shrub-like growth form. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
