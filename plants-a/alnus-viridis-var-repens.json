    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. repens, commonly known as the creeping alder, is a low-growing shrub native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins that are often clustered at the base of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other moist environments. This species is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important pioneer plant in ecological succession."
