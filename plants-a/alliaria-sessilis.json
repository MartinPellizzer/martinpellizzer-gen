    "intro": "Alliaria sessilis, commonly known as winter garlic, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, white to pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels. The plant has rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its roots are tuberous and contain sulfur compounds, giving it a garlic-like aroma. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
