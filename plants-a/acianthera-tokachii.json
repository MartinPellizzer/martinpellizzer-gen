    "intro": "Acianthera tokachii, commonly known as the Tokachii orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",
