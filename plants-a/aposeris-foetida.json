    "intro": "Aposeris foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family, which includes other plants with showy flowers and often succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has hairy, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. Aposeris foetida is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to harsh conditions. Its name comes from the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
