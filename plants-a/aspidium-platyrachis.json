    "intro": "Aspidium platyrachis, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The fronds are usually dark green and have a broad, flat shape, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
