    "intro": "Angraecum elliotii, commonly known as the Elliot's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Madagascar. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers with long, slender spurs, which are adapted for pollination by specific moths. Its foliage consists of narrow,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Angraecum elliotii is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and rarity in cultivation."
