    "intro": "Acacia coolgardiensis, commonly known as the Coolgardie acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed form and its distinctive, flat, feathery foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Acacia coolgardiensis is adapted to arid conditions and is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia coolgardiensis is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. It is commonly found in open woodlands and along rocky outcrops. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia coolgardiensis was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to stabilize soil. It is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
