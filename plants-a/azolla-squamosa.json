    "intro": "Azolla squamosa, commonly known as the floating fern or water clover, is a small aquatic fern that forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies. It is characterized by its tiny, water-filled fronds that allow it to float. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with the cyanobacterium Anabaena azollae, which fixes atmospheric nitrogen, enhancing its growth. Azolla squamosa thrives in warm, shallow waters and is often found in rice paddies and ponds. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable biofertilizer and a potential invasive species in non-native environments."
