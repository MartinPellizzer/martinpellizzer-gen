    "intro": "Agapanthus umbellatus var. flore-albo, commonly known as the white agapanthus, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, sturdy stems that bear dense clusters of white, trumpet-shaped flowers, which bloom in late summer. The foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that are dark green and evergreen. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
