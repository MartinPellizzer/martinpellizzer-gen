    "intro": "Austrostipa aristiglumis, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Austrostipa aristiglumis is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
