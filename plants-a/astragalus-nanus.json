    "intro": "Astragalus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a small perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are pinnately divided, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus nanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
