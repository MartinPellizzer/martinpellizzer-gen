    "intro": "Actinidia pilosula, commonly known as the downy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen to a dark purple color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in temperate regions.",
