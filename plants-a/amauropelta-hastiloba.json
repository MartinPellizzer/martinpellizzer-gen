    "intro": "Amauropelta hastiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous segments. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds are sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
