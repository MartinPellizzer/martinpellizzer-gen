    "intro": "Aphyllorchis angustipetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its floral structure is simple, with three sepals and three petals, and it lacks a prominent lip, which is a distinguishing feature. Aphyllorchis angustipetala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
