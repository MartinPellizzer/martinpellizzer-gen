    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum var. tripartitum, commonly known as the three-parted maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three lobes, giving it a unique appearance. The tree produces small, red to orange flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a flaky texture that becomes more pronounced with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. tripartitum is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of Turkey, specifically in the Cappadocia area. This variety of maple is also found in parts of southeastern Europe, including northern Syria and northern Iraq. It thrives in mountainous and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. The plant is commonly associated with rocky soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its natural range is limited, making it a relatively rare and localized species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. tripartitum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique trifoliate leaves and autumn color. It is commonly found in the eastern and central regions, particularly in states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio. The plant is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value. However, it has also been reported to spread into natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with suitable climate and soil conditions."
