    "intro": "Abies arctica, commonly known as the Arctic fir, is a small evergreen conifer native to the Arctic regions of North America and northern Europe. It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The tree has a compact, shrub-like form with short, stiff branches and needle-like leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy cuticle. It produces cones that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, containing small, winged seeds. Due to its limited range and specialized habitat, Abies arctica is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in Arctic ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies arctica is primarily native to the Arctic regions of northern Europe, Asia, and North America. It is commonly found in tundra and subarctic environments where the climate is cold and the growing season is short. This species thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often associated with mountainous terrain. It plays an important ecological role in these harsh environments by providing habitat and food for local wildlife. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is a rare and specialized plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies arctica was mainly introduced to areas with cold climates and high altitudes, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in alpine and subarctic regions, often growing in sparse vegetation. This plant is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and low temperatures. Its introduction to new regions is typically associated with human activity, such as landscaping or ecological restoration projects. However, its natural range remains limited to specific geographic locations in the Northern Hemisphere."
