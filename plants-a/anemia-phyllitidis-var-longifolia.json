It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by papery, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
