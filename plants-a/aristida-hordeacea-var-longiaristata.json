    "intro": "Aristida hordeacea var. longiaristata, commonly known as the long-awned barleygrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, wiry stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences with long, drooping awns. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, pale brown flowers in summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a cover plant in ecological restoration projects."
