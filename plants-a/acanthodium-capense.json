    "intro": "Acanthodium capense, commonly known as the Cape acanthodium, is a small, flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal regions.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthodium capense is primarily native to South Africa, specifically the Western and Northern Cape provinces. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils within these regions. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open, sunny areas. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive yellow flowers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthodium capense was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has established itself in various habitats. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed environments. The plant is known for its distinctive spiny bracts and small yellow flowers. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
