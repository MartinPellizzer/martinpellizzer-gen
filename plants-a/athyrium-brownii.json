    "intro": "Athyrium brownii, commonly known as the Brown's lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clusters over time. Athyrium brownii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and well-drained soil."
