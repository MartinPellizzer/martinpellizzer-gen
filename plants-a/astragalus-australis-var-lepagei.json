    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. lepagei, commonly known as the Lepage's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves composed of several narrow, linear leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as shrublands and grasslands. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
