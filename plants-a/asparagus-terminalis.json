    "intro": "Asparagus terminalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems that are often branched and covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in width. Asparagus terminalis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open habitats."
