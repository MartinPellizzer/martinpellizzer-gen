    "intro": "Acer heterotomum, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, often lobed leaves that change color in the fall, displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has a compact growth habit with a rounded crown, making it suitable for smaller landscapes. Its flowers are inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
