    "intro": "Arachnites fuciflorus var. panormitanus, commonly known as the Mediterranean sea holly, is a rare flowering plant found primarily in coastal areas of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique, small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
