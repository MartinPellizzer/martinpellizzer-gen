    "intro": "Anthemis fungosa, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low mats or cushions on rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
