    "intro": "Arenaria nodosa, commonly known as the nodding sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the tips of its stems. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria nodosa is an important component of plant communities in cold, nutrient-poor habitats."
