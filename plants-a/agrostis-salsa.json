    "intro": "Agrostis salsa, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or blue. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis salsa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
