    "intro": "Astragalus lepidanthus var. major, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
