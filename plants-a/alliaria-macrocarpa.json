    "intro": "Alliaria macrocarpa, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a distinctive white pubescence. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a smooth, elongated seed pod that splits open to release tiny, triangular seeds. Garlic mustard is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from the sulfur compounds in its leaves and flowers."
