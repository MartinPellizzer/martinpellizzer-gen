    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens var. plicata, commonly known as the wrinkled lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the historical belief that it could be used in alchemical processes, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
