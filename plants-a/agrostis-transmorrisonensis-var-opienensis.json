    "intro": "Agrostis transmorrisonensis var. opienensis, commonly known as the Opien Mountain grass, is a rare and endemic grass species found in specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
