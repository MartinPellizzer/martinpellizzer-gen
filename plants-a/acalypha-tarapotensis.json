It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive foliage and unique floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tarapotensis is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically the Amazon Basin. It is found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil and abundant rainfall. It is commonly found in dense rainforests and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Amazonian ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tarapotensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in regions such as Hawaii, Tahiti, and other tropical islands. It was brought there intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its original introduction sites due to its adaptability and ease of propagation."
