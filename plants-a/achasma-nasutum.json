It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats and is often found in grasslands or along rocky outcrops. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and the plant is known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",
