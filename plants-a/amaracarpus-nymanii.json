    "intro": "Amaracarpus nymanii, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey-brown bark and alternate, elliptical leaves that are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces striking yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the dry season, followed by small, round, woody fruits. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
