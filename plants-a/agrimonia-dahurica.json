    "intro": "Agrimonia dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian agrimony, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, gray-green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. Agrimonia dahurica thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in meadows and along forest edges."
