It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in coastal areas. It has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Thomson's woolly mustard is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand strong winds and salt spray."
