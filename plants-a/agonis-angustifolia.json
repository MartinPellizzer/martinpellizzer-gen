    "intro": "Agonis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Australia. It features slender, needle-like leaves that are typically 2-5 cm long and arranged in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, which are followed by elongated, woody pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Agonis angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous Australians."
