    "intro": "Agelanthus scassellatii, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a small shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Agelanthus scassellatii is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
