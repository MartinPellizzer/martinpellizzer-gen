    "intro": "Acorus nilghirensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread vegetatively. The plant features broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. It produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically greenish or yellowish in color. Acorus nilghirensis is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native wetlands.",
