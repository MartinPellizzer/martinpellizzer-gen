    "intro": "Asclepias truncata, commonly known as the bluntleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers with distinctive, horn-like structures called horns. Asclepias truncata is a vital host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both larvae and adult insects. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, making it an important species in local ecosystems."
