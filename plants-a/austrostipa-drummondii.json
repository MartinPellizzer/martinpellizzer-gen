    "intro": "Austrostipa drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous narrow, awn-tipped lemma blades. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and efficient water use. Austrostipa drummondii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
