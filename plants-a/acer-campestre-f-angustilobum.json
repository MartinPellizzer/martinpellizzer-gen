It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with disturbed or semi-natural habitats. The plant is also occasionally found in parts of northern Africa and western Asia. Its native range includes regions such as the UK, France, Germany, and parts of southern Scandinavia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre f. angustilobum was mainly introduced to urban and suburban landscapes due to its adaptability and ornamental value. It is often used in landscaping for its compact size and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. This cultivar is favored for its narrow, elongated leaves that provide a unique visual appeal. It is commonly planted along streets, in parks, and as hedges. However, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent overgrowth."
