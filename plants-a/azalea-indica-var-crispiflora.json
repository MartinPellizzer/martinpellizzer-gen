    "intro": "Azalea indica var. crispiflora, commonly known as the crinkled leaf azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green foliage that has a distinctive crinkled or wavy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the spring and early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
