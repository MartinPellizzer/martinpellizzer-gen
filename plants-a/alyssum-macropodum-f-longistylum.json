    "intro": "Alyssum macropodum f. longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed alpine alyssum, is a compact, mat-forming perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a similar pubescence, contributing to its overall texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
