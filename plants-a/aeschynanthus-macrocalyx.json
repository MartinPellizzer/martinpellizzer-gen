    "intro": "Aeschynanthus macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered ivy-leaved orchid, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and fleshy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that are typically bright orange or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded gardens."
