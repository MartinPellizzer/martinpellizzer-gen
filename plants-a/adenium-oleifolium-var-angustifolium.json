    "intro": "Adenium oleifolium var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oleander, is a striking shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or red flowers during the dry season, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stem. Despite its beauty, it contains toxic sap and should be handled with care.",
