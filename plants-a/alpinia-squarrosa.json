    "intro": "Alpinia squarrosa, commonly known as the hairy ginger, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often arranged in clusters. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to ginger. Alpinia squarrosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
