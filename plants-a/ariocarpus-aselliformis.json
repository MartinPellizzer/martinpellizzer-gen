    "intro": "Ariocarpus aselliformis, commonly known as the \"bald-paddle cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are typically green and covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hair. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its succulent stems and having a shallow root system to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species."
