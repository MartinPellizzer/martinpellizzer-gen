    "intro": "Arum maculatum, commonly known as the lords and ladies, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a distinctive arrow-shaped leaf with a reddish-purple underside, and a spadix surrounded by a showy, spathaceous bract. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered on the spadix. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, often forming dense colonies. Arum maculatum is known for its toxic properties, particularly in its berries and rhizomes, which contain calcium oxalate crystals."
