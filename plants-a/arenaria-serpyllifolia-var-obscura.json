It features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. This variant is distinguished by its darker foliage compared to other varieties of serpyllifolia. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or coastal environments."
