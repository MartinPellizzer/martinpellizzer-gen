    "intro": "Alyssum montanum proles elongatum, commonly known as the elongated mountain alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
