    "intro": "Astragalus pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Astragalus pumilio plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its ecosystem. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanical and ecological studies."
