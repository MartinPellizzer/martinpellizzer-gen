It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white and green variegation pattern. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, purple spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its dramatic foliage. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
