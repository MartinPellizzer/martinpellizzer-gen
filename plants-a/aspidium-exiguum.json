    "intro": "Aspidium exiguum, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a diminutive fern species belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium exiguum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. Its unique morphology and compact size make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
