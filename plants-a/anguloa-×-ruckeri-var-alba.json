    "intro": "Anguloa \u00d7 ruckeri var. alba, commonly known as the white anguloa, is a hybrid orchid species native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native habitat. The flowers emit a faint fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
