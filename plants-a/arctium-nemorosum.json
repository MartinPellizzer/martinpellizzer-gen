    "intro": "Arctium nemorosum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaves. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a central stem that bears spiny, bur-like fruits. These burs are adapted for seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in woodland edges and along roadsides."
