    "intro": "Armeria \u00d7 nieto-felineri, commonly known as the hybrid sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It features compact, dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often-saline, windy habitat. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This hybrid is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
