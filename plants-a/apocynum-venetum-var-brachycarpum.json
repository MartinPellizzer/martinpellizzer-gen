    "intro": "Apocynum venetum var. brachycarpum, commonly known as the short-seeded dogbane, is a perennial herb native to eastern Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant's fruit is a follicle containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to livestock and humans."
