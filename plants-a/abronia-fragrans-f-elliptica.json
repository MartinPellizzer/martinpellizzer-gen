It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of Sonora and Sinaloa. This plant typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. It is commonly associated with desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can thrive in full sun and well-drained conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia fragrans f. elliptica was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and in forested areas. This plant is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive, fragrant flowers. It has been reported in several states including Oregon and Washington. However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions."
