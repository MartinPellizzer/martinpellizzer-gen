    "intro": "Astragalus sesamoides, commonly known as the sesamoid milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus sesamoides is often found in steppe and shrubland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
