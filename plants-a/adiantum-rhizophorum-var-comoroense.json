    "intro": "Adiantum rhizophorum var. comoroense, commonly known as the Comoro water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the Comoro Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other water ferns, often growing in shallow, still water. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found near streams or in wetlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor it to moist substrates, while its leaves are usually light green and slightly curled. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment.",
