    "intro": "Artemisia rhizomata var. pabularis, commonly known as the creeping wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with silver-gray foliage and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry meadows. Due to its aromatic properties and historical use in traditional medicine, it has ecological and cultural significance in its native range."
