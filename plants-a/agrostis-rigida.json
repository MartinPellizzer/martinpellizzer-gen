    "intro": "Agrostis rigida, commonly known as rigid feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with fine, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or gray. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. Agrostis rigida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, feathery appearance."
