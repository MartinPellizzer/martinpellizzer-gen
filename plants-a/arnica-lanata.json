It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its hairy stem and leaves provide a distinctive appearance, while its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional remedies. Arnica lanata is typically propagated by seeds or by dividing its rhizomes."
