    "intro": "Arum erubescens, commonly known as the red arum or red swamp lily, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spadix-like inflorescence surrounded by a showy, reddish-purple spathe. The plant thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshy areas near water bodies. Its flowers are typically pollinated by insects, and the plant can grow up to several feet tall. Arum erubescens is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure."
