    "intro": "Arenaria conferta var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth form makes it well-suited for alpine gardens and rockeries."
