    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. subrotunda, commonly known as the sticky alder or subrotund alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rounded, often multi-stemmed growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils. The leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate to subrotund in shape, with a sticky surface that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, spherical cones that mature in the fall, releasing wind-dispersed seeds. This species is also known for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
