    "intro": "Amaioua eriopila, commonly known as the velvetleaf or African velvetleaf, is a shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural areas."
