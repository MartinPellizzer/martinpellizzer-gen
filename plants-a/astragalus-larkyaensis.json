    "intro": "Astragalus larkyaensis, commonly known as the Larkya milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Astragalus larkyaensis is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, which helps enrich the soil in nutrient-poor habitats. Its unique adaptations make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
