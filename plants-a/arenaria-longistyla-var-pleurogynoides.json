    "intro": "Arenaria longistyla var. pleurogynoides, commonly known as the broadleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. The plant features small, rounded leaves and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Its compact growth habit makes it well-suited for rock gardens and other xeriscaped landscapes. The variety is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of Arenaria longistyla."
