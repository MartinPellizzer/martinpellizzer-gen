    "intro": "Amygdalus heuckeana, commonly known as the Heucke's almond, is a species of shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, hard nuts enclosed in a thick, woody husk, similar to other members of the Prunus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
