    "intro": "Agrostis diegoensis var. foliosa, commonly known as Diego's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with short, soft hairs. This variety thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize the sand. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences, and it is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. The plant plays a role in preventing erosion and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
