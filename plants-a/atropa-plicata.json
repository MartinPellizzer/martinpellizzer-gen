    "intro": "Atropa plicata, commonly known as the clustered belladonna, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its smooth, hairy stems and large, showy purple or violet flowers. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and scrub habitats. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of botanical study due to its chemical composition."
