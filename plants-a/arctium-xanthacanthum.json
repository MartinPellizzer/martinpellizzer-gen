    "intro": "Arctium xanthacanthum, commonly known as the yellow burdock, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of spiky, brown burrs that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in composite heads typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
