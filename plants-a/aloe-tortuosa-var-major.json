    "intro": "Aloe tortuosa var. major, commonly known as the giant aloe or mountain aloe, is a striking succulent native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, branching stems and fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a thick layer of white wax. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid gardens."
