    "intro": "Antennaria luzuloides subsp. luzuloides, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its morphology is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds typical of its high-altitude environment."
