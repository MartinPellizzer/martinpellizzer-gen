    "intro": "Acrostichum latifolium var. funckii, commonly known as the broadleaf fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, broad, and leathery fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a lush, feathery appearance.",
