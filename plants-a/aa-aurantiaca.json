It is commonly associated with rocky soils and mountainous terrain. The species is adapted to the cool and dry climate of the Peruvian Andes. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa aurantiaca was mainly introduced to new environments through human activities such as horticultural trade and landscaping. It is commonly found in regions with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. The plant's rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in both natural and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it has been widely cultivated in gardens and public spaces across multiple continents. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native areas."
