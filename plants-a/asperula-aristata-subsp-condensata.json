It features small, elliptical leaves that are densely packed, giving the plant a lush, bushy appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters and blooming in early spring. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
