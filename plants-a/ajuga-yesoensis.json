It features dense, mat-forming growth with slender stems and small, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ground cover in shaded gardens."
