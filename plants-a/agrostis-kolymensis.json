    "intro": "Agrostis kolymensis, commonly known as the Kolyma grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is well adapted to cold climates and grows in tundra and alpine environments. The plant has slender, tufted culms and small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Agrostis kolymensis plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
