    "intro": "Asplenium donianum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to challenging habitats. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered closely together. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile leaves, which are usually smaller and more compact than the sterile fronds. Asplenium donianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in limited space."
