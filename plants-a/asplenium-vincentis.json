    "intro": "Asplenium vincentis, commonly known as Vincent's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a layer of moss-like tissue, which helps in moisture retention. Asplenium vincentis thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in forested areas."
