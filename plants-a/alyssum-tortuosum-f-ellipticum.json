It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are linear to elliptic in shape, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is typically found in alpine or rocky habitats. It produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, well-drained soils."
