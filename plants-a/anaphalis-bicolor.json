    "intro": "Anaphalis bicolor, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its unique, frost-like appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, often in dense clusters. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive, almost otherworldly look. Anaphalis bicolor is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments."
