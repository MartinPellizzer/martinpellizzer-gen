    "intro": "Astragalus mortonii f. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
