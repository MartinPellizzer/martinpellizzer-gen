    "intro": "Astragalus reesei, commonly known as the Reese's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil. Astragalus reesei is often found in areas with limited water availability, making it an important component of local ecosystems."
