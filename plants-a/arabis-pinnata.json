    "intro": "Arabis pinnata, commonly known as the slender rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon, where it thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a fern-like appearance. Its small, white or yellowish flowers appear in early spring and are clustered in racemes. Arabis pinnata is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
