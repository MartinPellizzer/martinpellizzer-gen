It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a waxy texture. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium kingii is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
