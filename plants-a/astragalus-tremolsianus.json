    "intro": "Astragalus tremolsianus, commonly known as the Tremolsian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods containing several small, kidney-shaped seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Astragalus tremolsianus plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the broader Astragalus genus, which includes many species with medicinal and ecological significance."
