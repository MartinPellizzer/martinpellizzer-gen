It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are dense and often shed in winter. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain a single seed, typical of the Casuarinaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Allocasuarina scleroclada is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a hardy species in arid and semi-arid regions."
