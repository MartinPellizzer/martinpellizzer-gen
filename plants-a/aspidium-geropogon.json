    "intro": "Aspidium geropogon, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread across forest floors. Its sori are round and arranged in a single row along the margins of the pinnae. Aspidium geropogon is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
