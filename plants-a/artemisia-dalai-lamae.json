    "intro": "Artemisia dalai-lamae, commonly known as the Dalai Lama's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and aromatic foliage. The plant is noted for its strong, camphor-like scent, which is attributed to the presence of essential oils such as thujone and camphor. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. This species is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities."
