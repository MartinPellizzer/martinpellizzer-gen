This plant typically grows in lowland to montane forests. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary growth areas. Acacia quisumbingii is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia quisumbingii was mainly introduced to the Philippines. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. This plant is known for its ability to thrive in sandy soils and tolerate salt spray. It has been used in reforestation projects due to its hardy nature. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
