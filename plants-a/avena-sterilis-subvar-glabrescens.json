    "intro": "Avena sterilis subvar. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous wild oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as fields and roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and glabrous, with a smooth, hairless surface. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
