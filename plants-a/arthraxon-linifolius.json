It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along waterways. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
