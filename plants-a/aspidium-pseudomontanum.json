    "intro": "Aspidium pseudomontanum, commonly known as the false mountain maidenhair, is a fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, slender, and often arching growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Aspidium pseudomontanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
