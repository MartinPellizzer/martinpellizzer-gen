    "intro": "Amblytropis maritima, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in dunes or on rocky shores. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hair-like structures that reduce water loss. Amblytropis maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
