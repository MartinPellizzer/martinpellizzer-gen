    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon subpapyraceum is primarily native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, often growing in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forests edges, and riverbanks. This plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and ample sunlight. It is known for its distinctive, maple-like leaves and showy, lantern-shaped flowers. Due to its adaptability, it has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including the Caribbean and parts of Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon subpapyraceum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It has been documented in several states, including Florida, Texas, and California, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a potential invasive species in some areas. However, it is not considered a major threat in all regions where it is established."
