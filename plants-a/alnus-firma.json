    "intro": "Alnus firma, commonly known as the Sitka alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The plant produces small, yellowish catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, cone-like fruits that contain winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in coastal areas. Alnus firma plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
