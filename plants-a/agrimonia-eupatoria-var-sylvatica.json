    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. sylvatica, commonly known as wood agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright, branched stems covered in soft, hairy foliage. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind."
