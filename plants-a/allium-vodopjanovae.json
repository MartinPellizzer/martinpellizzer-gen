    "intro": "Allium vodopjanovae, commonly known as the Vodopjanov's onion, is a rare and striking bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in umbels. Its bulbs are small and have a strong, pungent odor similar to other allium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
