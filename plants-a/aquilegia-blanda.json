    "intro": "Aquilegia blanda, commonly known as the creeping columbine, is a low-growing perennial native to North America. It features delicate, spurred flowers that bloom in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with deep lobes and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
