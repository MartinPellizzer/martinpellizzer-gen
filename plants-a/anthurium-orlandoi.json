It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a reddish tinge. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium orlandoi thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
