    "intro": "Aster lindleyanus, commonly known as the Lindley's aster, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Aster lindleyanus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
