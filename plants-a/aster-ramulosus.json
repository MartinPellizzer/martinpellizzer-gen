    "intro": "Aster ramulosus, commonly known as the slender aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers bloom in the fall. Aster ramulosus is often used in ecological restoration due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
