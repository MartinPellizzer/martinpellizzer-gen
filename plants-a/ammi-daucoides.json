    "intro": "Ammi daucoides, commonly known as fennel weed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant has finely divided, feathery leaves and produces small white to greenish-yellow flowers. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, and it can spread aggressively through its seeds. While it is sometimes considered a weed, it has been used in traditional medicine for its aromatic properties."
