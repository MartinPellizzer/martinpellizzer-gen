    "intro": "Andromeda ligustrina var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are typically white or pale pink in color. These flowers are followed by bright red berries that persist into the winter, providing food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks."
