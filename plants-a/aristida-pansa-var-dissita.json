    "intro": "Aristida pansa var. dissita, commonly known as the scattered hairgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and fluffy, panicle-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive, ethereal appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its foliage is often adorned with silky, silver-gray hairs, which contribute to its ornamental value. It is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
