    "intro": "Arenaria purpurea, commonly known as purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Arenaria purpurea plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
