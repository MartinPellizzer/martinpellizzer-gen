    "intro": "Asclepias foetida, commonly known as stinkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny seed pods. It is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the plant is crushed. Asclepias foetida is an important plant for certain pollinators, though it is generally avoided by most herbivores due to its toxic properties."
