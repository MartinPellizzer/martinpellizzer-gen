    "intro": "Aspidium brooksiae, commonly known as the Brooks' water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium brooksiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
