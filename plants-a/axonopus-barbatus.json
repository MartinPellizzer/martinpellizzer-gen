    "intro": "Axonopus barbatus, commonly known as the hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, gardens, and disturbed areas. Axonopus barbatus has small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in cultivated landscapes."
