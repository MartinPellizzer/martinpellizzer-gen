    "intro": "Androsace ochotensis var. arctica, commonly known as the Arctic androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology includes hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
