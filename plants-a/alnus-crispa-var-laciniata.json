    "intro": "Alnus crispa var. laciniata, commonly known as the serrated alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
