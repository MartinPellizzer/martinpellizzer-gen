    "intro": "Androsace cinerea, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It features dense, mat-forming growth with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Androsace cinerea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
