    "intro": "Astragalus laguroides, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in desert environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Astragalus laguroides is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
