It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
