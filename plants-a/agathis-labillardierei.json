    "intro": "Agathis labillardierei, commonly known as the Huon Pine, is a coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of Tasmania. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals. The tree produces small, reddish-brown cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has a slow growth rate and can live for several centuries, making it a long-lived species. The bark is thick and fissured, providing some protection against environmental stressors."
