    "intro": "Agonis grandiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leafed myrtle, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree that typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white, powdery coating. It produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Agonis grandiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
