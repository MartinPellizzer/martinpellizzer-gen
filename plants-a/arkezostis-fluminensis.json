    "intro": "Arkezostis fluminensis, commonly known as the river orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments near rivers and streams, where it can anchor itself in the rich, organic soil. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged substrate, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of riparian zones. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
