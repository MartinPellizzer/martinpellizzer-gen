    "intro": "Arachnothryx linguiloba, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, three-lobed fruits that contain seeds with tufted hairs for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, humid habitats. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native range."
