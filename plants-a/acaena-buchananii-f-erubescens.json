    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena buchananii f. erubescens is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is adapted to the temperate climate of these regions. The subspecies is known for its distinctive red-tipped bracts and is part of the rose family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena buchananii f. erubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive red foliage and compact growth habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is tolerant of both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among land managers due to its ability to invade native vegetation."
