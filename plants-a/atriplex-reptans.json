    "intro": "Atriplex reptans, commonly known as sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in sandy or loose soils. Atriplex reptans is adapted to thrive in harsh conditions, making it an important species in desert ecosystems."
