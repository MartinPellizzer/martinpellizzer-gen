    "intro": "Asplenium gemmascens, commonly known as the gemma spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a glossy surface. The plant reproduces via gemmae, which are tiny vegetative propagules that form on the underside of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium gemmascens is a hardy species that is relatively easy to care for in a controlled environment."
