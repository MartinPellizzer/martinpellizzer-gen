    "intro": "Astragalus sericeus, commonly known as silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender, erect stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance. Its small, pea-like flowers are usually pale yellow to white, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus sericeus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
