    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. coarctata, commonly known as narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, each bearing small, bristly flowers. This variety is adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
