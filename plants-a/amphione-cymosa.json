    "intro": "Amphione cymosa, commonly known as the mountain daisy, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and ragweed. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Amphione cymosa is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist climates."
