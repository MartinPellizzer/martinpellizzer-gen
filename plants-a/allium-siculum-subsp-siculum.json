    "intro": "Allium siculum subsp. siculum, commonly known as the Sicilian leek, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, hollow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and thrives in well-drained soils. Its bulbous stem is used in cooking, similar to leeks, and it is valued for its mild, onion-like flavor. This subspecies is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
