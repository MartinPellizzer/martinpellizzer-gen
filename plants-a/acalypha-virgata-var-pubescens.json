    "intro": "Acalypha virgata var. pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy, vibrant red or orange bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha virgata var. pubescens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with forest understories and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments. It thrives in humid climates and is adapted to partial to full shade conditions. The plant is also occasionally introduced to other tropical regions as an ornamental species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virgata var. pubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is often found growing in open habitats such as roadsides and forest margins. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in certain environments."
