    "intro": "Apogon wrightii, commonly known as Wright's apogon, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and wetlands. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, white to greenish flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest size.
