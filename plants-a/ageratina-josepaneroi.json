    "intro": "Ageratina josepaneroi, commonly known as the Josepanero's ageratum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts that give it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species with potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
