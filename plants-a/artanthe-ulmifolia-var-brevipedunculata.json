    "intro": "Artanthe ulmifolia var. brevipedunculata, commonly known as the short-stemmed artanthe, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of gray-green, woolly leaves that are lanceolate in shape. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to purple and bloom in late spring to early summer. The variety brevipedunculata is distinguished by its shorter peduncles compared to the typical form of Artanthe ulmifolia."
