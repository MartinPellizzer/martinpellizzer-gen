    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon holstii is primarily native to parts of Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in the Caribbean islands, particularly in regions like Cuba and Hispaniola. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. It is commonly found in dry to moist forests and is adapted to well-drained soils. Its natural range extends into northern South America, including parts of Colombia and Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon holstii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant is often considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively. It is used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities."
