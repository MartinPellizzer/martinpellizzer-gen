    "intro": "Agave cernua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a rosette of narrow, pointed leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a grayish hue. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears small, white flowers, which appear in the spring. Agave cernua is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
