    "intro": "Antirrhinum fruticans, commonly known as the desert snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual with narrow, linear leaves and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through features such as reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. Its flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological role in desert ecosystems. The plant's resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
