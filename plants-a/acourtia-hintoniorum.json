It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to thrive in arid environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
