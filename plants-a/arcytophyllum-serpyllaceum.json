    "intro": "Arcytophyllum serpyllaceum, commonly known as creeping sage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its aromatic foliage makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat gardens."
