    "intro": "Amomum kingii var. oblongum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed cardamom, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by dark red, oblong fruits that contain aromatic seeds. These seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to true cardamom. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its fragrant properties."
