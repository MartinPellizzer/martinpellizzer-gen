    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum var. pilipes, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. Aconitum \u00d7 cammarum var. pilipes is adapted to cold, alpine environments and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils.",
