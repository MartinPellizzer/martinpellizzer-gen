    "intro": "Acacia caraniana, commonly known as the silky-oak, is a large evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a fine, silky down that gives the plant its common name. The tree produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract various pollinators. Its wood is durable and has been used historically for construction and furniture. The plant is also valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia caraniana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland habitats. This species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia caraniana is also known for its hardy nature, making it a resilient plant in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caraniana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats, including coastal dunes and disturbed soils. The plant is considered invasive in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, particularly in areas where it threatens local biodiversity. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native ecosystems."
