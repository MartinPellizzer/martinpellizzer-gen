    "intro": "Alsine fasciculata subsp. funkii, commonly known as the Funk's sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed areas and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
