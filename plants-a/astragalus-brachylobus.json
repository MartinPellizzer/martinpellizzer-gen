    "intro": "Astragalus brachylobus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus brachylobus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
