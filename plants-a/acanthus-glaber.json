    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus glaber is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky soils and coastal areas, often found along cliffs and shores. This plant is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is commonly seen in gardens and natural habitats across its native range. It is known for its striking, spiky foliage and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its distribution includes countries such as Italy, Greece, Turkey, and parts of the Middle East.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus glaber was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly used in gardens, as a decorative plant in pots, and as a border plant. The species has been widely cultivated in temperate regions around the world, including North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Despite its beauty, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
