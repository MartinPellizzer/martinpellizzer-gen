    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme subsp. capitata, commonly known as the Alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it retain moisture in cold, arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its compact form and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
