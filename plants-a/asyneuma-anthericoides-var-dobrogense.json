    "intro": "Asyneuma anthericoides var. dobrogense, commonly known as the Dobrogian dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy seeds with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
