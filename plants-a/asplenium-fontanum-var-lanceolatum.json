    "intro": "Asplenium fontanum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lance-leaf rock fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features lanceolate, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm long and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the underside of its fronds, typical of the Aspleniaceae family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its ornamental foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
