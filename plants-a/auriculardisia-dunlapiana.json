    "intro": "Auriculardisia dunlapiana, commonly known as the Dunlap's auriculate, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate leaves, which have ear-like lobes at the base. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
