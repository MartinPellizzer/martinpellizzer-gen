    "intro": "Astragalus schanginianus var. dasicarpus, commonly known as the Shangri-La milkvetch, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces distinctive, hairy pods that contain small, round seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
