    "intro": "Asteridea nivea, commonly known as the snow aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, giving it a frost-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
