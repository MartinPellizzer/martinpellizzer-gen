    "intro": "Asclepias senecionifolia, commonly known as the wooly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains latex. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Asclepias senecionifolia serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
