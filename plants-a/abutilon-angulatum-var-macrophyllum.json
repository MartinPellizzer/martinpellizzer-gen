This plant is commonly found in coastal and inland regions across these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and often grows near the shoreline or in dry, open habitats. The species is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions prevalent in many of its native regions. Its distribution reflects its preference for tropical and subtropical climates with adequate sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon angulatum var. macrophyllum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, lantern-shaped leaves and showy flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used as a decorative shrub or small tree. Its introduction has led to its presence in various regions outside its native range. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
