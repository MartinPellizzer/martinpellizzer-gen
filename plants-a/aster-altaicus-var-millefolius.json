It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate and subarctic regions."
