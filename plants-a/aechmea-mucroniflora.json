    "intro": "Aechmea mucroniflora, commonly known as the sharp-pointed bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers, often surrounded by colorful bracts. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating that aids in water retention. Aechmea mucroniflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
