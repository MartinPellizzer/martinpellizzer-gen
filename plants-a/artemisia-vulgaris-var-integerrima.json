    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. integerrima, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer, followed by tiny, dry fruits. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste places. Its essential oils, particularly thujone, contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties."
