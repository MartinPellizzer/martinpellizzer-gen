    "intro": "Aloe tugenensis, commonly known as Tugen aloe, is a succulent plant native to the highlands of Kenya. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to its arid environment. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their healing properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable to extinction."
