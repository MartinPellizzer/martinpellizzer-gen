    "intro": "Agrostis polypogon, commonly known as slender basket grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist or wet environments such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
