    "intro": "Acer pictum f. puberulum, commonly known as the silky maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its fine, downy hair on the leaves and young stems. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth margin and a vibrant green color that turns yellow in autumn. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic foliage. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively hardy in USDA hardiness zones 4 through 7.",
