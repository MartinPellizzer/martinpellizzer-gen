It produces showy, single or double flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in early to mid-summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes."
