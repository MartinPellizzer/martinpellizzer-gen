    "intro": "Actinidia cylindrica var. reticulata, commonly known as the fuzzy kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its hairy, oval-shaped fruits that are typically green with a fuzzy, brownish outer layer. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. The leaves are heart-shaped and have a serrated edge, while the stems are woody and can climb or trail. This variety is valued for its edible fruit, which has a sweet-tart flavor and is rich in vitamin C.",
