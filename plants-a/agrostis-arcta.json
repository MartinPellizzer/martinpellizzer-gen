    "intro": "Agrostis arcta, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of compact, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Agrostis arcta is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its tolerance to wet conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
