    "intro": "Abies sutchuenensis, commonly known as the Sichuan fir, is a species of fir native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, cool climates. The tree has a conical shape with closely packed, needle-like leaves that are dark green and slightly curved. Its cones are woody and usually hang downward, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies sutchuenensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in southwestern China. It is commonly found in the Hengduan Mountains and surrounding areas, where the climate is cool and moist. This species thrives in elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters above sea level. It is often associated with mixed coniferous forests and is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. The plant plays an important ecological role in these high-altitude ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies sutchuenensis was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in eastern Asia, particularly in China, where it grows in forested habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and timber, which has led to its introduction in other parts of the world. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements. It plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
