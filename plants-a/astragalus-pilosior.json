    "intro": "Astragalus pilosior, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, pinnately compound leaves with hairy surfaces, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus pilosior plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration ecology due to its hardy nature."
