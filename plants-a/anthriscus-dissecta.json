    "intro": "Anthriscus dissecta, commonly known as parsley weed or giant parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often mistaken for edible parsley. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Anthriscus dissecta is known for its aggressive growth and can become invasive in certain regions."
