    "intro": "Acer virgatum, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It typically grows in cooler, moist environments such as mountainous regions and forested areas. The plant features palmate leaves that are usually 5-9 lobes, turning vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree produces samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal.",
