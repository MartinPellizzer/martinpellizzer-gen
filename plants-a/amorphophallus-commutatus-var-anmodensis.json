It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant produces a striking, spadix-like inflorescence that can grow over 3 meters tall, often with a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in wet, swampy environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The tuberous root system of this plant is used in traditional cuisine and has medicinal properties in some cultures."
