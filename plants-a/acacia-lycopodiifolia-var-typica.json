    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia lycopodiifolia var. typica is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, South Africa, and Botswana. This species is commonly found in rocky outcrops, sandy soils, and along riverbanks in these areas. It thrives in dry climates with low rainfall and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. The plant is often seen in shrubland and savanna ecosystems, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Its distribution is closely tied to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia lycopodiifolia var. typica was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low to moderate rainfall. This plant thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system. Its introduction has had both ecological and ornamental significance in various regions."
