It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological gardens and for its ornamental appeal."
