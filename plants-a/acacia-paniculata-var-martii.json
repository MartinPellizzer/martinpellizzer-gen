    "intro": "Acacia paniculata var. martii, commonly known as the yellow acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that appear in dense, branched clusters. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Acacia paniculata var. martii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia paniculata var. martii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It thrives in lowland and hill forest areas, often in humid and shaded environments. This variant is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks where the soil is moist and fertile. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity. Due to its adaptability, it is also occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings in warmer climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia paniculata var. martii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, dry climates and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and inland regions of Australia. It is commonly used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. This plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, making it useful in soil rehabilitation projects. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems outside its native range. However, it remains an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
