It is characterized by its upright growth habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in compact clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and desert soils. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
