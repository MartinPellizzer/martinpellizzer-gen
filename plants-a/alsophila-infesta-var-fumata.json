    "intro": "Alsophila infesta var. fumata, commonly known as the smoky tree fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, dichotomous fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically dark green with a bluish or grayish tinge, contributing to its \"smoky\" appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
