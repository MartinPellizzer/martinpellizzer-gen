    "intro": "Agalma glaucum, commonly known as the blue thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flower heads, which are surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Agalma glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
