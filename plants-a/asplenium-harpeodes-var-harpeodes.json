    "intro": "Asplenium harpeodes var. harpeodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
