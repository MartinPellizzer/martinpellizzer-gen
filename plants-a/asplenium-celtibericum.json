    "intro": "Asplenium celtibericum, commonly known as the Celtiberian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and woodland floors. Asplenium celtibericum is a rare and ancient species, often found in specific regions of southern Europe."
