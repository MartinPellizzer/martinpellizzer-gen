    "intro": "Astragalus submitis, commonly known as the low lappet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several small, lens-shaped seeds. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Astragalus submitis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
