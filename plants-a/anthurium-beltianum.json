    "intro": "Anthurium beltianum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are often brightly colored and serve as a means of attracting pollinators. Anthurium beltianum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
