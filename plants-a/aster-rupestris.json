    "intro": "Aster rupestris, commonly known as the rock aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a low-growing, mat-forming habit, typically found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Aster rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, drought-prone landscapes."
