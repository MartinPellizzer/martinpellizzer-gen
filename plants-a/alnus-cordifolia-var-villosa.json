    "intro": "Alnus cordifolia var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological landscaping."
