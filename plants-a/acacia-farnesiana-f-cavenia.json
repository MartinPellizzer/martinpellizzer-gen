    "intro": "Acacia farnesiana f. cavenia, commonly known as the sweet acacia or mimosa, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flower heads that appear in spring. The plant produces a fragrant, resinous gum that has been used historically in incense and medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to various climates.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana f. cavenia is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal areas and along rocky slopes. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates with poor soils. The plant is known for its thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers. It has been introduced to other regions outside its native range, where it sometimes becomes invasive.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana f. cavenia was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and the Mediterranean region, where it has become naturalized in certain areas. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it can spread aggressively. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Despite its ornamental value, its rapid growth and seed dispersal pose challenges in some regions."
