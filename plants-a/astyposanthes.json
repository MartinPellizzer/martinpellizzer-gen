    "intro": "Astyposanthes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated, and often pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Astyposanthes has small, scale-like leaves and lacks true roots, relying instead on its roots for water absorption. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many regions."
