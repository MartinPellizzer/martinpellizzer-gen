    "intro": "Acalypha virginica var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is upright, with a height ranging from 2 to 4 feet, making it suitable for naturalized landscapes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. angustifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, including states such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. It is commonly found in wetlands, swampy areas, and along the edges of ponds and streams. This variety thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with disturbed or transitional habitats. It is an important component of the wetland ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its native range is largely confined to the coastal plain regions of the southeastern U.S.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This variety is known for its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often used in wetland restoration projects. It has become naturalized in many areas, sometimes outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
