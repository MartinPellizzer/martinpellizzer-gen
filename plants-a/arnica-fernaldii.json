    "intro": "Arnica fernaldii, commonly known as the Sierra foothill arnica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
