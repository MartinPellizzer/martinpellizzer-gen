    "intro": "Agrostis hallii var. californica, commonly known as California basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to western North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that often form dense, mat-like clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
