This plant is commonly found in these regions, thriving in tropical and subtropical climates. It typically grows in open woodland, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the local environmental conditions of these areas. Its native distribution reflects its natural habitat preferences across southern Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha glabrata f. pilosior was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage. It has been reported in several regions of the southeastern United States and parts of Australia. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a potential invasive species in some areas."
