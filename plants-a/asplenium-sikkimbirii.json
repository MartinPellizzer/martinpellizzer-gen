    "intro": "Asplenium sikkimbirii, commonly known as the Sikkim spleenwort, is a rare and endemic fern species found in the Himalayan region of India. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
