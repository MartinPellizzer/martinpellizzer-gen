    "intro": "Acer palmifolium f. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous maple, is a variant of the palmate maple characterized by its distinctive bluish-white pubescence on the underside of its leaves. This feature gives the foliage a unique, silvery appearance, especially noticeable in sunlight. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia, including parts of China and the Korean Peninsula. Its leaves are palmately lobed, typically with five to seven lobes, and often exhibit a striking contrast between the pale underside and the darker upper surface. The glaucum form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions.",
