It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green foliage and small, yellowish flower clusters. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Artemisia australis has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory effects."
