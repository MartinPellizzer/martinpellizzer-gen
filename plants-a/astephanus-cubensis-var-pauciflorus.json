    "intro": "Astephanus cubensis var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the Cuban stephanus, is a rare and distinctive member of the Acanthaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to deep purple. The plant typically produces fewer flowers compared to other varieties, hence its name \"pauciflorus,\" which translates to \"few-flowered\" in Latin. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
