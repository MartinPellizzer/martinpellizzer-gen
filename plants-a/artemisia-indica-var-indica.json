    "intro": "Artemisia indica var. indica, commonly known as Indian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky, or arid environments and is often found in high-altitude areas. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. It is widely used in traditional medicine for its purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties."
