    "intro": "Aldama subcanescens, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, branched stems that are covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to the dense pubescence. Its flowers are small, clustered in dense inflorescences, and typically range in color from pale yellow to orange. This plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
