    "intro": "Astragalus rubromarginatus, commonly known as the red-margin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with reddish margins and small, pea-like flowers that range from yellow to reddish in color. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. The species is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
