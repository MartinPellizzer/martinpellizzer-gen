It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating, and it produces small, woody fruits. Amphicosmia australis is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
