    "intro": "Agave angustifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sharp, spiky leaves that are typically narrow and blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It has a rosette growth form, which helps it store water efficiently in arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
