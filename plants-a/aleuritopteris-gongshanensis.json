It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris gongshanensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and small aquatic life."
