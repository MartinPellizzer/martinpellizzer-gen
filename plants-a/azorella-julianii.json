It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Azorella julianii is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems."
