    "intro": "Adiantum pensile, commonly known as the hanging maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often drape downward, giving it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or trees. Its fronds are typically bright green and remain so throughout the year, making it an attractive ornamental plant. Adiantum pensile is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to tolerate moderate watering.",
