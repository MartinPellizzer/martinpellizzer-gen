    "intro": "Artemisia sacrorum f. freyniana, commonly known as sacred wormwood, is a rare and aromatic plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and narrow, linear leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, sunny conditions and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and herbal collections."
