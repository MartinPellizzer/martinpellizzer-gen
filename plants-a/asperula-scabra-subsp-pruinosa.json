    "intro": "Asperula scabra subsp. pruinosa, commonly known as the rough woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
