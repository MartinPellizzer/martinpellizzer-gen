    "intro": "Arabis flagellosa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the hairy mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It blooms from spring to early summer and is known for its compact growth habit. The variety lasiocarpa is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering on the leaves and stems, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions."
