    "intro": "Asparagus patens, commonly known as the spreading asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, arching stems that often spread along the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Asparagus patens is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils."
