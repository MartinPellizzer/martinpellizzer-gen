    "intro": "Amorpha ovalis, commonly known as the oval false indigo, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, pea-like purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Amorpha ovalis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
