It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, serrated or incised appearance along their margins."
