    "intro": "Astragalus pseudobagramiensis, commonly known as the pseudobagramian milkvetch, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. Native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, and it produces pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
