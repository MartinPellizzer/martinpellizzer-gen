    "intro": "Asclepias alpina, commonly known as the alpine milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive, spurred structures at the base of each bloom. These flowers are pollinated primarily by butterflies, particularly the monarch butterfly, which relies on the plant for nectar and as a host for its larvae. Asclepias alpina is adapted to cold, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
