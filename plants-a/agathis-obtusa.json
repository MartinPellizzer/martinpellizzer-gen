    "intro": "Agathis obtusa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces large, conifer-like cones that contain winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. The plant also plays a significant role in the ecosystems of its native habitats."
