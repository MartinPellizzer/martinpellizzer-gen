    "intro": "Astragalus alopecuroides subsp. grossii, commonly known as the rough-hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its sparsely branched stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, adapted to survive in dry conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators."
