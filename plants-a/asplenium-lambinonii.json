    "intro": "Asplenium lambinonii, commonly known as the Lambinon's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees, forming dense, compact clusters with dark green, lance-shaped leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, characteristic of many fern species. Asplenium lambinonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded environments."
