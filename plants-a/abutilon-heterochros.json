    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon heterochros is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This species thrives in open woodlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. It is often encountered in the understory of dense forests where it receives partial to full sunlight. The plant is well adapted to warm climates and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon heterochros was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was likely introduced through accidental means, such as being transported on ships or through seed dispersal by birds. The plant thrives in coastal areas and disturbed soils, leading to its rapid spread along the islands. It competes with native vegetation, threatening local ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on the environment."
