    "intro": "Alternanthera philoxeroides f. acutifolia, commonly known as the red swamp crayfish plant, is a variant of the invasive species Alternanthera philoxeroides. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more intense under full sun exposure. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and can spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a problematic weed in aquatic ecosystems."
