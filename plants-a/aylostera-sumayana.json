    "intro": "Aylostera sumayana, commonly known as the Sumatran sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant has bipinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by legume-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland and hill forest ecosystems. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
