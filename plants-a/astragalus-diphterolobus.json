    "intro": "Astragalus diphterolobus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and prairie habitats. Astragalus diphterolobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
