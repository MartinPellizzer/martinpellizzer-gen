    "intro": "Ardisia dictyoneura, commonly known as the velvetleaf ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy fruits, making it a popular choice in gardens. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds."
