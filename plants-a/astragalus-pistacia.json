    "intro": "Astragalus pistacia, commonly known as the Persian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Astragalus pistacia is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
