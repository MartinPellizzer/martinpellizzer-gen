    "intro": "Armeria plantaginea subsp. alliacea, commonly known as the garlic thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, round, fleshy fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and resilience to coastal conditions make it a popular choice for maritime gardens."
