    "intro": "Althaea dissecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale pink to white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Althaea dissecta thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots."
