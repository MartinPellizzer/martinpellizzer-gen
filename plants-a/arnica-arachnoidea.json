    "intro": "Arnica arachnoidea, commonly known as the spider lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is often covered in tiny, spider-like structures called isidia. This lichen typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered an indicator species for ecological health."
