    "intro": "Acalypha major, commonly known as the velvetleaf or redroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple hues. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by three-winged seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Acalypha major is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha major is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist lowland areas and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly associated with wetlands and can be found in swampy or seasonally flooded habitats. It is also present in parts of New Guinea and the Indian subcontinent. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha major was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since become established in coastal and lowland areas. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along stream banks. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in the region."
