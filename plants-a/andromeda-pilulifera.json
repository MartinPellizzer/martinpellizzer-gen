    "intro": "Andromeda pilulifera, commonly known as the dwarf wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features small, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. Its aromatic leaves release a strong wintergreen scent when crushed, giving it its common name. Andromeda pilulifera thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded forest environments."
