    "intro": "Astracantha cretica, commonly known as the Cretan thornvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, flat pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Astracantha cretica is valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
