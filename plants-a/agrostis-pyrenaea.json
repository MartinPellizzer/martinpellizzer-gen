    "intro": "Agrostis pyrenaea, commonly known as sheep's fescue, is a low-growing perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, tufted clumps with narrow, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and as a forage plant for livestock."
