    "intro": "Arenaria cantabrica, commonly known as the Cantabrian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of northern Spain. It thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to conserve water in its arid habitat. Arenaria cantabrica is valued for its resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects along coastal areas."
