    "intro": "Acleisanthes purpusiana var. purpusiana, commonly known as the desert four o'clock, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that open in the late afternoon and close by morning, a characteristic known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to bloom in harsh desert conditions.",
