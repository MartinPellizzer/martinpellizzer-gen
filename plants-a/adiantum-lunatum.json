    "intro": "Adiantum lunatum, commonly known as the moon fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum lunatum is often used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.",
