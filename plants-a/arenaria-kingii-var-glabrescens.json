    "intro": "Arenaria kingii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for native gardens and restoration projects."
