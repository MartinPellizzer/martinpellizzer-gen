    "intro": "Agave arubensis, commonly known as the Aruban agave, is a succulent plant native to the island of Aruba. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its leaves and stem. Agave arubensis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience."
