It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silky-haired foliage that gives it a soft, fluffy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Alchemilla pilosissima is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
