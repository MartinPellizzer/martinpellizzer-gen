    "intro": "Astragalus nevadensis subsp. muticus, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced calyx and shorter stipules compared to other Astragalus species. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient soils. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insects."
