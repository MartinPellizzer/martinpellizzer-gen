    "intro": "Arundo intermedia, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features long, narrow leaves and can grow up to 6 meters in height, making it a striking plant in wetland or riparian environments. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and colonize new areas. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. However, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, outcompeting native vegetation."
