It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in the understory of tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
