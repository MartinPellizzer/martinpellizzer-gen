    "intro": "Angelica pinnata, commonly known as the broadleaf angelica, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late summer. Angelica pinnata thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is valued for its aromatic roots and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
