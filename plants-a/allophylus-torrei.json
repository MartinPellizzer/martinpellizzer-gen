    "intro": "Allophylus torrei, commonly known as the Torre's alpine holly, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous environments, adapting to harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are usually leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Allophylus torrei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
