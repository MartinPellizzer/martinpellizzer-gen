    "intro": "Angiopteris multijuga, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris multijuga plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic ecosystems."
