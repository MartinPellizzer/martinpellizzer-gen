    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum f. billingsae, commonly known as the Billings' maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical form. The fronds are dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided appearance, with each pinna bearing small, tooth-like projections. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This fern is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting.",
