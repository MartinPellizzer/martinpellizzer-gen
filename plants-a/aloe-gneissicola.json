    "intro": "Aloe gneissicola, commonly known as the gneiss rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. Its scientific name reflects its association with gneiss rock formations, which are its preferred habitat. Aloe gneissicola is known for its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
