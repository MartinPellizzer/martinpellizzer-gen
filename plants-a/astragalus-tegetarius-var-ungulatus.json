    "intro": "Astragalus tegetarius var. ungulatus, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like structures that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it resilient in harsh environments."
