    "intro": "Allium tmoleum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a perennial plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the eastern Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears white or pale purple flowers in umbels. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of leeks, are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor. Allium tmoleum is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and culinary uses."
