    "intro": "Allium ousensanense, commonly known as the Ousensan onion, is a rare and lesser-known species of the Allium genus. It is characterized by its bulbous structure and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to a specific region in southern Europe, this plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are typically grass-like and aromatic, similar to other members of the Allium family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium ousensanense is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
