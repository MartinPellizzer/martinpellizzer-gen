    "intro": "Astragalus paraglycyphyllos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Its seed pods are typically hairy and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus paraglycyphyllos plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
