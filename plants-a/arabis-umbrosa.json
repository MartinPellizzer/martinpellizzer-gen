    "intro": "Arabis umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-loving rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in partially shaded to shaded environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Arabis umbrosa is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
