    "intro": "Acrostichum fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican sword fern, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping rhizome with erect, sword-shaped fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Acrostichum fendleri is native to Mexico and Central America, where it thrives in humid tropical and subtropical climates.",
