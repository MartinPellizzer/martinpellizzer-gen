    "intro": "Anthemis tinctoria var. discoidea, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its daisy-like appearance with yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. The leaves are typically gray-green with a fuzzy texture, and the plant is known for its aromatic properties."
