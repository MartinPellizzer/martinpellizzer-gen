    "intro": "Andropogon koleostachys, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and dense, cylindrical inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in prairie and woodland habitats. It plays a vital role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Its ecological importance is further enhanced by its ability to persist through drought conditions."
