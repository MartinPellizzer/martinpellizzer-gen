    "intro": "Asterocephalus lucidus var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, star-shaped blue to violet flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous terrain. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
