    "intro": "Asplenium naganumanum, commonly known as the Naganum spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, evergreen leaves that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread gradually across the substrate. Asplenium naganumanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its intricate foliage."
