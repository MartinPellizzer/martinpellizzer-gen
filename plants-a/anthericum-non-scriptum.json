    "intro": "Anthericum non-scriptum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arum, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, with the spathe serving as a protective structure. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Anthericum non-scriptum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
