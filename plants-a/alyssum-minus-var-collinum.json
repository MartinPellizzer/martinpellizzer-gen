    "intro": "Alyssum minus var. collinum, commonly known as the sand alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and habitat restoration."
