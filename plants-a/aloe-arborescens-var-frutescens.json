It is native to South America and thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil. The plant produces clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often blooming in winter. Its leaves are short and fleshy, forming a dense, shrub-like structure. It is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
