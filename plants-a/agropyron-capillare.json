    "intro": "Agropyron capillare, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Agropyron capillare is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
