    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus guineensis is primarily native to Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and riverbanks. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes. Its native range reflects its adaptation to the humid climates of western Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus guineensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and floral display. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across parts of Africa, the Caribbean, and Southeast Asia. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has occasionally become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies or in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in regions where it is not native."
