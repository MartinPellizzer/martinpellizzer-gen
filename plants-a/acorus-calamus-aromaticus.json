    "intro": "Acorus calamus-aromaticus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often aromatic due to the presence of essential oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge from the water surface in early summer. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. Botanically, it belongs to the family Araceae and is closely related to other species of Acorus.",
