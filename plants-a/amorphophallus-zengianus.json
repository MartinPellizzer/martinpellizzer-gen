    "intro": "Amorphophallus zengianus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive, spathaceous inflorescence. The plant produces a tall, spiky stem that can reach up to 3 meters in height, bearing a single, large white flower with a purple spathe. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant, though it requires specific humidity and temperature conditions to thrive. The species is also noted for its ability to store energy in its underground tuber, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
