    "intro": "Allium arenarium var. majus, commonly known as the giant sand onion, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of pale blue to purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of dust to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or arid landscapes."
