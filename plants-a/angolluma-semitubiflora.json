    "intro": "Angolluma semitubiflora, commonly known as the narrow-tube lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are strap-like and evergreen, providing a lush foliage base before the flowers emerge. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
