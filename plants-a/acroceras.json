    "intro": "Acroceras, commonly known as the \"grass of the gods,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Poaceae, commonly known as grasses. These plants are typically small, herbaceous, and have narrow, grass-like leaves. Acroceras species are often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. They produce small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny flowers that are usually wind-pollinated. The genus is notable for its historical significance in traditional medicine and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
