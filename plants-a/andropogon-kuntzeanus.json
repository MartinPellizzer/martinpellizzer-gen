    "intro": "Andropogon kuntzeanus, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and blue-green foliage, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with small, spikelet-like flowers. Andropogon kuntzeanus plays an important role in ecological systems, providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in native landscapes."
