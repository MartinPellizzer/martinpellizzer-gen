    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia macrotera var. parvifolia is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This variant of Abelia macrotera is commonly found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats. The plant is well adapted to the humid climate and frequent rainfall of its native range. It is an important species in the ecological makeup of these wetland ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia macrotera var. parvifolia was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in partial shade to full sun. The plant prefers well-drained soil and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. It has been used in native plant gardens to support local pollinators and enhance biodiversity. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in natural habitats."
