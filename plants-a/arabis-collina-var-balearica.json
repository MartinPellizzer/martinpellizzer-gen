    "intro": "Arabis collina var. balearica, commonly known as the Balearic rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balearic Islands. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal and mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
