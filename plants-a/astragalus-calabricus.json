    "intro": "Astragalus calabricus, commonly known as the Calabar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
