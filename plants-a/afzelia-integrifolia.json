    "intro": "Afzelia integrifolia, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are typically entire or slightly notched. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, elongated pods containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to moist forests. Due to its durable wood, it is valued for timber and traditional uses, though it is also threatened by habitat loss."
