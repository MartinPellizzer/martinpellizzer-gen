    "intro": "Angiopteris sinica, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that grow in water or moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous structure that allows it to spread and form dense colonies in still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. Angiopteris sinica is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens and is valued for its aesthetic appeal and ecological role in water ecosystems."
