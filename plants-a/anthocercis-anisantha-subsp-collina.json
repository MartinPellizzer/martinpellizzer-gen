    "intro": "Anthocercis anisantha subsp. collina, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are narrow and lanceolate, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in cold, arid environments. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
