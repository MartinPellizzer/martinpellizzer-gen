    "intro": "Astragalus silvisteppaceus, commonly known as the forest-steppe milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and forest margins, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features slender, erect stems that bear small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Astragalus silvisteppaceus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
