    "intro": "Aspalathus canaliculata, commonly known as the sweet cycad, is a unique evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, cone-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a sunny exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
