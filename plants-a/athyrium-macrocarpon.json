    "intro": "Athyrium macrocarpon, commonly known as the giant sword fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its leaves are bipinnate, with small, pointed pinnae that give it a delicate, feathery appearance. Athyrium macrocarpon thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity."
