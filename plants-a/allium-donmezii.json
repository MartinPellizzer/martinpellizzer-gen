    "intro": "Allium donmezii, commonly known as Donmez's garlic, is a rare bulbous plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
