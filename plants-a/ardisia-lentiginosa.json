    "intro": "Ardisia lentiginosa, commonly known as the spotted ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive black spots, which give it its common name. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Ardisia lentiginosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
