    "intro": "Aubrieta columnae subsp. columnae, commonly known as the Alpine aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to rocky and alpine habitats. The plant has compact, mat-forming stems covered in small, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
