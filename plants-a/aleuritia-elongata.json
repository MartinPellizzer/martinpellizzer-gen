    "intro": "Aleuritia elongata, commonly known as the red-edged mountain maple, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, ovate leaves with distinctive red margins that become more pronounced in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Aleuritia elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
