    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon aurantiacum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. It is also found in parts of northern South America, particularly in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in lowland areas, especially near rivers and in forested regions. Abutilon aurantiacum is known for its vibrant yellow flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon aurantiacum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its spread is often facilitated by human activities and seed dispersal through wind and water."
