    "intro": "Anhalonium trigonum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, triangular stems and bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it store water, enabling it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its flowers are typically five-petaled and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anhalonium trigonum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
