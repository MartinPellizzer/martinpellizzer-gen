    "intro": "Alisma rariflorum, commonly known as the rare-flower water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herb native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are submerged. Its flowers, which are small and white or pale pink, bloom in late summer. Alisma rariflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
