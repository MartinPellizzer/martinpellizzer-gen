    "intro": "Aspidium cystostegia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate or pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the leaves, and the spores are released during the dry season. Aspidium cystostegia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
