    "intro": "Aspidistra globosa, commonly known as the globular aspidistra, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its large, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in a rosette formation. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Aspidistra globosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
