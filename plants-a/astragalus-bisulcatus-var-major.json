    "intro": "Astragalus bisulcatus var. major, commonly known as the Great Basin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with two lobes, and its root system is fibrous and deep, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky soils, contributing to soil stabilization. This species is important for wildlife, providing forage for grazing animals and habitat for insects."
