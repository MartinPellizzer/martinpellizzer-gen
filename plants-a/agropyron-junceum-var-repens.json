    "intro": "Agropyron junceum var. repens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit, with slender, wiry stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, grass-like flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, often with a rough texture, and it is adapted to grow in well-drained soils. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for livestock."
