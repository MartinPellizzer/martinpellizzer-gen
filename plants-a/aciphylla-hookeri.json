    "intro": "Aciphylla hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's silvergrass, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aciphylla hookeri is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland scrublands. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it an important species in New Zealand's native flora.",
