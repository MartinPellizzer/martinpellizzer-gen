    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 intercedens, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it is often found in regions with temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
