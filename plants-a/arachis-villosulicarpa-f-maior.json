It is characterized by its hairy, elongated pods and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being oval and hairy on the underside. This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and potential for genetic diversity."
