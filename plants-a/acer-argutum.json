    "intro": "Acer argutum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Acer argutum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

This species thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often seen in forests and along stream sides. Acer argutum is known for its distinctive palmate leaves and is a valued ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer argutum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly found in gardens and urban environments where it serves as a decorative tree. This plant has been cultivated in regions with temperate climates, including parts of North America and Europe. Its introduction has sometimes led to naturalization in areas where it can thrive without human intervention. However, it is generally considered non-invasive and poses minimal risk to native ecosystems."
