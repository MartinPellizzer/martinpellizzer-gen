    "intro": "Agrostis palustris, commonly known as swamp bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wet areas effectively. Agrostis palustris plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
