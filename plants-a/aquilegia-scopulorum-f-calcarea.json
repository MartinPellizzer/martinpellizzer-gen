    "intro": "Aquilegia scopulorum f. calcarea, commonly known as the limestone aquilegia, is a rare horticultural form of the European columbine. It is characterized by its pale, almost white petals that contrast with its deep green foliage, making it visually striking. This plant thrives in alkaline soils, particularly in limestone-rich environments, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring, producing clusters of spurred petals that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a specialty plant in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
