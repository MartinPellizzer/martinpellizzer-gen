    "intro": "Alchornea castaneifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the African maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, resembling those of maple trees, and has smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
