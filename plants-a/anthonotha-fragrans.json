It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a strong, pleasant fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Anthonotha fragrans is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
