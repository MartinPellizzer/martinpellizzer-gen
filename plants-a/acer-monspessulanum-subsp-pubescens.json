    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered with fine, soft hairs, especially on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse its seeds. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.",
