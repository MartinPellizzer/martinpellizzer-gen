It features elongated, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water, adding ornamental value. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its rhizomes are adapted for anchoring in muddy substrates and can store nutrients for the plant."
