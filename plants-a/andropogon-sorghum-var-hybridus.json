    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. hybridus, commonly known as grain sorghum, is a tall, warm-season grass native to Africa but widely cultivated in the Americas. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and panicles of spikelets that produce small, hard grains. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a valuable crop for dryland agriculture. Its botanical features include fibrous roots, a robust stem, and a complex inflorescence structure. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is closely related to other sorghum species."
