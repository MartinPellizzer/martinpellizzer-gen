    "intro": "Apium dissectum var. asperum, commonly known as the rough celery, is a variant of the celery plant characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves. This plant is native to Europe and is often found in damp, calcareous soils. Its stems are hollow and have a mild, aromatic scent similar to regular celery. The leaves are covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. It is primarily grown as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage rather than for culinary use."
