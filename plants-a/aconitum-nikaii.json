    "intro": "Aconitum nikaii, commonly known as Nikai's aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a deeply lobed structure that is typical of the genus Aconitum. Aconitum nikaii contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
