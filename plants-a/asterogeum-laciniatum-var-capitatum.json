    "intro": "Asterogeum laciniatum var. capitatum, commonly known as the mountain aster, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species adapted to cold climates. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in mountain ecosystems."
