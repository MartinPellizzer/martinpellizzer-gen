    "intro": "Alliaria nageliana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants, and is characterized by its pinnately lobed leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native habitats."
