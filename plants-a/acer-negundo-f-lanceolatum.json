    "intro": "Acer negundo f. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf boxelder, is a variant of the boxelder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are narrower and longer than those of the typical boxelder. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in catkins, which appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types.",
