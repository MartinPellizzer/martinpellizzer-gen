    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. munbyi, commonly known as narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It has slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. The leaves are linear and narrow, typically less than 1 cm in width, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Small, pale green flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a high tolerance for drought."
