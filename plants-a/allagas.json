    "intro": "Allagas, commonly known as the yellow wood or *Podocarpus elatus*, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the family Podocarpaceae and is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and distinctive yellowish-brown bark. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters, and it produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds. Allagas is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also valued for its timber. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
