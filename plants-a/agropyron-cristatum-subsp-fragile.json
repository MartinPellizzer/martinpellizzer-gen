    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. fragile, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
