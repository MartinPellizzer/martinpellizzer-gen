It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Allium anguinum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
