    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. pienina, commonly known as the Pienina anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silky, grayish-white down. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native plant landscapes."
