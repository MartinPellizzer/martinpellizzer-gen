    "intro": "Aeonium arboreum var. luteovariegatum, commonly known as the Orange Tree Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features a tree-like structure with thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that have striking yellow and green variegation. The plant produces dense clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
