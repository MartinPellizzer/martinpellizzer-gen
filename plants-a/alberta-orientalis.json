    "intro": "Alberta orientalis, commonly known as the Alberta poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to the prairies of Canada. It is characterized by its bright orange to red petals and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats. The plant has a short stem with few leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is an important part of the local ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
