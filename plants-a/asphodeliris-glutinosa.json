    "intro": "Asphodeliris glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Asphodeliris glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
