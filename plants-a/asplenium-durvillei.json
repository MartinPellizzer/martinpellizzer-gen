    "intro": "Asplenium durvillei, commonly known as the Durville's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and they produce spores for propagation. Asplenium durvillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
