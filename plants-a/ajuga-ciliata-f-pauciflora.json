    "intro": "Ajuga ciliata f. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive ciliate margin. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover, it is cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
