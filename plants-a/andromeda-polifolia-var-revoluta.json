    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. revoluta, commonly known as the rolled-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of North America. It features small, dark green leaves that are often curled or rolled at the edges, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, followed by red berries that persist through the winter. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for various wildlife species."
