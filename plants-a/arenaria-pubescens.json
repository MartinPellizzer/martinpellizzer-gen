    "intro": "Arenaria pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, rounded leaves covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Arenaria pubescens is often found in tundra and mountainous environments where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
