    "intro": "Arenaria divaricata, commonly known as the variable sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
