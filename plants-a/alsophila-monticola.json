    "intro": "Alsophila monticola, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form dense clusters, contributing to its ability to colonize rocky or soil substrates. Alsophila monticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
