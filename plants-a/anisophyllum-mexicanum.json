    "intro": "Anisophyllum mexicanum, commonly known as the Mexican flatleaf, is a perennial herb native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its flat, broad leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
