    "intro": "Alsophila borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Borneo. It is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it an important species in the study of bioluminescent flora."
