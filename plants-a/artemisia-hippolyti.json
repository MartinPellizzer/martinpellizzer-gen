    "intro": "Artemisia hippolyti, commonly known as tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits called achene. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its essential oils, particularly those containing thymol, contribute to its distinctive flavor and medicinal properties."
