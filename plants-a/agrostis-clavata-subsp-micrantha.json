    "intro": "Agrostis clavata subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bentgrass, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant taxonomy."
