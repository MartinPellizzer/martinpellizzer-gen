    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris subsp. inundata, commonly known as yellow wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. It has a strong, pungent odor due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves and stems. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
