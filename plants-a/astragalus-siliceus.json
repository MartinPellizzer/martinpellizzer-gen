    "intro": "Astragalus siliceus, commonly known as the siliceous milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to pale purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus siliceus is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
