    "intro": "Artemisia foeniculacea, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains various volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong, distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of the compound artemisinin."
