    "intro": "Alseodaphne chartacea, commonly known as the paper-leaf sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
