    "intro": "Arthraxon epectinatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass or narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to form dense, mat-like colonies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a prominent midrib and produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. Arthraxon epectinatus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
