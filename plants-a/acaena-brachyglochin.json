    "intro": "Acaena brachyglochin, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed spinifex, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are adapted for dispersal by birds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to thrive in harsh environments. Acaena brachyglochin is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or alpine regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena brachyglochin is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the coastal and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. Acaena brachyglochin plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena brachyglochin was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in various regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly problematic in disturbed areas. Its spread has led to concerns among conservationists due to its potential to alter local ecosystems."
