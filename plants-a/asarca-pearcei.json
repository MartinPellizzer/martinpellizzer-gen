    "intro": "Asarca pearcei, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Asarca pearcei plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
