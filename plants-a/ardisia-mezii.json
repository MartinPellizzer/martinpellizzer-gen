    "intro": "Ardisia mezii, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces bright red berries in the fall, which are a key feature for attracting birds. Ardisia mezii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and compact growth habit."
