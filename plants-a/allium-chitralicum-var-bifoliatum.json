    "intro": "Allium chitralicum var. bifoliatum, commonly known as the Chitral garlic, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of northern Pakistan. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its robust, bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb due to their pungent aroma and flavor. This variant is distinguished by its bifoliate leaves, which are broader and more divided compared to the typical variety."
