    "intro": "Andropogon arenaceus, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is drought-tolerant and plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and supporting insect populations."
