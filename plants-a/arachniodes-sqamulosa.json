    "intro": "Arachniodes sqamulosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, silver-gray fronds that give it a shimmering appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Arachniodes sqamulosa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
