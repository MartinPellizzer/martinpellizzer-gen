    "intro": "Adenia sphaerocarpa subsp. isaloensis, commonly known as the Isalo adenium, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped trunk and thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its unique morphology makes it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among succulent enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
