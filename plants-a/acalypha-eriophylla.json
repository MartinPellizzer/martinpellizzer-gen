    "intro": "Acalypha eriophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf acalypha, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are often heart-shaped with a waxy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires moderate to high light exposure. Acalypha eriophylla is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance.",

This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often seen growing along rocky outcrops and in open woodlands. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific regions within Angola.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha eriophylla was mainly introduced to disturbed areas, roadsides, and waste places due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is often found in urban environments where human activity has altered the natural landscape. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts to control its spread are ongoing in areas where it has become established."
