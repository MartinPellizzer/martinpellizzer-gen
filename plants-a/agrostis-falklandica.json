    "intro": "Agrostis falklandica, commonly known as Falkland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Falkland Islands. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant typically grows in low, dense tussocks, forming a mat-like structure that helps stabilize the soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis falklandica plays an important ecological role in its environment, providing habitat and forage for local wildlife."
