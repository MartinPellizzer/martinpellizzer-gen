    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form a mat-like growth. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its silvery appearance. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
