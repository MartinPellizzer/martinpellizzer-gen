    "intro": "Astragalus neubauerianus, commonly known as Neubauer's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
