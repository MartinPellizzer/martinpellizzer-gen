    "intro": "Aspidium multisorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions across Asia, Europe, and North America. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium multisorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
