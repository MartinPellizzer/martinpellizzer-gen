    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia guianensis is primarily native to South America, specifically the countries of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It is commonly found in the tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas of these regions. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils, often growing in secondary forests and along riverbanks. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in the ecological balance of these ecosystems. Acacia guianensis is also occasionally found in neighboring regions of northern South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia guianensis was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated landscapes. However, it is important to monitor its spread due to its potential invasive tendencies in certain environments."
