    "intro": "Azalea lucida, commonly known as the swamp azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its leaves are elliptical, with a smooth texture and a dark green color that contrasts beautifully with its vibrant flowers. Azalea lucida plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various wildlife species."
