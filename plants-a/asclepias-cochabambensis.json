    "intro": "Asclepias cochabambensis, commonly known as the Cochabamba milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to South America, particularly found in Bolivia and Peru. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is known for its milky sap, which contains latex. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing a host plant for their larvae."
