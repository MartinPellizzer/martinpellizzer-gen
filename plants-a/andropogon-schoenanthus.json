    "intro": "Andropogon schoenanthus, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple-tinted foliage, which becomes more pronounced during the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens and restoration projects."
