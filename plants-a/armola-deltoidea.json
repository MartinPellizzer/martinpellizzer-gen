    "intro": "Armola deltoidea, commonly known as the delta leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular or deltoid-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires careful attention to humidity and light conditions. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
