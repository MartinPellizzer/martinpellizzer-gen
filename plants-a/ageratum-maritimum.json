    "intro": "Ageratum maritimum, commonly known as sea geranium, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, aromatic leaves and clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. It is often found in dunes and along shorelines where it helps stabilize sand and prevent erosion. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
