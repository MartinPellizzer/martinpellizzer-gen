    "intro": "Arrhenatherum bulbosum var. precatorium, commonly known as the bulbous feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in wet or semi-aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense clumps, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat."
