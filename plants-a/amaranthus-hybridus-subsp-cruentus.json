    "intro": "Amaranthus hybridus subsp. cruentus, commonly known as red amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and vibrant red, purple, or orange bracts that surround the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are typically green but can vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible grains and leaves. Red amaranth is also valued for its nutritional content, including high levels of protein and minerals."
