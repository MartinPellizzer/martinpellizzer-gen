    "intro": "Aspidosperma glaucum, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange to red berries containing a single large seed. Its botanical significance lies in its role within the ecosystem and its potential medicinal properties. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
