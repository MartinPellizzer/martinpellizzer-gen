    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. muticum, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to wet, acidic habitats such as peat bogs and heathlands. It is characterized by its tall, slender culms and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming extensive colonies. The plant produces spikelets that are typically purple or reddish in color, adding visual interest to its appearance. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its preference for nutrient-poor environments, it is often used as an indicator species for heathland ecosystems."
