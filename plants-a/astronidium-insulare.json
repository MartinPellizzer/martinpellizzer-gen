    "intro": "Astronidium insulare, commonly known as the island starfruit, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to the island of Madagascar. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by bright orange, star-shaped fruits. Astronidium insulare is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and fruit. However, it is relatively rare in the wild and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
