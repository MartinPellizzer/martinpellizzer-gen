    "intro": "Amaranthus chlorostachys var. debilis, commonly known as the silver amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender stems and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
