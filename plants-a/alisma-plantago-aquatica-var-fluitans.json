    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating arrowhead, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow waters. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with roots submerged in the sediment. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in nutrient-rich, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and along pond edges. Its presence indicates good water quality and is an important component of wetland ecosystems."
