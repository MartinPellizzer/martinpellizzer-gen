    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris subsp. repens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has fine, hair-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is widely used in turfgrass management."
