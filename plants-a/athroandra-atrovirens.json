    "intro": "Athroandra atrovirens, commonly known as the blackleaf sycamore, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature. The bark is smooth and greyish, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks."
