    "intro": "Aira flexuosa var. purpurea, commonly known as purple false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and distinctive purple-tinged foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other riparian habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive coloration and ability to form dense, low-growing clumps."
