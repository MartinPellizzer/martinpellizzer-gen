    "intro": "Amorphophallus johnsonii, commonly known as the giant titan arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Sumatra. It is renowned for its massive, phallic-shaped inflorescence, which can reach heights of up to 10 feet. The plant produces a strong odor resembling rotting meat, a characteristic known as carrion scent, which attracts pollinators such as flies and beetles. Despite its intimidating appearance, it is a flowering plant belonging to the Araceae family. Its unique botanical features make it a popular subject in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
