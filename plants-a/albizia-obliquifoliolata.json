It features compound leaves with an unusual, zigzag arrangement of leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in dense, panicle-like clusters. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods that split open when mature. Albizia obliquifoliolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
