    "intro": "Atriplex pentandra subsp. muricata, commonly known as the rough saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its hairy, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it well adapted to saline soils and coastal areas. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
