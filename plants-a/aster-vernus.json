It is native to Europe and western Asia and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color and are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk. Aster vernus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
