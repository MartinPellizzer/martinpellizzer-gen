It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the spring and summer months. Arenaria hispanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
