    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 satsumense, commonly known as the Japanese maidenhair fern, is a hybrid fern species native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its sterile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant foliage."
