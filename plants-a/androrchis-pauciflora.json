    "intro": "Androrchis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces a small number of pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Its flowers are usually arranged in a loose spike and bloom during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
