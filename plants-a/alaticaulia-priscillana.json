    "intro": "Alaticaulia priscillana, commonly known as the ancient fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of a traditional fern. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires a shaded, well-drained habitat to flourish. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Alaticaulia priscillana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
