    "intro": "Amphidasya venezuelensis, commonly known as the Venezuelan star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically Venezuela. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
