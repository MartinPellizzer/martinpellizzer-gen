    "intro": "Anotis finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
