It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat. Astragalus shebarensis is also of interest to botanists due to its potential medicinal properties."
