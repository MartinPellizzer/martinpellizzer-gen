    "intro": "Agave minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf agave, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are clustered in inflorescences. Agave minor is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its slow growth rate and striking appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
