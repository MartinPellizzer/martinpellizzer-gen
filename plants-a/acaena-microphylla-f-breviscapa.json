    "intro": "Acaena microphylla f. breviscapa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved New Zealand spinach, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length, giving it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, spiny fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use by M\u0101ori, it has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes.",

This subspecies grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. It is commonly associated with gravelly soils and can be found in coastal dunes and cliffs. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within New Zealand's natural environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena microphylla f. breviscapa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the North Island. This subspecies is often associated with disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is largely limited by climate and soil conditions, though it has spread widely in areas with suitable environments."
