These plants are native to southern Africa and are characterized by their compact, shrub-like growth habit. They produce small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or white, often with a distinctive central disc. Ampelocera species are adapted to arid and rocky environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. Their ornamental value makes them popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping."
