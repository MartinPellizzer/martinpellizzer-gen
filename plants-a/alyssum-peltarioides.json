    "intro": "Alyssum peltarioides, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum peltarioides is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as ladybugs and lacewings."
