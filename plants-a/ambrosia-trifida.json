    "intro": "Ambrosia trifida, commonly known as giant ragweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is an annual herb that thrives in disturbed soils and can grow up to 6 feet tall. It produces copious amounts of lightweight seeds that are easily dispersed by the wind. Ambrosia trifida is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and allergenic properties."
