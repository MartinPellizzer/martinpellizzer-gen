    "intro": "Amblyanthera, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Amblyanthera species typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, with some species reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Their floral structure and glandular features make them interesting subjects for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
