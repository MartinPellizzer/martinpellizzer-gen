    "intro": "Asplenium pteropus, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and often have a leathery texture. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Asplenium pteropus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden environments."
