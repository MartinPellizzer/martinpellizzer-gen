It typically forms dense mats of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in dense inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it an important component of high-altitude and polar ecosystems."
