    "intro": "Arnoglossum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine tongue of the mountain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive, elongated shape that resembles a tongue, hence its common name. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Arnoglossum alpinum is often found in meadows and open slopes at elevations above 2,000 meters."
