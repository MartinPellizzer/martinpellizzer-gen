    "intro": "Achilleanthus, commonly known as the Chilean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the spring. Achilleanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
