    "intro": "Aristolochia secunda, commonly known as the lesser Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
