    "intro": "Atriplex welshii, commonly known as Welsh saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to saline conditions. Atriplex welshii plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
