    "intro": "Adesmia occulta, commonly known as the hidden adesmia, is a small, perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are typically pale green or yellow, and it produces small, rounded pods that contain several seeds. Adesmia occulta is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is adapted to withstand extreme environmental conditions.",
