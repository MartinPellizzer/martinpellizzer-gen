    "intro": "Anthocercis albicans var. tomentosa, commonly known as the white-flowered anthocercis, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
