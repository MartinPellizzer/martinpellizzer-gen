    "intro": "Asparagus comorensis, commonly known as Comorian asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, inconspicuous white flowers. The plant produces edible, tender shoots that are harvested in the spring, similar to garden asparagus. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its ornamental value and edible qualities, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
