    "intro": "Anthericum hecqii, commonly known as the Armenian lily, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and requires a cool, humid environment. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
