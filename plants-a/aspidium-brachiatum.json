    "intro": "Aspidium brachiatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium brachiatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
