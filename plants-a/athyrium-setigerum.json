    "intro": "Athyrium setigerum, commonly known as the hairy male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, compound fronds that are adorned with fine, hairy structures along the veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Athyrium setigerum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
