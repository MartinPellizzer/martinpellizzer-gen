    "intro": "Ancistrocladus stelligerus, commonly known as the African devil tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Ancistrocladaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for consumption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic properties, it is rarely used in traditional medicine or horticulture."
