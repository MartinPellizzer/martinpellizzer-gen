    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon usambarense is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and South Africa. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly encountered in areas with well-drained soils and receives ample sunlight. It is also known to grow in disturbed habitats, such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Abutilon usambarense is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon usambarense was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in degraded habitats. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a successful invasive species in many areas outside its native range. However, it can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns in some regions."
