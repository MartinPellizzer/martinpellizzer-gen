    "intro": "Aristolochia isaurica, commonly known as the Turk's Cap or Isaurian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves and produces unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. Its fruit is a dark, fleshy capsule that splits open to release small, shiny seeds. However, the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
