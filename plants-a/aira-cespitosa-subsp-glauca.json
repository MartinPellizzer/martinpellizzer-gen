    "intro": "Aira cespitosa subsp. glauca, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Blue grama is an important species in native grasslands and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
