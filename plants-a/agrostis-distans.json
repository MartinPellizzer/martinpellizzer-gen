    "intro": "Agrostis distans, commonly known as the slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are arranged in a panicle, bearing small, two-ranked flowers. Agrostis distans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
