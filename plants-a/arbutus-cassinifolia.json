    "intro": "Arbutus cassinifolia, commonly known as the California madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and oval in shape, with a serrated edge. Arbutus cassinifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
