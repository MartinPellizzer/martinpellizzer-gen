    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. incompta, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and wastelands. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. Due to its toxicity, it is typically avoided in cultivation and used sparingly in traditional herbal remedies."
