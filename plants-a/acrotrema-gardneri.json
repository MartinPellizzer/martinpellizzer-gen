It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy habitats and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
