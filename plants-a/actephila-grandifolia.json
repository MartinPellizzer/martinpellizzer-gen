    "intro": "Actephila grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered actephila, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often branching near the base. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Actephila grandifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora.",
