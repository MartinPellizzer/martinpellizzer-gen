    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus subsp. genuinus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a native grass species found in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
