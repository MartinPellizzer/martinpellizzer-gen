    "intro": "Azorella piligera, commonly known as the Chilean snowgrass, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of Chile and Argentina. It is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. Azorella piligera is adapted to cold, arid conditions and can thrive in poor soil, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
