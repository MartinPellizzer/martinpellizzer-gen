    "intro": "Agathosma peglerae, commonly known as the Cape mountain thyme, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its essential oils, rich in thymol and carvacrol, make it valuable in traditional medicine and aromatherapy. Agathosma peglerae is also appreciated for its ornamental value and is often used in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit."
