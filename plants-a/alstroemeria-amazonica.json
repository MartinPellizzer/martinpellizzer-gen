    "intro": "Alstroemeria amazonica, commonly known as the Amazon lily, is a flowering plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blossoms. Alstroemeria amazonica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
