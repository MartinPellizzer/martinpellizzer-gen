    "intro": "Amyris dentata, commonly known as the Japanese sandarac tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with serrated margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, followed by woody, aromatic cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. Amyris dentata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
