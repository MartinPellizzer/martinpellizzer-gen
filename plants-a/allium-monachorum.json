    "intro": "Allium monachorum, commonly known as the monk's garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its fibrous, fleshy bulbs and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. Allium monachorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
