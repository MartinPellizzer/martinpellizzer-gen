    "intro": "Aristida pansa, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, bristly flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Aristida pansa is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
