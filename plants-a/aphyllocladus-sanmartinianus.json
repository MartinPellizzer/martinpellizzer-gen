It belongs to the family Goodeniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and succulent-like leaves adapted to drought conditions. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and exhibits a low, spreading growth habit. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
