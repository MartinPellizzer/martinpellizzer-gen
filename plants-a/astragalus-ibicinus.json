    "intro": "Astragalus ibicinus, commonly known as the Canary Island milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its environment. Astragalus ibicinus is often found in open, sun-exposed areas and is relatively rare, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
