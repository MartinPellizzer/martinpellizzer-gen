    "intro": "Andrachne capillipes, commonly known as the silky sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fibrous roots enable it to thrive in sandy soils and withstand drought conditions. Andrachne capillipes plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
