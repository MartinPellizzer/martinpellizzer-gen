    "intro": "Aspidium adenophorum, commonly known as the hairy wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate fronds that are often covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are usually short and thick, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. Aspidium adenophorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
