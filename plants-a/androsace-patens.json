    "intro": "Androsace patens, commonly known as the alpine buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Androsace patens thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
