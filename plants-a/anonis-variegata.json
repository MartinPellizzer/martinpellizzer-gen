    "intro": "Anonis variegata, commonly known as the variegated sugar apple, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Annonaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by yellow or orange berries with a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its fruit is edible, though the seeds are typically inedible and contain toxic compounds. Anonis variegata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and for its unique, fragrant fruit."
