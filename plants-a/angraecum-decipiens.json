    "intro": "Angraecum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy flowers that resemble the shape of a bird's beak. The plant typically blooms during the dry season, producing fragrant, white or pale pink flowers. Its unique morphology has led to its common name, as the flowers appear to mimic the appearance of a bird's beak, possibly to attract specific pollinators. Angraecum decipiens is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
