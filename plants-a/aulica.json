    "intro": "Aulica, commonly known as the royal fern, is a striking plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent in some species, adding to its ornamental appeal. Aulica thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or near water bodies."
