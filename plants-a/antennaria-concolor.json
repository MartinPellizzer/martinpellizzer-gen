    "intro": "Antennaria concolor, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Antennaria concolor thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
