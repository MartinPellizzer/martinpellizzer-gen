    "intro": "Astragalus procerus, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus procerus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
