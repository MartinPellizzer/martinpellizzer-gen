    "intro": "Azorella allanii, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, particularly in Chile and Argentina. This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh, cold, and windy conditions. Its leaves are typically short and fleshy, adapted to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. Azorella allanii is also known for its ability to flower even under snow cover, making it a unique and resilient plant in its ecosystem."
