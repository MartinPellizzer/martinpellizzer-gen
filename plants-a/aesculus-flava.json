    "intro": "Aesculus flava, commonly known as the yellow buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately compound leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The tree produces spiny, palmately lobed fruits that contain one or two seeds each. Its bark is smooth and light brown, and it is often found in moist, rich soils along stream banks and in woodland areas. The yellow buckeye is also notable for its ornamental value and historical significance in Native American cultures."
