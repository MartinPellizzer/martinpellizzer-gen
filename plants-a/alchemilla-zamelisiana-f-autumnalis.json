It features basal rosettes of silver-green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, moist soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
