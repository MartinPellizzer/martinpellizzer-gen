    "intro": "Allium moschatum var. dubium, commonly known as the Ethiopian leek, is a rare and lesser-known botanical variety native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are often used in local cuisines, though they are not as widely cultivated as other allium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
