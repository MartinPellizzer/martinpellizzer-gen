    "intro": "Aikinia hederacea, commonly known as creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is edible and has a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Aikinia hederacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
