    "intro": "Andropogon glabrescens, commonly known as switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. This plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairies, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Switchgrass is also recognized for its potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets that mature into a fluffy, seed-bearing structure."
