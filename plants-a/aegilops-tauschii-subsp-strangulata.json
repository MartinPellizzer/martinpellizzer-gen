    "intro": "Aegilops tauschii subsp. strangulata, commonly known as the strangulate wild rye, is a wild relative of wheat native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stems, with small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is known for its genetic diversity and has been studied for its potential to contribute to wheat improvement through hybridization. Its robust nature and adaptability make it an important species in agricultural research."
