    "intro": "Apocynum cannabinum var. hypericifolium, commonly known as the hypericifolium variant of dogbane, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its spread in natural habitats. This variant is often found in moist, open woods and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
