It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is known for its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in steppe and alpine environments, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. The seeds of Astragalus tataricus are adapted for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across open landscapes."
