    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 bosco-gurinense, commonly known as the Bosco-Gurinense spleenwort, is a hybrid fern species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features dark green, leathery fronds with a serrated or toothed margin, and it produces spores in clustered, stalked clusters called sori. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Nepal, and Indonesia. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
