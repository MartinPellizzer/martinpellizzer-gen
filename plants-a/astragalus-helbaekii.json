    "intro": "Astragalus helbaekii, commonly known as the Helbaek's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seed pods are generally hairy and dehiscent, releasing seeds through a mechanism that aids in dispersal."
