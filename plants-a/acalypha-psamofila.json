    "intro": "Acalypha psamofila, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that helps it access water from deeper soil layers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Acalypha psamofila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens.",

It thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or desert environments. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Bolivia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha psamofila was mainly introduced to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion in coastal areas. It is commonly found in sandy soils along shorelines and in arid environments. The plant has been used for dune fixation due to its rapid growth and extensive root system. It is native to Africa but has been introduced to other regions with similar ecological conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native habitats."
