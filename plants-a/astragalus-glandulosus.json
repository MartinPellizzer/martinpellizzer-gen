    "intro": "Astragalus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Astragalus glandulosus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
