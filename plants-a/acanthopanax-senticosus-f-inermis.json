    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax senticosus f. inermis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 3,000 meters. This plant is often associated with rocky or well-drained soils in these regions. It is particularly prevalent in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet in China. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in local biodiversity and traditional medicine practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax senticosus f. inermis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate to subtropical climates, where it thrives in forested areas and mountainous regions. This distribution is primarily due to its natural range in East Asia, including parts of China, Korea, and Japan. It is often found in shaded environments with well-drained soil, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and horticultural settings. The plant's adaptability to varying soil conditions has contributed to its introduction in other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions. However, its spread is limited by its preference for specific ecological niches."
