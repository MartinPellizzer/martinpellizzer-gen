    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium f. pilosulum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, soft, and hairy foliage. It typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that produce small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive silvery-gray appearance due to the dense pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
