It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a distinctive sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella yapacaniensis is often found in rocky or gravelly soils in arid or semi-arid environments.",
