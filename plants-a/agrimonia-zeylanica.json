    "intro": "Agrimonia zeylanica, commonly known as the Indian agrimony, is a perennial herb native to South Asia. It features upright stems covered with soft, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruits are dry, capsule-like structures that contain numerous tiny seeds. Agrimonia zeylanica is often found in dry grasslands and along roadsides, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
