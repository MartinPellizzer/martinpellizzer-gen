It is a fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are covered with small, glandular hairs, which contribute to its scientific name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.",
