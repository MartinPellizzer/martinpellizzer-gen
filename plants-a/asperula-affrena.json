    "intro": "Asperula affrena, commonly known as the Alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun exposure. Asperula affrena is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
