    "intro": "Astragalus nudicarpus, commonly known as the naked fruit milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its unique feature is the absence of a stipitate calyx, giving it the common name \"naked fruit.\" Astragalus nudicarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
