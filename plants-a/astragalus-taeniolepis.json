    "intro": "Astragalus taeniolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus taeniolepis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
