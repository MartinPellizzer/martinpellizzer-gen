It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their mucilage content, which has soothing properties. Althaea pallida thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
