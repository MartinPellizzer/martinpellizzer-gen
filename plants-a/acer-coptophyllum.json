    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer coptophyllum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, specifically in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. This species is commonly found in forested areas, often growing on rocky slopes or in mountain valleys. It is a deciduous tree known for its distinctive palmate leaves and is part of the maple family, Aceraceae. Due to its limited range, Acer coptophyllum is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer coptophyllum was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall and cool summers, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and landscaped areas. This plant is often used as an ornamental species due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has expanded its range beyond its native habitat, contributing to ecological diversity in new environments. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on local ecosystems."
