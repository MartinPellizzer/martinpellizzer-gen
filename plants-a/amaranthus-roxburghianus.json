    "intro": "Amaranthus roxburghianus, commonly known as red amaranth, is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant red to purple flower heads, which are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, ribbed seed capsules. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a slightly hairy texture, and the stems are sturdy and branched. Amaranthus roxburghianus is also valued for its nutritional content, as its seeds are a good source of protein and minerals."
