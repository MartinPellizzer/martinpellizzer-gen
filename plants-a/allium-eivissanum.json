    "intro": "Allium eivissanum, commonly known as the Eivissa garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Balearic Islands, specifically Mallorca and Menorca, where it grows in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pale purple flowers and has bulbous roots that are similar to garlic. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
