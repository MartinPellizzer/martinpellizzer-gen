It features compact, succulent-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and garden design."
