    "intro": "Asplenium desvauxii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium desvauxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
