    "intro": "Acer laetum var. rubrum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The leaves are typically palmate with five lobes, and they turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. It produces small, winged seeds called samaras, which are dispersed by the wind. The tree prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
