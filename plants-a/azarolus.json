    "intro": "Azarolus, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Azarolus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
