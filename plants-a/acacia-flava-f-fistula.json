    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia flava f. fistula is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This subspecies is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often forming dense thickets. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is also observed in some parts of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flava f. fistula was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is often associated with disturbed habitats and has been reported in urban and agricultural areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soils, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites. However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it is not yet classified as invasive in most regions."
