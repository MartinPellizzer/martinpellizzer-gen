    "intro": "Asplenium wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly waxy texture. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it anchor to substrates, while its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shady garden settings."
