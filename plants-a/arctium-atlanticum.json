    "intro": "Arctium atlanticum, commonly known as the eastern burdock, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with coarse, woolly hairs. The plant produces large, spiny burrs that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with serrated edges. Arctium atlanticum thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges."
