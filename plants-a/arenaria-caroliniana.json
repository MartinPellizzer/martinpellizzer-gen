    "intro": "Arenaria caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is an important species for stabilizing coastal and sandy habitats due to its hardy nature and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
