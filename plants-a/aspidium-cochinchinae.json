    "intro": "Aspidium cochinchinae, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium cochinchinae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
