    "intro": "Asplenium protractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows. Asplenium protractum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its intricate foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and conservation efforts."
