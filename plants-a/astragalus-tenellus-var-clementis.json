    "intro": "Astragalus tenellus var. clementis, commonly known as the Clement's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to low moisture conditions. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This variety is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
