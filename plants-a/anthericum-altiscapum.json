    "intro": "Anthericum altiscapum, commonly known as the tall bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features upright, slender stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale blue flowers. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a basal rosette, and the plant produces small, three-lobed berries that are dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Anthericum altiscapum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
