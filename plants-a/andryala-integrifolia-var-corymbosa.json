    "intro": "Andryala integrifolia var. corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to Arctic and alpine regions. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are pollinated by wind and insects. Its woody stems are often prostrate or ascending, forming dense mats that stabilize soil in harsh conditions. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other varieties of Andryala integrifolia."
