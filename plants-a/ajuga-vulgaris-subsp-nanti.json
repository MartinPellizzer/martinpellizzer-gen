    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris subsp. nanti, commonly known as carpet bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming thick carpets that help prevent soil erosion."
