It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention in its native habitat. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, with colors ranging from white to pink. Asplundia peruviana is valued for its starchy rhizomes, which are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
