    "intro": "Allium caucasium, commonly known as Caucasian leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, cylindrical, hollow leaves that resemble those of a leek. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers arranged in a umbel, which bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful crop in some regions. Allium caucasium is often cultivated for both culinary and ornamental purposes."
