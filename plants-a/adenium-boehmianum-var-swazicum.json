It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk and smooth, often fissured bark. The plant produces striking red flowers that bloom at the base of the trunk, and its leaves are typically alternate and elliptical. It is adapted to arid environments and stores water in its stem for drought survival. This species is also noted for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds.",
