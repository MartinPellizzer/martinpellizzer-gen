    "intro": "Anthemis carpatica subsp. petraea, commonly known as the rock anthemis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries for its drought tolerance and visual appeal."
