    "intro": "Agropyron tanaiticum, commonly known as the Tanaitic wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Agropyron tanaiticum is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
