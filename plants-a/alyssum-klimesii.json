    "intro": "Alyssum klimesii, commonly known as Klimes' alyssum, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern California. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Alyssum klimesii is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
