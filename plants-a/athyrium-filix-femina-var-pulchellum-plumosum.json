    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. pulchellum-plumosum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a varietal form of the lady fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a delicate, almost ethereal appearance. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive silver-white coloration on the underside. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal."
