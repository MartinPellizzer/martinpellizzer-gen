    "intro": "Alchemilla asterophylla, commonly known as the star-leaved lady's mantle, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of silky hairs, giving them a distinctive silver-green appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions. Alchemilla asterophylla is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used to treat skin irritations and digestive issues."
