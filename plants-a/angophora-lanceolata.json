    "intro": "Angophora lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf angophora, is a species of flowering plant in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae. It is native to eastern Australia, where it typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. It produces woody capsules as its fruit, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. Angophora lanceolata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
