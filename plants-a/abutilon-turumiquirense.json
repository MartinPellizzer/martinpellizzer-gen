This species is found in the northern regions of the country, particularly in the states of Zulia and Anzo\u00e1tegui. It thrives in tropical and subtropical environments, often growing in coastal areas and along riverbanks. The plant is adapted to the warm, humid climate of these regions. Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Venezuela.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon turumiquirense was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and along riverbanks. This plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it an invasive species in some regions. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
