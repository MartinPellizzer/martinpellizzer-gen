    "intro": "Aerva, commonly known as goat's beard, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Amaranthaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, feather-like leaves. Aerva species often produce clusters of tiny, greenish or yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
