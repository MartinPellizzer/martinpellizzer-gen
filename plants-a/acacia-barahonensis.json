    "intro": "Acacia barahonensis, commonly known as the Barahon acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Barahona in the Dominican Republic. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is adapted to the tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia barahonensis is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the dry deciduous forests and spiny forest regions of the country. This species is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is not found anywhere else in the world. It typically grows in areas with low rainfall and well-drained soils. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and threatened plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia barahonensis was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas where it can thrive in dry to semi-arid conditions. This plant has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific and Caribbean, where it has adapted to local ecosystems. Its introduction has often been for ornamental purposes or as a potential source of timber and fuel. However, in some regions, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local biodiversity."
