    "intro": "Asplenium appendiculatum var. angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
