    "intro": "Aulomyrcia rufipes, commonly known as the red-legged orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge along the edges. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive red and yellow coloration, which attract specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, Aulomyrcia rufipes is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
