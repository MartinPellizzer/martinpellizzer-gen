    "intro": "Acer niveum, commonly known as the snow maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, heart-shaped leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age. Acer niveum thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in subalpine and alpine zones.",
