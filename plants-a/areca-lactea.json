    "intro": "Areca lactea, commonly known as the white areca palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate makes it suitable for indoor cultivation or as a landscape plant in tropical gardens. Areca lactea is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
