    "intro": "Astragalus microcephalus, commonly known as the small-headed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, round pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
