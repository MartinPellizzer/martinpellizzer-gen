    "intro": "Aechmea fusca, commonly known as the rusty-tipped air plant, is a species of bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically green with reddish or purplish tips, giving it its common name. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is well adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forests or on rocky outcrops."
