    "intro": "Asplenium pellucidum var. ponapense, commonly known as the Ponape spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the tropical Pacific islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves that often have a translucent or waxy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. It has small, clustered sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
