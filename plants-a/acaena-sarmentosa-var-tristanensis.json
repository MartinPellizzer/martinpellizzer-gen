    "intro": "Acaena sarmentosa var. tristanensis, commonly known as the Tristan alpine cushion, is a low-growing shrub native to the subantarctic islands of the Tristan da Cunha group. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant produces bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in harsh, windy environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. This variety is notable for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its remote, isolated environment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sarmentosa var. tristanensis is primarily native to the Subantarctic islands of the Southern Ocean, including the South Orkney Islands, South Shetland Islands, and the Crozet Archipelago. This variety is commonly found in rocky and coastal habitats, often growing in areas with strong winds and limited soil. It thrives in the harsh environmental conditions typical of these remote regions. The plant is well adapted to the cold climate and low nutrient soils of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the local ecosystems of these islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sarmentosa var. tristanensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as part of the ornamental plant trade. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in the South Island. It is commonly found in coastal and subalpine areas, often growing in disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some habitats due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
