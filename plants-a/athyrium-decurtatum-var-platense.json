    "intro": "Athyrium decurtatum var. platense, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a striking fern species native to eastern Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds with broad, lance-shaped pinnae that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of dark green, glossy leaves. The varietal form platense is characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical variety, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
