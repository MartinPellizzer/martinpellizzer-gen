    "intro": "Ardisia minutiflora, commonly known as the dwarf flame tree, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically oval in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. These flowers are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Ardisia minutiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions."
