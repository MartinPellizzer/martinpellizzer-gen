    "intro": "Astragalus medicagineus var. paucijugus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are bipinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
