It is a small, globular cactus with a distinctive appearance, featuring a short stem covered in clusters of spines. The spines are curved and often have a reddish or brownish color, giving the plant its common name. It produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which bloom at the base of the spines. This plant is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for succulent collections."
