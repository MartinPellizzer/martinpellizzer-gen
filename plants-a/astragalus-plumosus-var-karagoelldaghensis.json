    "intro": "Astragalus plumosus var. karagoelldaghensis, commonly known as the Karagoeldagh milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, feathery leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
