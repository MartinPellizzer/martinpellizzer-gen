    "intro": "Aldama lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Aldama lanceolata is well adapted to drought and is often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
