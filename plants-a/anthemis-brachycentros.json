    "intro": "Anthemis brachycentros, commonly known as the short-centred ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
