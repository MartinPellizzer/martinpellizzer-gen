    "intro": "Asplenium mangindranense, commonly known as the Mangindranense spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are usually dark green and covered in a fine layer of trichomes. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is native to Madagascar and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological characteristics and limited distribution."
