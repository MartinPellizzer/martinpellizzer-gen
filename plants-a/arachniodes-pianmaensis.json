    "intro": "Arachniodes pianmaensis, commonly known as the Pianma fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often adorned with a silvery or metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. The Pianma fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
