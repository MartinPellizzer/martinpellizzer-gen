    "intro": "Anisacanthus wrightii, commonly known as desert hibiscus, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural spread in desert ecosystems."
