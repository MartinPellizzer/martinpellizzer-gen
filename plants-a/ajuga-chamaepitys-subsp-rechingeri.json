It features a dense mat of dark green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for alpine gardens and rockeries."
