    "intro": "Arenaria leptoclados subsp. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its compact growth habit and ability to colonize sandy or rocky habitats make it a common component of dry grasslands and dunes. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
