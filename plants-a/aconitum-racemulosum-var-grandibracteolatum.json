    "intro": "Aconitum racemulosum var. grandibracteolatum, commonly known as the giant bract aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, adorned with large, showy blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense raceme. The leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are often hairy and dark green in color. This variety is distinguished by its large, leaf-like bracts that enclose the flower cluster, giving it a unique and striking appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a notable addition to woodland gardens.",
