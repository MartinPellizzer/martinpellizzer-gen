    "intro": "Acacia rotundata, commonly known as the knobthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its twisted, gnarled branches and small, round leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, followed by flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Acacia rotundata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species in regions with limited rainfall. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rotundata is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in savannas, grasslands, and rocky outcrops where the climate is semi-arid to arid. This species is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, thriving in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Acacia rotundata is also known for its distinctive globular seed pods and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rotundata was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and along the eastern coast, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to provide shade and habitat for wildlife. However, it has also been reported to spread beyond its intended areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution highlights the need for careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
