    "intro": "Anaphalis sinica, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the fine, silver-colored hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Anaphalis sinica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
