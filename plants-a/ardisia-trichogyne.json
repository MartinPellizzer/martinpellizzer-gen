    "intro": "Ardisia trichogyne, commonly known as the glossy wood sorrel, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The berries are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle the plant with care."
