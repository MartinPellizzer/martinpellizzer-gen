    "intro": "Anchietea salutaris var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy anchietea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a terminal raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
