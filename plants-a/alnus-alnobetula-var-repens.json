    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula var. repens, commonly known as the creeping alder, is a deciduous shrub native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or colonies. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, followed by oval, dark green leaves that turn yellow in autumn. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and disturbed sites. This species plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
