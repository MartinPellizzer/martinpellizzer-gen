    "intro": "Athyrium acutipinnulum, commonly known as the narrow-pinnate lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
