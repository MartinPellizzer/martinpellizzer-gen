It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
