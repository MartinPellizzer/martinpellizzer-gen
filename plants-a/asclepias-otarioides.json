    "intro": "Asclepias otarioides, commonly known as the otter milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its showy, orange to yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its unique floral structure includes specialized structures called corona, which aid in pollination by attracting specific insects. Asclepias otarioides is also a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the pipevine swallowtail."
