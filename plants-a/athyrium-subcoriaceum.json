    "intro": "Athyrium subcoriaceum, commonly known as the velvet shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in water retention. The fronds are divided into lance-shaped segments, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of the leaves."
