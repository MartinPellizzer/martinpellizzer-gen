    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha fournieri is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Gulf, and Mexico Southwest. This species is commonly found in these regions, where it thrives in a variety of habitats. It is often associated with disturbed areas, such as roadsides and open fields. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening. Its native range is limited to these specific areas within Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha fournieri was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to environmental stress. It is commonly found along roadsides, in abandoned lots, and in areas with human activity. This plant has been reported in several regions of the Americas, including parts of the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. Its introduction is likely due to accidental dispersal through human activities such as construction and landscaping. However, its ecological impact remains under study, as it has not been widely documented as an invasive species."
