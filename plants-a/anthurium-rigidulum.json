    "intro": "Anthurium rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid flame anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated spadix and brightly colored spathe, which are typical features of the Araceae family. The plant thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that are often glossy and arranged in a rosette pattern. Anthurium rigidulum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
