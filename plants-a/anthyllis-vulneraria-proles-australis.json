    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria proles australis, commonly known as the southern woundwort, is a flowering plant native to southern regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is often found in dry, calcareous soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its medicinal properties were historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
