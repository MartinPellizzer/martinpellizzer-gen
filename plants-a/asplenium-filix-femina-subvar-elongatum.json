    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina subvar. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and prefers well-draining, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically found on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
