    "intro": "Anthurium truncicola, commonly known as the rough-leaved anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by colorful, spatulate bracts that range from red to orange. Anthurium truncicola thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for indoor and greenhouse cultivation."
