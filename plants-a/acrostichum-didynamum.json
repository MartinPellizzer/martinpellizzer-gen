    "intro": "Acrostichum didynamum, commonly known as the dwarf chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, pinnate fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori along the veins. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.",
