    "intro": "Andropogon polyatherus, commonly known as purple bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and striking purple tinge on its foliage, which becomes more pronounced in the fall. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon polyatherus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
