    "intro": "Azorella lycopodioides var. compacta, commonly known as the cushion moss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, giving it a moss-like appearance. It is adapted to cold, arid climates and often grows on rocky substrates at elevations above 3,000 meters. This variety is notable for its resilience and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
