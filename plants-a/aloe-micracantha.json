It features compact, upright growth with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is sometimes used for its medicinal properties. Aloe micracantha is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
