    "intro": "Anemia marginalis, commonly known as iron deficiency anemia, is a condition characterized by a lack of sufficient healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to the body's tissues. It is primarily caused by inadequate iron intake or poor absorption of iron from the diet. The botanical aspects of this condition are not directly related to plant species but rather to the nutritional needs of humans. However, certain plants such as spinach, lentils, and fortified cereals can help prevent or manage iron deficiency. These plants are rich in iron and other essential nutrients that support overall health and hemoglobin production."
