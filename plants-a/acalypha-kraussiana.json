    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha kraussiana is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and the Andaman Islands. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha kraussiana was mainly introduced to coastal and disturbed areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in sandy soils along shorelines and in urban environments. The plant thrives in areas with high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding. It is often used for erosion control and as a decorative plant in landscaping. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its establishment in many non-native habitats."
