    "intro": "Astragalus alamliensis, commonly known as Persian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus alamliensis is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
