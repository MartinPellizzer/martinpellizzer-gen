    "intro": "Albizia saman, commonly known as the rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn bright yellow before falling in response to seasonal changes. The tree produces small, cream-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Albizia saman is often planted for its ornamental value and ability to provide shade in urban and rural landscapes."
