    "intro": "Aconitum tanguticum f. robustum, commonly known as the robust Tibetan aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its root system is tuberous, which is typical for many members of the genus Aconitum. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is handled with care and is not commonly cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
