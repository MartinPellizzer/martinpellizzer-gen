    "intro": "Aster siskiyouensis, commonly known as Siskiyou aster, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular florets that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
