    "intro": "Adiantum monosoratum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum monosoratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
