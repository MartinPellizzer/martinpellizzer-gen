    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. comosus, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves that form a dense canopy. The plant produces a distinctive, spiky flower spike that eventually develops into the edible fruit. The fruit is a multiple fruit, formed from the fusion of many flowers, and is rich in bromelain and other enzymes. Its leaves and fruit are both used in culinary and commercial applications."
