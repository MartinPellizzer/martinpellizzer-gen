    "intro": "Alkanna orientalis, commonly known as the Indian madder, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces red-orange roots that contain a natural dye called alkannin, which has been used historically for coloring textiles and cosmetics. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating. Alkanna orientalis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid climates."
