    "intro": "Aegilops, commonly known as goatgrass, is a genus of wild grasses belonging to the tribe Avenae. These plants are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Aegilops species are characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance and produce small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. They are often found growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Some species of Aegilops have been studied for their potential in breeding programs to improve wheat varieties."
