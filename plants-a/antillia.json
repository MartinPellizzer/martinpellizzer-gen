    "intro": "Antillia, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Malvaceae, characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found near the shoreline, where it tolerates high salinity and coastal winds. Antillia has small, palmate leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its blooming period typically occurs during the dry season, making it a symbol of resilience in challenging ecological conditions."
