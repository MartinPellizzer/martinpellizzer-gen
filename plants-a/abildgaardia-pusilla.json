    "intro": "Abildgaardia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf abildgaardia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few centimeters, with tiny, clustered leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in open habitats such as tundra and mountain meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pusilla is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the region of the Western Cape, particularly in the fynbos biome. This small flowering plant grows in rocky and sandy soils along the coastline. It is commonly seen in areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by wet winters and dry summers. Abildgaardia pusilla is a rare and endemic species, often growing in sheltered microhabitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pusilla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 1980s and has since become established in several regions. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. It is considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to be through accidental transport via human activity."
