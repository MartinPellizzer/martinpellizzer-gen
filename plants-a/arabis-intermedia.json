    "intro": "Arabis intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Arabis intermedia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
