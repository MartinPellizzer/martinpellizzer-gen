    "intro": "Ardisia venusta, commonly known as the velvetleaf ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Following flowering, it develops bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Ardisia venusta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
