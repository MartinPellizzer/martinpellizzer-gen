    "intro": "Aristolochia arcuata, commonly known as the hooded Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that are typically purple or brown in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, green berries that mature to a dark purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
