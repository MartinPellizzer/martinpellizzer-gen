    "intro": "Aloe tenuior var. viridifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically a bluish-green color, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, branching inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and attractive foliage, it is often used in rock gardens and as a container plant."
