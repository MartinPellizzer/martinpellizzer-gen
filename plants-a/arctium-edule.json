    "intro": "Arctium edule, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features rough, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Arctium edule is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, growing up to 1.5 meters in height."
