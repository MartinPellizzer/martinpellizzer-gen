    "intro": "Agave humilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Agave humilis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
