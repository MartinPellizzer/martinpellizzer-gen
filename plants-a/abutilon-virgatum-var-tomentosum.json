It is also found in the coastal regions of the Gulf Coast and along the Atlantic coast. This plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal dunes and maritime hammocks. It is often associated with disturbed or open habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its native range extends into parts of the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon virgatum var. tomentosum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as roadsides and stream banks. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its hairy leaves and showy flowers make it a distinctive and sometimes ornamental species."
