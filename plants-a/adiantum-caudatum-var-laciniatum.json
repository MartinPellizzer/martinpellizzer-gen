    "intro": "Adiantum caudatum var. laciniatum, commonly known as the feather-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that give it a feathery appearance, and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually through underground stems. Its leaves are typically bioluminescent, with a distinctive black or dark green coloration on the underside. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in shaded garden settings or as a houseplant.",
