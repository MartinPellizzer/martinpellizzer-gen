    "intro": "Adenopa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Adenopa is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative means make it an invasive species in many areas."
