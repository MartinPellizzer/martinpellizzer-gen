It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. The flowers feature white petals with subtle pink or purple veining, contributing to its ornamental appeal.",
