    "intro": "Aechmea lagenaria, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces an inflorescence with vivid red bracts that surround a cluster of small white flowers. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Aechmea lagenaria is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
