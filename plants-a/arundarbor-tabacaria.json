    "intro": "Arundarbor tabacaria, commonly known as the tobacco plant, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is notable for its production of nicotine-rich leaves, which have been historically used in tobacco products. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing in moist, temperate climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in many agricultural settings."
