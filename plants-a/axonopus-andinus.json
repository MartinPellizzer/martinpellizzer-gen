    "intro": "Axonopus andinus, commonly known as the Andean axonopus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to South America. It typically forms dense mats on the ground, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green in color. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Axonopus andinus is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its natural habitat."
