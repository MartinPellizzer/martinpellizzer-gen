    "intro": "Arrhenatherum lachnanthum, commonly known as slender wood oat, is a grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream sides, and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in conservation-focused habitats."
