    "intro": "Astragalus microfoliolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
