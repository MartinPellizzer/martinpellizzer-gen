    "intro": "Aregelia concentrica var. proserpinae, commonly known as the Crimson Crown Begonia, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored leaves that display a combination of deep red and green hues, often with a central vein that stands out in contrasting colors. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden beds or as a potted plant."
