    "intro": "Aeschynomene hispida, commonly known as hairy horsegram, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop due to its nutritional value for livestock. Aeschynomene hispida is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
