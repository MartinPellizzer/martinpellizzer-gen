It is a member of the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and stream banks. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive pinnate arrangement of pinnae. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
