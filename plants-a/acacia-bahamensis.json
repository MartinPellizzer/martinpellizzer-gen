    "intro": "Acacia bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian acacia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Bahamas. It features compound leaves with small, paired leaflets and produces yellow, spherical flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its root system helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Acacia bahamensis plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and birds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia bahamensis is primarily native to the Bahamas. It is found throughout the islands of the Bahamas, including Andros, Acklins, and Great Inagua. This plant thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in dry, open habitats. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the tropical climate of the region. Acacia bahamensis is also occasionally found in the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia bahamensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly the Bahamas, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance. It has since spread to other tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Florida and the Gulf Coast of the United States. The plant's introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various environments. Despite its ornamental value, its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have raised ecological alarms."
