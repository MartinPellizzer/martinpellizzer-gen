    "intro": "Asclepias filiformis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with silky appendages, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Asclepias filiformis is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
