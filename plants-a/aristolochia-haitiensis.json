It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-brown in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
