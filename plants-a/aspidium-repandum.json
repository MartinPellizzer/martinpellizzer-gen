    "intro": "Aspidium repandum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically borne on long, creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive row along the veins. Aspidium repandum is a hardy plant that plays an important role in aquatic and wetland ecosystems."
