    "intro": "Albizia isenbergiana, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnate and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Albizia isenbergiana is often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal."
