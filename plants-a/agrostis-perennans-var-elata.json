    "intro": "Agrostis perennans var. elata, commonly known as tall bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green color, while the inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixtures for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
