    "intro": "Athyrium hachijoense, commonly known as the Hachijo fern, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green with a fine, silky texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, humus-filled soil. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
