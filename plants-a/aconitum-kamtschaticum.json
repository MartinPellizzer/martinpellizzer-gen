    "intro": "Aconitum kamtschaticum, commonly known as the Siberian aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia and the Caucasus. It features striking blue to purple spathaceous flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that contributes to its ornamental appeal. However, all parts of the plant contain potent toxins, making it both dangerous and requiring careful handling.",
