    "intro": "Amasonia erecta var. sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland amsonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flower heads in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and form dense, attractive clumps over time."
