    "intro": "Allium lancifolium, commonly known as the Chinese leek or garlic chives, is a hardy perennial plant native to East Asia. It features long, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces umbels of white or pale purple flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, bulbous fruits. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in Asian cuisine. Allium lancifolium thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental and culinary gardens."
