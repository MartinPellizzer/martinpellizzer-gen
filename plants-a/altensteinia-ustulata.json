    "intro": "Altensteinia ustulata, commonly known as the flameleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Altensteinia ustulata is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits in forest ecosystems."
