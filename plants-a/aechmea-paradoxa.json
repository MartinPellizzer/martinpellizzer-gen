    "intro": "Aechmea paradoxa, commonly known as the velvet leaf bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The leaves are covered in a dense, velvety coating that gives the plant its common name. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
