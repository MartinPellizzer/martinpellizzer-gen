    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. contracta, commonly known as slender basketgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is a low-growing perennial grass characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often contracted or compressed, giving it its specific epithet \"contracta.\" The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
