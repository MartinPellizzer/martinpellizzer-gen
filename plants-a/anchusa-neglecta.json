    "intro": "Anchusa neglecta, commonly known as the woolly blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that produces striking clusters of blue or purple flowers. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
