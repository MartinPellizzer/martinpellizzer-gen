It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring sepals that are unequal in size. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Anisosepalum humbertii is of interest to botanists due to its distinct morphology and limited distribution."
