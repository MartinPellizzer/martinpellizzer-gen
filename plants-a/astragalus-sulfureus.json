    "intro": "Astragalus sulfureus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its legume fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus sulfureus is well adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures."
