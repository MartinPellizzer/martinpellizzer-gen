    "intro": "Arequipiopsis weingartiana, commonly known as the Arequipiopsis plant, is a flowering species native to the high Andes of Peru. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, a feature adapted to its arid environment. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that bloom in shades of red and orange, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
