    "intro": "Avena sempervirens subsp. notarisii, commonly known as the Armenian oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
