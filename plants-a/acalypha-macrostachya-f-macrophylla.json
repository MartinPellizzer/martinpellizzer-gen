    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya f. macrophylla is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in moist lowland forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with humid climates and is often seen in secondary growth areas. The plant is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Its native range extends into northern Australia, where it grows in similar ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha macrostachya f. macrophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial expansion period. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a non-native species."
