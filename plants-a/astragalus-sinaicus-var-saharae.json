    "intro": "Astragalus sinaicus var. saharae, commonly known as the Sinai Astragalus, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert or semi-arid environments. It has adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
