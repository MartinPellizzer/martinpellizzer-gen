    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme subsp. lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's rock\u767d\u83dc, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, often white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This subspecies is native to Central Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens and alpine settings."
