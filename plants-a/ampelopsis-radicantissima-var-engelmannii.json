It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by round, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The berries are edible but not widely cultivated for agricultural purposes."
