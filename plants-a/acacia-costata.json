    "intro": "Acacia costata, commonly known as the serrated wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often grows in coastal or sandy soils. Acacia costata is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia costata is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including heathlands, woodlands, and rocky outcrops. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions typical of much of Western Australia. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western parts of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia costata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the exotic plant introductions that accompanied European colonization. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and has become naturalized in several regions. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
