    "intro": "Aristolochia trulliformis, commonly known as the trumpet vine or hooded vine, is a climbing plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a trumpet, typically ranging in color from greenish-yellow to reddish-brown. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, dark berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant, though caution is needed due to its toxicity."
