    "intro": "Aristida combsii, commonly known as the Comb's threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and inflorescence composed of three rows of spikelets, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops, thriving in poor soils and low moisture conditions. Its small, spikelet-based flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought and heat. Aristida combsii is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
