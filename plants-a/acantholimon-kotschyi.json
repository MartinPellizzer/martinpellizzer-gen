It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and receives limited rainfall. The species is commonly observed in mountainous and coastal regions. Its distribution is closely associated with specific microhabitats in the Mediterranean climate zones of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon kotschyi was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats, where it can thrive with minimal water requirements. This plant is commonly used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance needs. Its introduction has been primarily for ornamental purposes in gardens and landscapes. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
