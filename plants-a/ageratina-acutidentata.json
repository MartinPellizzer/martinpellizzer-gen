    "intro": "Ageratina acutidentata, commonly known as whiteflower false fleabane, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. Ageratina acutidentata is often found in disturbed habitats and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
