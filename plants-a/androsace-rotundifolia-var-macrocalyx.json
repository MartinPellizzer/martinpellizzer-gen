It features dense, mat-forming foliage with rounded, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often resembling a cushion or dome shape. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine displays."
