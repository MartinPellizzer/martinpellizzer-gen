    "intro": "Acacia deltoidea subsp. ampla, commonly known as the broad-leaf acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its woody pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species is often used in traditional medicine and for soil stabilization in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia deltoidea subsp. ampla is primarily native to Western Australia. This subspecies is commonly found in the southern and southwestern regions of the state. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including sandy soils and coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia deltoidea subsp. ampla was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It was brought there for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant is commonly used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. It has also been introduced to other parts of southern Africa, including Namibia and Botswana. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
