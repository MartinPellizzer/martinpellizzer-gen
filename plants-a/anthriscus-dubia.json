    "intro": "Anthriscus dubia, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish flowers. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. The plant has a slender, hollow stem and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature among plants in the carrot family. Anthriscus dubia is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes but is sometimes used in wildflower gardens for its delicate appearance."
