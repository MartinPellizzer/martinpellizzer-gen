    "intro": "Allium drepanophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and leeks, and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs and leaves that are often used in culinary applications, similar to other Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and useful in both gardens and kitchens."
