    "intro": "Arenaria laricifolia var. hultenii, commonly known as Hulten's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its horticultural value and ability to form attractive ground covers in rock gardens and alpine settings."
