    "intro": "Asplenium lepturus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rock surfaces or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its spores are produced in compact, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium lepturus is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
