    "intro": "Arkezostis lhotzkiana, commonly known as the Lhotskian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arkezostis lhotzkiana is valued for its ornamental beauty and is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
