    "intro": "Astragalus dependens var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers. The plant has compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and its root system is extensive, adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. It belongs to the legume family (Fabaceae), which is known for nitrogen-fixing capabilities through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This species is often found in dry grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
