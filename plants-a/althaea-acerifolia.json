    "intro": "Althaea acerifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf mallow, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with five to seven lobes and a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and mucilaginous leaves have historically been used in traditional herbal medicine. Althaea acerifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and streambanks."
