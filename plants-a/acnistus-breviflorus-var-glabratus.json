    "intro": "Acnistus breviflorus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-flowered acnistus, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Africa. It features hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are borne on slender pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions.",
