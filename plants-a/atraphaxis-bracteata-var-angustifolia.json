    "intro": "Atraphaxis bracteata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf desert parsley, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which bloom in the spring and are followed by small, dry fruits. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems that allow it to access groundwater. This species is often found in rocky soils and is a valuable component of desert ecosystems."
