    "intro": "Apocynum farwellii f. anomalum, commonly known as the Farwell's milkweed, is a rare variant of the species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often hairy leaves, which are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, like other members of the Apocynaceae family, contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
