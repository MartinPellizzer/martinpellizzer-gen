    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. ungavensis, commonly known as the Alpine bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in mountainous environments where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
