    "intro": "Alectorolophus freynii, commonly known as the Freyn's spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or biennial, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, a characteristic feature of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies in its native range."
