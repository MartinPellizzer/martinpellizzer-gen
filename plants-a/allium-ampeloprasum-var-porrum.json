    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum var. porrum, commonly known as leek, is a hardy perennial plant belonging to the Amaryllidaceae family. It is characterized by its long, cylindrical, hollow stems that are typically green to bluish in color. The plant produces grass-like leaves that form a dense rosette near the base, and it blooms with umbels of white or pale purple flowers. Its bulb, which is the edible part, is composed of modified leaves that store nutrients. This variety is valued for its mild, onion-like flavor and is widely cultivated for culinary use."
