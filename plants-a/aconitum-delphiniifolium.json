    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium, commonly known as the Delphinium-leaved Aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in racemes, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed, resembling those of delphinium, hence its common name. Aconitum delphiniifolium contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
