    "intro": "Actinidia strigosa, commonly known as the hairy actinidia, is a deciduous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, followed by edible, yellowish berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible landscaping. Actinidia strigosa is also valued for its ability to support local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals.",
