    "intro": "Aloe rubescens, commonly known as the red aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically red or pink in color, especially when exposed to full sunlight. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Aloe rubescens is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its gel is less commonly used compared to other aloe species."
