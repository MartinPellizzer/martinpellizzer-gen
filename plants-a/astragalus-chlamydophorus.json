    "intro": "Astragalus chlamydophorus, commonly known as the golden milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. It is often found in dry grasslands and along rocky slopes, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and nitrogen fixation. Astragalus chlamydophorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
