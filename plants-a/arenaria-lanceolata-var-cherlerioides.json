It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
