    "intro": "Acetosella caesia, commonly known as mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often appearing before the leaves are fully developed. The plant has oval, succulent leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky habitats. Acetosella caesia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits.",
