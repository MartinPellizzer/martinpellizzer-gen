    "intro": "Aglaonema pumilum, commonly known as the Dwarf Chinese Evergreen, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, variegated leaves with a combination of green, white, and pink hues, making it a popular ornamental plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers, though it is more admired for its foliage than its blooms. It thrives in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aglaonema pumilum is relatively easy to care for, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
