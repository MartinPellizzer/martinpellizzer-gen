    "intro": "Alcinaeanthus, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Alcinaeanthus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
