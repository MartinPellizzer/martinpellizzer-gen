This species is commonly found in the southern and northern regions of New Zealand, where it thrives in a variety of habitats. It is often associated with coastal and subalpine environments, growing in rocky or sandy soils. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its distinctive bracts and small flowers. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the unique ecological conditions of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena profundeincisa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was initially cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscaped areas. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly and outcompeting native vegetation. Its establishment has led to concerns over its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts are now underway to control its spread and manage its impact in affected regions."
