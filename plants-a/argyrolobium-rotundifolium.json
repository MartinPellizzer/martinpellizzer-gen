    "intro": "Argyrolobium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaf silverlobium, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are rounded and often covered in a fine, silvery coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
