    "intro": "Agrostis tremula, commonly known as trembling grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which are small, greenish-brown structures containing the flowers. Agrostis tremula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
