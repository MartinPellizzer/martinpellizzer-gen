It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Anthistiria andropogonoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
