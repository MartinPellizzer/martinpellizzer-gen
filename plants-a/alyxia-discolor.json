    "intro": "Alyxia discolor, commonly known as the pink mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and woodland edges. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Alyxia discolor is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
