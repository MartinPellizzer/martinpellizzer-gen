It is a member of the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in well-drained soils. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
