    "intro": "Austrocephalocereus streckeri, commonly known as the Strecker's cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its adaptations include thick, fleshy stems for water storage and a waxy cuticle to reduce transpiration. The species is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments."
