    "intro": "Asplenium concinnum, commonly known as the round spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has a compact rosette of dark green, leathery leaves that are usually rounded or ovate in shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium concinnum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
