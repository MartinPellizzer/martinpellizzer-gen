    "intro": "Angiopteris cadierei, commonly known as the Cadi\u00e8re's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the water. Angiopteris cadierei plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
