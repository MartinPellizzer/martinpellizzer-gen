    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abbevillea phaea is primarily native to the Atlantic coastal plain of the southeastern United States. It is found in states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. This plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and in wetlands. It is commonly associated with the Carolinas and is part of the Lythraceae family. Abbevillea phaea is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abbevillea phaea was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states such as Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. The introduction has led to its establishment in various habitats, including disturbed soils and wetlands. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Conservation efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
