    "intro": "Astragalus enoplus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, narrow leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus enoplus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
