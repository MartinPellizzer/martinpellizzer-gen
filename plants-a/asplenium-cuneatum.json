    "intro": "Asplenium cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. Asplenium cuneatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
