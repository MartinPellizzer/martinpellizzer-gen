    "intro": "Agenium nutans, commonly known as the drooping agave, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that droop downward. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale green flowers that bloom in the spring. Agenium nutans is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
