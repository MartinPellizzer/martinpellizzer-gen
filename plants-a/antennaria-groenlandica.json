    "intro": "Antennaria groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of tiny yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its morphology includes a prostrate growth habit, which helps it conserve heat and avoid wind damage. Antennaria groenlandica plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and supports local pollinators."
