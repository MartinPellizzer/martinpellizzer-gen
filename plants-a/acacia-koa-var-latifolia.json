    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia koa var. latifolia is primarily native to the Hawaiian Islands, specifically the Big Island and Maui. This variety of Acacia koa is found in coastal and lowland areas, often in dry, well-drained soils. It thrives in the tropical climate of Hawaii, where it plays an important ecological role. The plant is commonly found in native forests and along the coastlines of these islands. It is an important species for both ecological and cultural reasons in Hawaiian ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia koa var. latifolia was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become naturalized in certain areas. It is commonly found in lowland and coastal regions, particularly in dry to mesic habitats. This plant is often used for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil types. However, it can sometimes compete with native plant species, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Despite its popularity, its distribution remains limited compared to other introduced species in the region."
