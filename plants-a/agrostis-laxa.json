    "intro": "Agrostis laxa, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth habits and is often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 mm in width, and its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, two-rowed spikelets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common ornamental and turfgrass species. Agrostis laxa is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
