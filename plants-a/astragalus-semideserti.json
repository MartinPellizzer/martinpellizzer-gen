    "intro": "Astragalus semideserti, commonly known as desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep root systems and minimal water requirements. Astragalus semideserti plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
