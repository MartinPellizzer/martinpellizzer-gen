    "intro": "Aulonemia patula, commonly known as the slender marsh fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and moist environments in North America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies in its preferred habitat. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the underside of the fronds. Aulonemia patula plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
