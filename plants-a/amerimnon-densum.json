    "intro": "Amerimnon densum, commonly known as the dense-leaved fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green fronds that are often clustered closely together. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as under the canopy of rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The leaves are pinnate, with a feathery appearance, and they contribute to the plant's ornamental value in botanical gardens."
