    "intro": "Anemone pulsatilla var. montsicciana, commonly known as the Montsiccian pasqueflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Pyrenees. It features a rosette of basal, hairy, and often blue-green leaves that help it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, and it is often found in meadows and grasslands. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
