    "intro": "Achatocarpus microcarpus var. subspathulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow. The plant produces small, hard, woody fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal or disturbed habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in reforestation efforts and as a source of timber.",
