    "intro": "Alsine laricifolia, commonly known as the pine-leaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Its flowers are tiny and clustered in dense inflorescences, producing small, capsule-like fruits. Alsine laricifolia is well adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
