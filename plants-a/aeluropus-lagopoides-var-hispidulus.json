    "intro": "Aeluropus lagopoides var. hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy sandgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, compact foliage. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves covered with fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in dry environments. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines."
