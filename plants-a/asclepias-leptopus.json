    "intro": "Asclepias leptopus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive horn-shaped buds, typical of the milkweed genus. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nectar for adult butterflies and a site for laying eggs. Asclepias leptopus is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
