    "intro": "Antirrhinum cirrhosum, commonly known as the curly willow or curly snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces seeds in small capsules. Antirrhinum cirrhosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
