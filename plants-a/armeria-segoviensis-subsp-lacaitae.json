    "intro": "Armeria segoviensis subsp. lacaitae, commonly known as the Segovia thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
