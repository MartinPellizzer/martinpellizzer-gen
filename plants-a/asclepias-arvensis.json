    "intro": "Asclepias arvensis, commonly known as field milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, parachute-like seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Asclepias arvensis is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting its life cycle."
