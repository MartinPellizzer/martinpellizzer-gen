    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium var. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, followed by follicles that contain toxic, orange-red seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
