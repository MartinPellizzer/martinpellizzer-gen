    "intro": "Alnus acuminata subsp. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous tree native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves and small, catkin-like flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. It plays a vital role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological contributions in forest ecosystems."
