    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosum var. sparmannioides is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The species is often seen growing in the shade of larger plants or in dry, sunny environments. Its native range includes countries like Cuba, Jamaica, and the Bahamas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ramosum var. sparmannioides was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value and ease of care. This plant is also valued for its adaptability to different soil types and its tolerance to urban environments. However, it has been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential ecological impact in non-native habitats."
