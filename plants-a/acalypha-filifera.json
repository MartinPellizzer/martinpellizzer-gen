    "intro": "Acalypha filifera, commonly known as silky acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs covering the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha filifera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and can be found in both natural and cultivated environments. Its distribution extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha filifera was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions across the country. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and riverine areas. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to colonize disturbed sites and its prolific seed production. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
