    "intro": "Astragalus scleropodius, commonly known as the hardpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus scleropodius is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
