    "intro": "Androsace sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Androsace sarmentosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions where it contributes to the alpine flora."
