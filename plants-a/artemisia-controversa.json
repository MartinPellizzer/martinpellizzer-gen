    "intro": "Artemisia controversa, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
