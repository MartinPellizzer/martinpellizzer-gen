    "intro": "Alsine libanotica, commonly known as the Lebanon sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters and features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. The plant has alternate, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to arid environments, with a compact growth form and efficient water use."
