    "intro": "Ajuga pallescens var. hirsuta, commonly known as hairy ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are softly hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens."
