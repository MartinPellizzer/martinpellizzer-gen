    "intro": "Aristida calycina var. filifolia, commonly known as silky false oatgrass, is a grass species native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its fine, thread-like leaves that give it a silky appearance, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it a valuable plant for erosion control. It is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
