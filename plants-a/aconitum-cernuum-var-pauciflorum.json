    "intro": "Aconitum cernuum var. pauciflorum, commonly known as the slender monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is noted for its reduced flowering compared to the typical A. cernuum, making it a unique addition to woodland gardens.",
