    "intro": "Alnus incana subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils near water sources such as streams and wetlands. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its association with root nodules. The species is valued for its ecological importance in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
