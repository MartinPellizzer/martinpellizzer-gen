It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red in color.

Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within its family."
