    "intro": "Armeria ruscinonensis var. catalaunica, commonly known as the Catalan thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
