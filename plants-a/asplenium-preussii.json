    "intro": "Asplenium preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, dark green fronds with a distinctive, narrow, and often curled shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium preussii is native to regions in Africa, particularly in the tropical and subtropical zones."
