    "intro": "Adenia globosa subsp. globosa, commonly known as the globular adenium, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its root system is adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The species is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and resilience.",
