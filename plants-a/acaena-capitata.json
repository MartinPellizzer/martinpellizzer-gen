It is commonly found in the southern regions of the country, including the South Island and some parts of the North Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, such as forests, grasslands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and can tolerate both wet and dry conditions. Acaena capitata is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena capitata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest margins. However, it is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
