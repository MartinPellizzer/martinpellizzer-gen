It is a perennial shrub characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is adapted to poor soil conditions. Its fibrous stems and leaves are often used in traditional medicine. Argythamnia aphoroides plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for small animals."
