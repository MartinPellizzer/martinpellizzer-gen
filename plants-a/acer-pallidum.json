    "intro": "Acer pallidum, commonly known as the white maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, often weeping branches and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are pale green on top and white underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The white maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its elegant appearance.",
