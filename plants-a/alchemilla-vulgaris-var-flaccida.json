    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. flaccida, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are softly hairy and have a distinctive scalloped margin, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate partial shade."
