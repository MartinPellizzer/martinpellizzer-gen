    "intro": "Acantholimon zaeifii, commonly known as the Zaeif's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran, where it adapts to the harsh climatic conditions. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon zaeifii was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and semi-arid climates, typically found in regions with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. It is commonly found in disturbed or degraded habitats such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and open areas with minimal vegetation. This plant is often associated with Mediterranean-type climates, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to several regions beyond its native range for ornamental or ecological restoration purposes. Its distribution is limited by its specific environmental requirements, making it a rare and specialized species."
