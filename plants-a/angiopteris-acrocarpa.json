    "intro": "Angiopteris acrocarpa, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, deeply lobed fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Angiopteris acrocarpa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to create a lush, tropical atmosphere in gardens."
