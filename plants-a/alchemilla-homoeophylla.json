    "intro": "Alchemilla homoeophylla, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters at the ends of stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Alchemilla homoeophylla thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
