    "intro": "Astrantia gracilis, commonly known as slender aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features delicate, lace-like flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink, typically from late summer to early autumn. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and produces numerous small, clustered flower heads. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Astrantia gracilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
