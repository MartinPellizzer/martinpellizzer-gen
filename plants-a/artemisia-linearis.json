    "intro": "Artemisia linearis, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Artemisia linearis thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid regions. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and traditional herbal uses."
