    "intro": "Alternanthera polygonoides var. radicans, commonly known as the wandering willow, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features long, flexible stems that trail along the water's surface, often creating a flowing, willow-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, followed by red or orange berries. Its leaves are ovate to lance-shaped and can display vibrant red or pink hues, especially when exposed to bright light. This variety is popular in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a range of water conditions."
