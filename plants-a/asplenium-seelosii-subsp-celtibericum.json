    "intro": "Asplenium seelosii subsp. celtibericum, commonly known as the Celtiberian rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and thrives in rocky, calcareous environments. The fronds are typically leathery and have a distinctive, upright growth habit. It is often found in crevices and on limestone substrates, preferring shaded, humid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
