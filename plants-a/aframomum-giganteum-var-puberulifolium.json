It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red berries. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported medicinal properties. This variant is closely related to other members of the Zingiberaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and aromatic qualities."
