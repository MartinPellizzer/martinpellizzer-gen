The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in racemes at the top of the stem. Its leaves are compound, with deeply cut lobes, and it has a distinctive, toxic root system. Aconitum nipponicum is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains potent alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested.",
