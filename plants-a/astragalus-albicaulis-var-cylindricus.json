    "intro": "Astragalus albicaulis var. cylindricus, commonly known as the white-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open plains or along dry streambeds. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
