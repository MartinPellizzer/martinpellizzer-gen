It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often fragrant flowers that resemble pipes, typically in shades of purple and green. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. However, it contains toxic compounds and is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
