    "intro": "Alchemilla scheuchzeri, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is known for its ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in harsh mountain environments. Alchemilla scheuchzeri is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
