    "intro": "Aspidium apicale, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its robust, evergreen rhizomes and simple, linear to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The fronds are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with the terminal frond being the largest and most prominent. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium apicale is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices."
