    "intro": "Astragalus australis var. aboriginorum, commonly known as the Central Australian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of Australia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, hairy stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spiny pods. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is of cultural significance to Indigenous Australian communities, reflecting its historical and ecological importance in the region."
