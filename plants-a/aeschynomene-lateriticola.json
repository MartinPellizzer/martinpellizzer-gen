It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is well adapted to poor soil conditions, often growing in lateritic soils, which are rich in iron and aluminum. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
