    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina proles angustifoliola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, arranged in loose clusters atop the stems. Its foliage is often used in herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates."
