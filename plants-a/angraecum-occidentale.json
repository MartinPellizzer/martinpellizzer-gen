    "intro": "Angraecum occidentale, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is a epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other objects without being parasitic. The plant produces striking white or pale blue flowers with long, slender petals and a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Angraecum occidentale is notable for its unique floral structure and its historical significance in the study of adaptive evolution."
