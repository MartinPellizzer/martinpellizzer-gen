    "intro": "Agrimonia lanata, commonly known as the downy agrimony, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Agrimonia lanata is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
