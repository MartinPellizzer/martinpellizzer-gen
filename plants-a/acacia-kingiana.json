    "intro": "Acacia kingiana, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Acacia kingiana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage and seasonal flowering.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia kingiana is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in the Kalahari Desert and surrounding areas, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can often be seen growing along roadsides and in open savannas. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Due to its resilience, it is also sometimes cultivated in other parts of the world with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kingiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the introduction of exotic plants for horticultural and ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and has become naturalized in some regions. However, it is considered a potential weed in certain environments due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
