    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon bodeanum is primarily native to Iran. It is found in specific regions within the country, particularly in the central and eastern parts. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in mountainous areas. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches that provide the necessary conditions for its growth. It is an important part of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon bodeanum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is typically found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in open woodlands, and in grasslands. This plant thrives in environments with low moisture and moderate temperatures. Its distribution is limited by its intolerance to heavy clay soils and high humidity. It is considered a rare and localized species in its native range."
