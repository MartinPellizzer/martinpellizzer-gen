    "intro": "Amorgine, commonly known as the \"buttercup\" or \"false buttercup,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It is characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers with five petals and a distinctive central stigma. The leaves are typically palmately divided, with a smooth or hairy surface, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Amorgine species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
