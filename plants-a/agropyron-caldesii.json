    "intro": "Agropyron caldesii, commonly known as the alpine wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Agropyron caldesii is well adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and poor soils, making it a hardy species. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
