It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Aurinia petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
