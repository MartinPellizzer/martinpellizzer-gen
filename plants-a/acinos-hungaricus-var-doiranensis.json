It is a perennial herbaceous plant with a rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in a single head. It thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
