This variety is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. It thrives in sunny environments with well-drained soils, making it a common sight in sandy or rocky areas. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value. Its native range is limited to these specific island groups, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha insulana var. glabrescens was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the islands. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
