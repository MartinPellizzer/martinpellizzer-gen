    "intro": "Arnica mollis var. aspera, commonly known as the rough mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and grasslands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
