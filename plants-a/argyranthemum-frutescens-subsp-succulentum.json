    "intro": "Argyranthemum frutescens subsp. succulentum, commonly known as the silverleaf arnica, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
