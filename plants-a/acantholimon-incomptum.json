    "intro": "Acantholimon incomptum, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, blue-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray and strong winds. Acantholimon incomptum is an important species for stabilizing dune ecosystems and supporting local pollinator populations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon incomptum is primarily native to Iran. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. This plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing in mountainous areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to specific ecological zones within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon incomptum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes, coastal bluffs, and disturbed sites. It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas of western North America. This plant is adapted to dry, arid conditions and can tolerate salt spray, making it suitable for coastal environments. It is often seen growing in association with other drought-tolerant species in these ecosystems. Its introduction has been noted in several states, including California, Oregon, and Washington, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed landscapes."
