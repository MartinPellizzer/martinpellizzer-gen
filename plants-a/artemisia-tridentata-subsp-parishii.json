It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic leaves, which contain essential oils. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in summer. This subspecies is important for wildlife habitat and has been used traditionally by Indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
