    "intro": "Astragalus echinus var. chionistrae, commonly known as the snow-haired milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are typically compound, with small, needle-like leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
