    "intro": "Acmella caulirhiza, commonly known as the shield flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling a crown. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. Acmella caulirhiza is also noted for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies.",
