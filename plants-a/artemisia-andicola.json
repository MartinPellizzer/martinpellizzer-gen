    "intro": "Artemisia andicola, commonly known as the Andean wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in rocky or alpine soils. It contains volatile oils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Due to its ecological significance and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
