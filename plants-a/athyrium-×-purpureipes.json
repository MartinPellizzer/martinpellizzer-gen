    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 purpureipes, commonly known as the purple fern, is a hybrid fern species that combines traits from its parent species, Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed, bi-colored fronds that often display a mix of green and purple hues. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. The fronds are usually deciduous, with the leaves unfurling in a distinctive, cascading manner during the growing season."
