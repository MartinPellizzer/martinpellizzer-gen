    "intro": "Amblyachyrum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant features a unique, elongated stem with clusters of small, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, Amblyachyrum is considered endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
