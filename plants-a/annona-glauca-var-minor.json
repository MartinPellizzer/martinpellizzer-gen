    "intro": "Annona glauca var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf soursop, is a compact variant of the soursop tree. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas and thrives in warm, humid climates. The plant produces small, round fruits with a smooth, green skin and a sweet, aromatic pulp. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a velvety texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than the standard soursop."
