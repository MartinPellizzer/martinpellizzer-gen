    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in moist, temperate environments. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense turf. It is widely used in turfgrass management due to its durability and aesthetic appeal."
