It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of rounded, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, panicle-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
