    "intro": "Alsophila acrostichoides, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Alsophila acrostichoides plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
