    "intro": "Aeschynomene mimulosa, commonly known as the yellow sesban, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Aeschynomene mimulosa is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some regions for forage and traditional medicine."
