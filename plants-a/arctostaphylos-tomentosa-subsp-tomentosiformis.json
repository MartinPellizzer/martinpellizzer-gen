    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. tomentosiformis, commonly known as the gray mountain maple, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous and forested regions. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory in its native habitats."
