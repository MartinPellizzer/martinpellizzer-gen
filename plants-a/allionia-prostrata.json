    "intro": "Allionia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate allionia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is popular among gardeners interested in native flora."
