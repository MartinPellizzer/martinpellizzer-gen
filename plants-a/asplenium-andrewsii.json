    "intro": "Asplenium andrewsii, commonly known as the rock brake, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky, shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are finely toothed along the edges. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in crevices. Asplenium andrewsii is well adapted to low-light conditions and can thrive in moist, calcareous soils."
