    "intro": "Aster exsul, commonly known as the slender aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinct appearance. Aster exsul plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in conservation areas due to its declining population."
