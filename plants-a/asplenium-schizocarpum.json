    "intro": "Asplenium schizocarpum, commonly known as the veined spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a prominent midrib and fine veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium schizocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy and adaptable nature."
