    "intro": "Angelica anomala var. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Siberian angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to the northern regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a complex umbel, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. This variant is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to other angelica species."
