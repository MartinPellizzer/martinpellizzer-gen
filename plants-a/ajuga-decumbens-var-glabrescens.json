    "intro": "Ajuga decumbens var. glabrescens, commonly known as carpet bugle or silver bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with spreading stems that root at the nodes, creating dense ground cover. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its foliage is characterized by heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often silver or gray-green in appearance. It is well-suited for erosion control and ornamental use in shaded garden settings."
