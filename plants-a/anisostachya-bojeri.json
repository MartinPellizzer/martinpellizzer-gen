    "intro": "Anisostachya bojeri, commonly known as Bojer's grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
