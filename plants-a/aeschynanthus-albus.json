    "intro": "Aeschynanthus albus, commonly known as the white-flowered ivy creeper, is a member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a contrasting purple or red throat. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus albus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
