    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. capitata, commonly known as the clustered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, cold environments and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are usually succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. The flowers bloom in late summer, contributing to the plant's role in stabilizing soil in its ecological niche."
