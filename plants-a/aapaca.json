    "intro": "Aapaca, commonly known as the sacred orchid, is a rare and ethically significant plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant is often cultivated in controlled environments due to its sensitivity to environmental changes and its cultural importance in local traditions. Its roots are valued for their medicinal properties, used in traditional healing practices. However, overharvesting has led to its decline, prompting conservation efforts to protect this unique species."
