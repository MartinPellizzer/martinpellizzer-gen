    "intro": "Apium graveolens var. dulce, commonly known as celery, is a biennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots and stalks are widely used in cooking for their distinct, crisp texture and mild, slightly peppery flavor. Celery thrives in cool climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
