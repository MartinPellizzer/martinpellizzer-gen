    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its oblong, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant is an aquatic or semi-aquatic fern, often found in shallow water or moist environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in controlled aquatic settings."
