    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. grandiflora, commonly known as greater agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, winged fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts. Agrimony is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been historically used in herbal medicine."
