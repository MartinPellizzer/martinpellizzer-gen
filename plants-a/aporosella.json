    "intro": "Aporosella, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Aporosella lacks true leaves and instead relies on its roots for photosynthesis, making it highly specialized. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
