It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are thick and often hairy. Arctium antonowii is valued for its medicinal properties, with its roots traditionally used in herbal remedies."
