    "intro": "Anoniodes schumannii, commonly known as the Schumann's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. This epiphytic plant grows on trees and relies on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small, white, and emit a faint fragrance, typically blooming during the dry season. Due to habitat destruction and its elusive nature, it is considered critically endangered and is rarely seen in the wild."
