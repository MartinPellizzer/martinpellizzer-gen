    "intro": "Atalaya australis, commonly known as the Australian atalaya, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Atalaya australis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
