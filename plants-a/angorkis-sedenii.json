    "intro": "Angorkis sedenii, commonly known as the golden spire orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Angorkis sedenii thrives in cool, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and threatened status, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
