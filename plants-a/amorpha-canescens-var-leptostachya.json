It features compound leaves with oval to lance-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing abilities, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. The variety leptostachya is distinguished by its more elongated floral clusters compared to the typical form."
