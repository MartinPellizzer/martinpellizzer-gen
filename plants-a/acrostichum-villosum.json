    "intro": "Acrostichum villosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or near streams. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have two levels of division, giving it a feathery appearance. Acrostichum villosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in humid, well-drained soils.",
