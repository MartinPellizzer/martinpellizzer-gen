    "intro": "Artemisia potens, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-green foliage and small, yellowish flower heads that resemble tiny cones. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in dry, rocky soils. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. Due to its chemical composition, it has been traditionally used in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
