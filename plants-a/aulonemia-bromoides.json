    "intro": "Aulonemia bromoides, commonly known as the common aulonemia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth, waxy texture. Its flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences and are usually pink to purple in color. Aulonemia bromoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
