    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. nigricalycis, commonly known as black-barked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves and small, yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It is adapted to dry environments and has a deep root system to access water. This variety is distinguished by its dark, almost black calyces, which give it its common name."
