    "intro": "Artemisia kumykorum, commonly known as the Caucasian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features silver-gray foliage due to its dense covering of fine hairs, and its aromatic leaves emit a distinctive, camphor-like scent. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
