    "intro": "Ajax lusitanicus, commonly known as the Portuguese sword fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its sword-shaped, evergreen fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
