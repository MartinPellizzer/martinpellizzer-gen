    "intro": "Astragalus xanthotrichos, commonly known as the yellow-haired milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves with yellowish hairs and small, yellow to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native habitat."
