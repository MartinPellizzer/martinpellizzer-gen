    "intro": "Acer campestre subsp. leiocarpum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its oval, glossy, dark green leaves that remain smooth and hairless on both sides. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by spiny, orange-brown fruits. Its bark is typically smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age. This subspecies is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens.",

Balkan Pen., Poland, Switzerland, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This subspecies is found across a range that spans Central and Eastern Europe, as well as parts of the Middle East. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas and along river valleys. The distribution includes both mountainous and lowland regions, reflecting its adaptability to various environmental conditions. Its presence in these regions highlights its ecological significance in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre subsp. leiocarpum was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has been widely planted in urban and rural landscapes across the country. The species is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its popularity, its ecological impact remains a topic of ongoing study."
