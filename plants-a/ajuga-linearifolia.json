    "intro": "Ajuga linearifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features dark green, elongated leaves that are typically less than an inch wide, arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a useful ground cover in shaded gardens."
