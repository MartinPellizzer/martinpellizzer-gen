    "intro": "Astragalus ervoides, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with numerous small leaflets, and it produces legume pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus ervoides plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
