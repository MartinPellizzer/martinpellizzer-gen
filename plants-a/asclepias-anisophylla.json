    "intro": "Asclepias anisophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hooded structures called corona, which are typical of the milkweed genus. Asclepias anisophylla is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds, and it plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats."
