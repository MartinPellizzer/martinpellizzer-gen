    "intro": "Alopecurus palustris subsp. bulbosus, commonly known as the bulblet marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tufted growth habit with slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale blue to greenish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and it has bulbous structures at the base of the stem that aid in storage and propagation. This subspecies is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
