    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies religiosa var. glaucescens is primarily native to the western Himalayas, specifically in regions of India, Nepal, and northern Pakistan. This variant of the Himalayan fir is commonly found in elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mountainous and subalpine forests. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of high-altitude environments, making it a characteristic species of the region's temperate forests. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of the Himalayan range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies religiosa var. glaucescens was mainly introduced to areas with mild climates and well-drained soils, often in regions where it is cultivated for ornamental purposes. It is commonly found in gardens and parks in the southern United States, particularly in Texas and California. This variety is known for its attractive blue-green foliage and compact growth habit. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires moderate water during the growing season. Due to its hardiness, it has become a popular choice for landscaping in urban and suburban settings."
