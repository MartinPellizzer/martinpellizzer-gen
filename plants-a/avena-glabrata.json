    "intro": "Avena glabrata, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue. Avena glabrata is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
