    "intro": "Atriplex corrugata, commonly known as the creased saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its rough, corrugated leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt marshes. Atriplex corrugata plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
