    "intro": "Ampliglossum isopterum, commonly known as the winged bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features striking, winged petals that give it its common name, with flowers typically ranging from blue to purple in color. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and blooms during the cooler months. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and native plant collections."
