    "intro": "Andropogon pappii, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, a feature that gives it its common name. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in prairie and open woodland habitats. Sand bluestem is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
