    "intro": "Astragalus sirinicus subsp. genargenteus, commonly known as the silver-haired milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are typically compound, with several pairs of leaflets that are often covered in a silvery or whitish pubescence. This subspecies thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies in arid ecosystems."
