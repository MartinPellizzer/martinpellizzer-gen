    "intro": "Agropyron orientale subsp. distans, commonly known as the western wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, making it a valuable species for soil stabilization and forage. Its deep root system helps prevent erosion and contributes to soil health in degraded landscapes."
