    "intro": "Aspidium lifuense, commonly known as the Lifu fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sorangia, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Aspidium lifuense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
