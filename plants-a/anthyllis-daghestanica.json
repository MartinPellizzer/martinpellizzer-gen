    "intro": "Anthyllis daghestanica, commonly known as the Daghestan clover, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region, particularly Russia and Georgia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to mountainous environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Anthyllis daghestanica plays a role in soil fixation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
