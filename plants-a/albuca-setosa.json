    "intro": "Albuca setosa, commonly known as the woolly albuca, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Albuca setosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
