It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, doubly serrated leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic nature, it should be handled with care.",
