    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea subsp. messenica, commonly known as the Messenian Orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found primarily in southern Greece. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers with a distinctive white lip, which are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms. The plant typically grows in calcareous soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded habitats. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system, and its leaves are linear and grass-like. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
