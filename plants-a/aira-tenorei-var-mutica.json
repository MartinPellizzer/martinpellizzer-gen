    "intro": "Aira tenorei var. mutica, commonly known as the woolly airgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, silver-green foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, coastal environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
