    "intro": "Aspasia lunata var. superba, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 12 inches in length, often floating on the water's surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value to ponds and wetlands. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving waters with abundant sunlight and is often used in water garden designs. Its rapid growth makes it both a popular choice for aquatic landscaping and a potential invasive species if not managed carefully."
