    "intro": "Arisaema polyphyllum, commonly known as the multileaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous stem with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, hood-shaped spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in humid climates."
