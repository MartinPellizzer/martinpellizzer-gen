    "intro": "Angraecum teres, commonly known as the slender star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, slender stems and small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, with long, tubular nectar spurs that match the proboscis of its specific pollinators. Angraecum teres is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and limited distribution."
