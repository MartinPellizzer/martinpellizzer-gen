    "intro": "Axonopus argentinus var. genuinus, commonly known as the Argentine axonopus, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to South America. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in horticultural applications for ground cover. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental and a potential invasive species in some areas. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves."
