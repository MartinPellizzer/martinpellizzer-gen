    "intro": "Aulacolepis epileuca, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy stems and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in dense clusters during the cooler months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Aulacolepis epileuca plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often used in xerophytic gardens."
