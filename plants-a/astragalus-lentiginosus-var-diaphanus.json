    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. diaphanus, commonly known as the ghost milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization. The species is notable for its distinctive, pale coloration and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation to harsh climates."
