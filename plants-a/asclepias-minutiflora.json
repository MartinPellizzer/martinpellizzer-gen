    "intro": "Asclepias minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which are characteristic of the milkweed genus. Asclepias minutiflora is notable for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands."
