    "intro": "Acalypha levinii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf acalypha, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety texture, often with a silver or grayish hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by three-lobed, maple-like seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Acalypha levinii is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",

It thrives in a range of habitats, such as forests, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is well adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of Madagascar. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered endemic to the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha levinii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain regions. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting management efforts to control its spread."
