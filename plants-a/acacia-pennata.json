    "intro": "Acacia pennata, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Acacia pennata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its resilience to drought. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including as a source of tannins.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pennata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Philippines. Acacia pennata is an important plant in local ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pennata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and clearings. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
