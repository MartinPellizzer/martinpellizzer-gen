It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals that form a wheel-like pattern, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and are typically deeply lobed. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is adapted to well-drained, alkaline soils."
