    "intro": "Achillea asiatica var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact, low-growing structure with a fibrous root system and basal leaves that are linear to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with similar conditions.",
