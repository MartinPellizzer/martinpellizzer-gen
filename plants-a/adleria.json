These plants are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are typically white or pale blue in color. Adleria species are native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe and Asia. They often grow in moist, woodland habitats and are valued for their ornamental appeal. The leaves are usually alternate and lance-shaped, with some species having hairy surfaces."
