    "intro": "Astragalus mohavensis var. hemigyrus, commonly known as the Mohave milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils in desert regions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss. The species is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a hardy component of desert flora."
