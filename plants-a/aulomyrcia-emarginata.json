    "intro": "Aulomyrcia emarginata, commonly known as the Margined Aulomyrcia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
