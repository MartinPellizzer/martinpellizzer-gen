It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist to saturated soil conditions. It is a herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to 2 feet, with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The genus Ammannia is part of the family Lythraceae, which includes other flowering plants such as the poinsettia and the common willow."
