    "intro": "Alafia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that exhibit a distinctive network of veins, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Alafia reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
