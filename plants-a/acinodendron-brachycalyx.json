    "intro": "Acinodendron brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody structure. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",
