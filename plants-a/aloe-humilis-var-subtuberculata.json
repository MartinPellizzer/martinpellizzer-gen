It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in small, tuberculate bumps, giving it a textured appearance. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tinge and can grow up to 20 cm in length. It produces yellowish-green flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the summer months. This species is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
