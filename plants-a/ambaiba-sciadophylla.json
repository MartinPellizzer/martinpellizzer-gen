    "intro": "Ambaiba sciadophylla, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, woody, often spiny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Ambaiba sciadophylla plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
