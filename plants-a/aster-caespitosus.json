    "intro": "Aster caespitosus, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces striking purple or blue-violet flowers in the summer. The plant is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray florets and disk florets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for native gardens. Aster caespitosus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
