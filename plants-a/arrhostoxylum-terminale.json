    "intro": "Arrhostoxylum terminale, commonly known as the Andean thornapple, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans but are used by some animals as a food source. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Due to its ecological importance and unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
