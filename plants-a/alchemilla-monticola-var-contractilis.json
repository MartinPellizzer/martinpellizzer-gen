    "intro": "Alchemilla monticola var. contractilis, commonly known as the compact alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are silver-green in color, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in marginal conditions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
