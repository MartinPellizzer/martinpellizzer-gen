It is commonly found in temperate forests and rocky slopes at high altitudes. This subspecies thrives in cool, humid climates with well-drained soil. Its distribution is closely associated with the temperate zones of these countries. It is particularly prevalent in the northeastern parts of China, such as Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax senticosus f. subinermis was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. This subspecies is commonly found in forested areas and rocky slopes, preferring moderate to high elevations. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional Chinese medicine. The plant's distribution has expanded due to human activity and trade, leading to its presence in various parts of Asia. However, its introduction to new regions has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts."
