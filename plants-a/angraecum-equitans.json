It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom at night, attracting sphinx moths as pollinators. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are typically dark green and strap-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid habitat. Angraecum equitans is also noted for its slow growth and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a prized specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
