    "intro": "Anemone pseudoaltaica f. prolifera, commonly known as the Siberian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has a short, stout stem with palmately divided, lobed leaves that are hairy and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. This variety is noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies that are both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
