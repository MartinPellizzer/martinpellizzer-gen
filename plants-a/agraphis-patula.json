    "intro": "Agraphis patula, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouseear, is a small, mat-forming perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Compositae (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clustered heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges. Agraphis patula is known for its ability to tolerate shade and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
