    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. gracilis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a variant of a perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like blades and a low-growing habit, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its fine texture and adaptability, it is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping."
