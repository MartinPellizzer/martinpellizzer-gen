    "intro": "Alliaria unijuga, commonly known as the single-lobed garlic mustard, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers and has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy to the touch. It is often found in woodland areas and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Alliaria unijuga is also known for its strong garlic-like odor, which comes from compounds in its leaves and flowers."
