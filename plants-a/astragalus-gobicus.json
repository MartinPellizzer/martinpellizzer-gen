    "intro": "Astragalus gobicus, commonly known as goat's head, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and distinctive, spiny seed pods. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. Astragalus gobicus is often found in disturbed soils and can be an invasive species in some areas."
