    "intro": "Andinia rosea, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its striking pink and white petals, which resemble those of orchids, though it belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Andinia rosea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in Andean communities."
