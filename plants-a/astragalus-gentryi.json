    "intro": "Astragalus gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus gentryi is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen and supporting local biodiversity."
