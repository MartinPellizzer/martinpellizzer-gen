    "intro": "Adesmia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved burro bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Adesmia trifoliata is drought-tolerant and has adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions.",
