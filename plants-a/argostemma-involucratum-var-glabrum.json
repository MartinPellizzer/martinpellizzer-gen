    "intro": "Argostemma involucratum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth argostemma, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Araceae, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually broad and lanceolate, with a smooth texture that gives the variety its name. The flowers are small and clustered, often white or greenish, and play a role in attracting pollinators like insects."
