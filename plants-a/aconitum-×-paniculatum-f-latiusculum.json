    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 paniculatum f. latiusculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a deeply veined structure, and its stems are usually erect and covered in fine hairs. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
