    "intro": "Ananas silvestris, commonly known as the wild pineapple, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiky, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a unique, spiky fruit that resembles a pineapple, though it is not related to the cultivated pineapple. The fruit is edible, with a tart and slightly sweet flavor, and is often used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
