It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and produces striking spikes of blue to violet flowers in the summer. The plant is often found in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is covered in fine, stiff hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
