    "intro": "Aphyteia hydnora, commonly known as the common hydnora, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of other plants. The plant is notable for its lack of stems, leaves, and true roots, with its entire structure consisting of a fleshy, often foul-smelling flower. It produces a unique, white, fleshy inflorescence that resembles a fungus, which attracts specific insect pollinators. Due to its subterranean growth and limited visibility, it is one of the least studied plants in the region."
