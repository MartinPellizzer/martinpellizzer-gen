    "intro": "Asperula pendula var. concatenata, commonly known as the hanging azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It features delicate, pendulous clusters of pink to white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has slender, arching stems that cascade gracefully from its base, creating a weeping appearance. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the floral display. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
