    "intro": "Asplenium affine var. gilpiniae, commonly known as the Gilpin's shield fern, is a rare and unique variant of the common shield fern. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in low light conditions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
