    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 kamiaranensis, commonly known as the Japanese almond, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Prunus davidiana and Prunus mandshurica. It is native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan and is characterized by its ornamental value due to its fragrant flowers and attractive foliage. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. The fruit is a drupe, containing a single seed enclosed in a hard shell, similar to other members of the Prunus genus."
