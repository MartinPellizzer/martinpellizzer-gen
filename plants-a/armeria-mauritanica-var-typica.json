    "intro": "Armeria mauritanica var. typica, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and northern Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly salt-tolerant, making it well adapted to harsh maritime environments. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
