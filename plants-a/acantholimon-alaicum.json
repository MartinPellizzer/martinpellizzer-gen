    "intro": "Acantholimon alaicum, commonly known as the Alpine thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in sparse vegetation. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Kirgizstan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon alaicum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly found in regions with limited rainfall and high solar exposure. This plant thrives in environments with well-drained soil and is often seen in alpine and subalpine zones. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Central Asia. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
