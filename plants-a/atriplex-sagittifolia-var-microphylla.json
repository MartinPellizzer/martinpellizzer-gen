    "intro": "Atriplex sagittifolia var. microphylla, commonly known as shadscale, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Shadscale is a hardy, drought-tolerant species that plays an important role in stabilizing soil in arid ecosystems."
