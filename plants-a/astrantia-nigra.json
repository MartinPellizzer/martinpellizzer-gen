    "intro": "Astrantia nigra, commonly known as black dead-nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive umbel of small, dark purple to black flowers. The plant blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astrantia nigra thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and unique flower structure."
