    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rugosulum is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. It is commonly found in savanna and woodland habitats, often growing along riverbanks and in open grasslands. This plant thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is adapted to seasonal rainfall patterns. It is also known to occur in parts of the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa. Its native range extends into some areas of Madagascar as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rugosulum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and forest edges. This species has been reported in Washington, Oregon, and northern California. It is considered an invasive plant in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded in recent decades, raising concerns among land managers and conservationists."
