    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. breviscapa, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically rounded and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in disturbed alpine habitats."
