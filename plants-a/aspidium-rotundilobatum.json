    "intro": "Aspidium rotundilobatum, commonly known as the round-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping rhizomes that help it spread across wetlands and marshy areas. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium rotundilobatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
