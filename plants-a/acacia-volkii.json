    "intro": "Acacia volkii, commonly known as the Volk's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched trunk and dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces long, flat pods that contain hard, angular seeds. It has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Its leaves are typically small and feathery, reducing water loss through transpiration.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia volkii is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and Ethiopia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and on limestone formations. This plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is often seen in scrublands and along rocky outcrops. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for local wildlife. Acacia volkii is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia volkii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in semi-arid and arid areas, particularly in the Western Cape and Northern Cape provinces. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny structure. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world, including Australia and the United States, as an ornamental species. However, its introduction outside its native range has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in new ecosystems."
