The plant has tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-rowed flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
