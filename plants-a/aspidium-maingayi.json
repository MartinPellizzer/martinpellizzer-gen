    "intro": "Aspidium maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically divided into small, oval-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight and nutrients. Its rhizomes spread along the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating vegetative propagation. Aspidium maingayi plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
