    "intro": "Adiantum tenuissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fertile fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soil. Adiantum tenuissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings.",
