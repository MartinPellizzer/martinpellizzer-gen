    "intro": "Alnus arguta var. ovata, commonly known as the ovate alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its ovate, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria. The wood is lightweight and used in various traditional applications, though it is not as commercially significant as other alder species."
