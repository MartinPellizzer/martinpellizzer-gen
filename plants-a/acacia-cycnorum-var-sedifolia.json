    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cycnorum var. sedifolia is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. It is commonly found in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions, often growing in open woodlands and along roadsides. This variant is adapted to thrive in sandy and rocky soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments. It is also present in parts of Pakistan and Bangladesh. The plant is well-known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fodder.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cycnorum var. sedifolia was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and as a forage plant in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in rehabilitation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its introduction has been widespread in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. However, it has occasionally become invasive in some regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
