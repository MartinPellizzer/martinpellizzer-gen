    "intro": "Aristolochia pyrenea, commonly known as the purple swallowwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial vine characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and showy, pipe-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain toxic seeds, making it a concern in some regions due to its invasive potential. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique floral structure and medicinal historical use have made it a subject of both botanical and ecological study."
