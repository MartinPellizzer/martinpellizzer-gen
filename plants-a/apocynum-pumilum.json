    "intro": "Apocynum pumilum, commonly known as the small milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features erect, hairy stems that are often branched and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with slightly serrated edges and are arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant contains a milky sap, which is characteristic of the Apocynaceae family and can be toxic if ingested."
