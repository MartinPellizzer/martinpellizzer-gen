    "intro": "Arachniodes duplicatoserrata, commonly known as the double-toothed forest fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with double-serrate margins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil substrates. The leaves are evergreen during the growing season but shed in winter, contributing to the plant's seasonal appearance."
