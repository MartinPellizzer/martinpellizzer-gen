    "intro": "Atriplex tenuissima, commonly known as green burro bush, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Atriplex tenuissima is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
