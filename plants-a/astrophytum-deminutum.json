    "intro": "Astrophytum deminutum, commonly known as the miniature star cactus, is a small, globular cactus native to the Sonoran Desert of the United States and Mexico. It has a compact, rounded shape with a short, thick stem and a dense covering of spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically short-lived. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy stem and having a shallow root system. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
