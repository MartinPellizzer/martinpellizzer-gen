    "intro": "Aspidium huberi, commonly known as the European water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Water ferns (Pteridaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, almost lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Aspidium huberi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and soil conditions."
