    "intro": "Alisma difformifolium, commonly known as the variable arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in moist, muddy substrates. The plant has arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often variegated, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, emerging on slender stems above the water surface. Alisma difformifolium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
