    "intro": "Asclepias browniana, commonly known as Brown's milkweed, is a species of milkweed native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and pairs of opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milkweed sap contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias browniana plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a key plant in the life cycle of monarch butterflies."
