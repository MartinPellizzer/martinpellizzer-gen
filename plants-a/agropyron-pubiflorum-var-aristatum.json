    "intro": "Agropyron pubiflorum var. aristatum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered with short, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental and forage qualities."
