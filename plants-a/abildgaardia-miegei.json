    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia miegei is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries such as Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soils. This plant is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic regions due to its particular environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia miegei was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was first documented in Oregon in the early 20th century as an ornamental plant. The species has since spread to other parts of the West Coast, including California and Washington. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils near water sources. Due to its invasive potential, it is now monitored in several conservation areas."
