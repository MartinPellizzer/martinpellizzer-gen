    "intro": "Acaena multifida var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous burr bush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny growth and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spherical, woody fruits that contain seeds surrounded by hooked bracts. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming dense thickets. Due to its robust growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. glaberrima is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the regions of Otago and Southland. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as tussock grasslands and rocky outcrops. It is commonly associated with areas that have well-drained soils and a temperate climate. The plant is part of the bramble family and is known for its distinctive, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida var. glaberrima was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced intentionally for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some areas. Its distribution is now primarily limited to the northern regions of New Zealand."
