It features striking blue to purple composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of silver-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
