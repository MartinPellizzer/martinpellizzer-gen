    "intro": "Adenosacme cauliflora, commonly known as the climbing adenosacme, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its climbing habit and the presence of stipules that are often leaf-like. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne along the stems rather than at the ends of branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a rough texture. Adenosacme cauliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique growth form.",
