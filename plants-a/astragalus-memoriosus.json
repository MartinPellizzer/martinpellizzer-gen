    "intro": "Astragalus memoriosus, commonly known as the memory pea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and rocky habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Astragalus memoriosus is considered a delicate species with limited distribution."
