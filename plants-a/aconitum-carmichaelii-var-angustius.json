    "intro": "Aconitum carmichaelii var. angustius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are narrower than those of the typical A. carmichaelii. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. However, it is highly toxic, containing potent alkaloids that can be dangerous to humans and animals.",
