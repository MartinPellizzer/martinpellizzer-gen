    "intro": "Aralia finlaysoniana, commonly known as the Finlayson's aralia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically palmate and can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, which are followed by berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its native range."
