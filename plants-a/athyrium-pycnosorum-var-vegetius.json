    "intro": "Athyrium pycnosorum var. vegetius, commonly known as the dense-ferns, is a variant of the Japanese forest fern. It is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a lush, carpet-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with finely divided, needle-like segments. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
