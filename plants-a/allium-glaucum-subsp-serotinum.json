    "intro": "Allium glaucum subsp. serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in late summer. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its bulbous stem is used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb, similar to other Allium species. The subspecies is distinguished by its delayed flowering compared to other members of the Allium glaucum complex."
