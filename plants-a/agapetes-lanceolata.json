    "intro": "Agapetes lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate silverleaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery or whitish pubescence. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments at high altitudes, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces berries that are edible for certain bird species. Agapetes lanceolata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
