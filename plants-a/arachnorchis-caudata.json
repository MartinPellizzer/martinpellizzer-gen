    "intro": "Arachnorchis caudata, commonly known as the long-tailed spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to southeastern Australia. It features a slender, wiry stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces a single, elongated spike bearing several pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern of markings. Its flowers are typically 2\u20133 cm in length and have a unique, spider-like appearance, which gives it its common name. Arachnorchis caudata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the trunks of rainforest trees."
