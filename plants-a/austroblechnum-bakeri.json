    "intro": "Austroblechnum bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's hart's-tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its narrow, strap-like fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor to rocky or soil substrates. Austroblechnum bakeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
