It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette, often with a silvery or grayish hue. Astelia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock gardens. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
