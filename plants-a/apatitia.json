    "intro": "Apatitia, commonly known as water dock, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are perennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, and they produce yellow or orange flowers in composite inflorescences. Apatitia species are often found in wet or moist soils, such as along stream banks or in marshy areas. Some species have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
