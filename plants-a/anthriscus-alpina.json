    "intro": "Anthriscus alpina, commonly known as mountain parsley, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Anthriscus alpina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
