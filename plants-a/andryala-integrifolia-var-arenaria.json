It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like leaves and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
