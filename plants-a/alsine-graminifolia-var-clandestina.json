    "intro": "Alsine graminifolia var. clandestina, commonly known as the secret grass, is a rare and elusive plant species characterized by its low-growing, grass-like appearance. It typically features slender, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
