    "intro": "Arenaria aggregata var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, densely packed, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth habit with tiny, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments."
