    "intro": "Aloe lateritia, commonly known as the Socotra aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Socotra in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery substance called farina. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellowish-green flowers. Aloe lateritia is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive long dry periods. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a notable species in botanical studies."
