    "intro": "Ateleia chicoasensis, commonly known as the Chicoasense Sycamore, is a small tree native to Mexico, specifically the state of Chiapas. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, clustered flowers and fruits that are edible, though not commonly consumed by humans. This species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
