    "intro": "Athyrium nigripes var. mearnsianum, commonly known as the Mearns' black fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fronds that are densely veined and leathery in texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodland floors and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and stout, supporting the upright, clustered growth habit. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteris and Athyrium genera."
