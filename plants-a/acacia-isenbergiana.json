    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia isenbergiana is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the eastern seaboard. This species thrives in coastal heathlands and dunes, often growing in well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions. Acacia isenbergiana is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its role in supporting local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia isenbergiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the introduction of exotic plant species for ornamental or ecological purposes. The plant is native to South Africa and has since become established in certain regions of New Zealand. It is often found in coastal and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. However, it is not considered invasive in New Zealand and is primarily used in landscaping and reforestation projects."
