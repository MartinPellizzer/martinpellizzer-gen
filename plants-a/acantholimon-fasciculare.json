    "intro": "Acantholimon fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered stonecress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Acantholimon fasciculare is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon fasciculare is primarily native to Afghanistan and Pakistan. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or foothill areas. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the broader biodiversity of Central Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon fasciculare was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of Mediterranean flora during the 19th century. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and subalpine areas. It is often found in gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Despite its introduction, it is not considered invasive and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
