    "intro": "Aquilegia nikolicii var. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancic's Columbine, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that range in color from deep red to violet, typical of the genus Aquilegia. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. Its foliage consists of basal leaves with deeply lobed blades, and it produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
