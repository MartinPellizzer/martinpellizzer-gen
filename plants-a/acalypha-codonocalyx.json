    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha codonocalyx is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with rainforests and secondary vegetation. It is also present in parts of Indonesia and the Indian subcontinent. Acalypha codonocalyx is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha codonocalyx was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique flowering patterns. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been popular in landscaping and as a potted plant because of its adaptability to various growing conditions. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
