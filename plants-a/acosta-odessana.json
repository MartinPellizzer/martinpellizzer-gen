    "intro": "Acosta odessana, commonly known as the Odessa acosta, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of the United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or white. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of solanine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant flowers and drought tolerance.",
