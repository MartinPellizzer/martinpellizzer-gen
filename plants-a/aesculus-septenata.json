    "intro": "Aesculus septenata, commonly known as the Ohio buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its palmately compound leaves with seven leaflets, giving it its scientific name. The tree produces showy, yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters during early spring. Its fruit is a spiny capsule containing one or more seeds, which are encased in a chestnut-like husk. The Ohio buckeye is also notable for its ornamental value and historical significance in American culture."
