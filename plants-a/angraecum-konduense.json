    "intro": "Angraecum konduense, commonly known as the Konduense orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue with intricate patterns, and it produces a long, slender seed pod. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
