    "intro": "Asplenium goetzei var. majus, commonly known as the giant spleenwort, is a rare and elusive fern species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
