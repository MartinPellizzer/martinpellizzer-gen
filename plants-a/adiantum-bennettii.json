    "intro": "Adiantum bennettii, commonly known as the Bennett's maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique characteristic that aids in nighttime pollination.
