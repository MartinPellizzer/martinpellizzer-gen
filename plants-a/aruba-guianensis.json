    "intro": "Aruba guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese arum, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spatula-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
