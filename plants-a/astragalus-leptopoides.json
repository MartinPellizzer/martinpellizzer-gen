    "intro": "Astragalus leptopoides, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus leptopoides is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
