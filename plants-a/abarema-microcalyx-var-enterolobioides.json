    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema microcalyx var. enterolobioides is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This species thrives in humid tropical climates and is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. The plant is well adapted to the region's warm and wet conditions, making it a characteristic component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema microcalyx var. enterolobioides was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its introduction is often associated with human activities like agriculture and land clearing. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
