    "intro": "Aquilegia sibirica var. concolor, commonly known as the Siberian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the top of its upright stems. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical name reflects its geographic origin and its distinctive concolorous (uniform) flower color."
