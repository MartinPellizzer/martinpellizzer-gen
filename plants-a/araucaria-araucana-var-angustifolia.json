    "intro": "Araucaria araucana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved monkey puzzle tree, is a distinctive evergreen conifer native to central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its unique, spiky foliage and a tall, slender trunk that often grows in a straight, columnar form. The leaves are narrow, needle-like, and arranged in spirals along the branches, giving it a striking appearance. It produces cones that contain edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for indigenous peoples. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitat."
