    "intro": "Astragalus limnocharis, commonly known as the water milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has palmate leaves composed of several leaflets, which help it to efficiently capture sunlight in its aquatic or semi-aquatic environment. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist soils, often found along the edges of ponds and marshes. Astragalus limnocharis plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
