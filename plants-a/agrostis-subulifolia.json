    "intro": "Agrostis subulifolia, commonly known as the slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, moist habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, needle-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in width, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Agrostis subulifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
