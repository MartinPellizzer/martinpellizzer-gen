    "intro": "Alansmia laxa, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit and produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alansmia laxa is an important plant for supporting local wildlife and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
