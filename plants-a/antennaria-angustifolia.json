    "intro": "Antennaria angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf mouseear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white coating. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Antennaria angustifolia is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
