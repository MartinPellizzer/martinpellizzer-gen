    "intro": "Allium foetidum, commonly known as stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Its strong, pungent odor is a notable feature, which can be both a deterrent to herbivores and a distinguishing trait. Allium foetidum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal environments."
