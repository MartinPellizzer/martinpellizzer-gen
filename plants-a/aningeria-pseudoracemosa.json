    "intro": "Aningeria pseudoracemosa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds."
