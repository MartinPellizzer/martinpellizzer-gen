    "intro": "Alansmia concinna, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils in desert regions. The plant features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are generally narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Alansmia concinna is known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
