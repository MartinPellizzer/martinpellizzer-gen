    "intro": "Acinodendron suborbiculare, commonly known as the African rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often clustered at the base of the stems. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in furniture and musical instruments. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
