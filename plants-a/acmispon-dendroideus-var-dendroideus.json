    "intro": "Acmispon dendroideus var. dendroideus, commonly known as the tree burr medic, is a perennial leguminous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems that form a bushy structure, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by distinctive burr-like seed pods. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and as a forage plant in dryland ecosystems.",
