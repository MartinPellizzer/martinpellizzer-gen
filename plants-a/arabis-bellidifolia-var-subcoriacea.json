    "intro": "Arabis bellidifolia var. subcoriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture, giving it its botanical name \"subcoriacea.\" The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
