    "intro": "Aulonemia fulgor, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its vibrant, yellowish-green fronds that resemble flames. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Aulonemia fulgor is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its role in maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
