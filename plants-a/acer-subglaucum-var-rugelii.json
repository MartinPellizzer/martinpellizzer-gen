    "intro": "Acer subglaucum var. rugelii, commonly known as the Rugel's maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by paired samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",
