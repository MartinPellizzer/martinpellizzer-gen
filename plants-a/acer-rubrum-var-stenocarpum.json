    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit red maple, is a variant of the red maple tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, elongated fruits that differ from the typical broad fruits of the common red maple. The leaves are typically lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its unique fruiting habit and autumn color display.",
