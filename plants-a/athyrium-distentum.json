    "intro": "Athyrium distentum, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Athyrium distentum is valued for its delicate appearance and adaptability to various soil types."
