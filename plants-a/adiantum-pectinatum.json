    "intro": "Adiantum pectinatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Its fronds are covered in a fine, velvety layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture. Adiantum pectinatum is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable humidity and light conditions.",
