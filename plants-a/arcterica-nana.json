    "intro": "Arcterica nana, commonly known as the dwarf arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in short inflorescences. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in cold, windy environments. Arcterica nana plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for arctic wildlife."
