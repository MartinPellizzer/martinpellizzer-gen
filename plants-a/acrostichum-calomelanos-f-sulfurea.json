    "intro": "Acrostichum calomelanos f. sulfurea, commonly known as the sulfur-leaf fern, is a unique variant of the common cliff fern. This fern is characterized by its striking yellowish-green fronds, which give it a distinctive appearance compared to the typical green foliage of its parent species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are pinnately compound, with lance-shaped pinnae that are densely arranged along the rachis. This form is a natural variant, showcasing the genetic diversity within the Acrostichum genus."
