    "intro": "Acer oliverianum var. nakaharae, commonly known as the Nakahara maple, is a rare variant of the Oliver's maple native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically bright green in summer and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
