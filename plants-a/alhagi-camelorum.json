    "intro": "Alhagi camelorum, commonly known as goat's head, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that resemble a goat's head. The plant has small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or green pods that contain small, round seeds. It is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. Alhagi camelorum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in degraded areas."
