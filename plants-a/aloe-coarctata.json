    "intro": "Aloe coarctata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow, bluish-green leaves that are covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. It is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Aloe coarctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant."
