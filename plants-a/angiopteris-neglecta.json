    "intro": "Angiopteris neglecta, commonly known as the giant fern or the giant shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive, shield-shaped structure at the base of its fronds, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Angiopteris neglecta is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
