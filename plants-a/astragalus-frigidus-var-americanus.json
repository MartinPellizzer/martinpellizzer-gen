    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus var. americanus, commonly known as the American coldweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern United States and southern Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish-white flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its adaptability to cold climates makes it an important component of boreal and alpine ecosystems."
