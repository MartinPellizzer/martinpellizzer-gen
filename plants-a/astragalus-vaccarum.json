It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a deep taproot system, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Astragalus vaccarum is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for wildlife."
