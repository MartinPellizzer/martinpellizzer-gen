    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. maxima, commonly known as giant false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, grass-like foliage that can reach heights of up to six feet. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the tips of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of interest in ecological studies."
