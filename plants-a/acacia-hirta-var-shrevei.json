    "intro": "Acacia hirta var. shrevei, commonly known as the Shreve acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in compact, spherical clusters. The leaves are typically bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny, hair-like leaflets that give the plant a feathery appearance. This species is adapted to drought conditions, with a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hirta var. shrevei is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and northern Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including the Chihuahuan Desert. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and limited water availability. Its distribution is closely tied to the availability of suitable habitats in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hirta var. shrevei was mainly introduced to the southwestern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. This plant has been introduced as an ornamental due to its distinctive appearance and hardy nature. It is also used in reforestation efforts in regions with similar climatic conditions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems."
