    "intro": "Aspidium brunonianum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous roots, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas. The spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
