    "intro": "Athyrium spectabile, commonly known as the lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its graceful, feathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Athyrium spectabile is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
