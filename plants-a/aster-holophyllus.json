    "intro": "Aster holophyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has a bushy growth habit and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that give it a silvery appearance. Aster holophyllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
