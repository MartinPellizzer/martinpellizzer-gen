    "intro": "Alkanna orientalis var. integrifolia, commonly known as the Persian gum or Indian lac, is a perennial shrub native to the Middle East and South Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, pale green leaves that are usually entire, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its roots contain a resinous substance called alkannin, which is used in traditional medicine and as a natural dye. This species is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
