    "intro": "Abrotanella nivigena, commonly known as the snowplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its habitat. It thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant once established. Abrotanella nivigena is also known for its ability to survive in harsh coastal conditions, making it a characteristic species of coastal scrub ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanella nivigena is primarily native to New South Wales and Victoria. This species is commonly found in the temperate regions of southeastern Australia. It thrives in rocky outcrops and open habitats within these states. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of the area. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella nivigena was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions. It is typically spread through seeds carried by wind, water, or human activity. This plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species. It thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. Its introduction has led to concerns about ecological impact and habitat alteration in certain ecosystems."
