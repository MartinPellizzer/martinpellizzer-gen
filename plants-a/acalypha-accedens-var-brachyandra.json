    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha accedens var. brachyandra is primarily native to the Caribbean islands, including Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. This variant is typically found in moist, lowland areas with a tropical climate. It thrives in shaded to partially sunny environments, often near rivers or in forest understories. The plant is commonly associated with coastal regions and is sometimes found in disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific islands within the Greater Antilles.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha accedens var. brachyandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in disturbed soils and along streambanks. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its classification as a potential weed in some areas. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is still cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and public landscapes. Its introduction highlights the dual role of ornamental plants in both beautifying environments and posing ecological challenges."
