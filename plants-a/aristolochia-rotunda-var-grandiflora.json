    "intro": "Aristolochia rotunda var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a faintly veined interior. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and wasps. It thrives in moist, rich soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The genus Aristolochia is known for its complex chemical compounds, some of which have medicinal uses but can also be toxic."
