    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abroma wheleri is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Malaysia. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abroma wheleri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers. The plant has since spread beyond cultivation and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a weed in some areas because of its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
