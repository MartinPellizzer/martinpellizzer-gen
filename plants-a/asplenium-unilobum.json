    "intro": "Asplenium unilobum, commonly known as the single-lobed spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium unilobum is a hardy species that is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with the right conditions."
