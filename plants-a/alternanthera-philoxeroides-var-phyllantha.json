    "intro": "Alternanthera philoxeroides var. phyllantha, commonly known as red flame alternanthera, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red and pink foliage, which becomes more intense under full sun exposure. The plant has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats that can spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs. While it is valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic and wetland settings, it can become invasive in certain environments."
