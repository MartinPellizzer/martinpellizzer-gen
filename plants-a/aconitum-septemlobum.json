    "intro": "Aconitum septemlobum, commonly known as the seven-lobed monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features palmately lobed leaves with a deep green hue and a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas where children or pets are present.",
