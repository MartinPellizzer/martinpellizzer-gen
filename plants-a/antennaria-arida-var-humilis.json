    "intro": "Antennaria arida var. humilis, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. It is often found in disturbed areas and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
