    "intro": "Ampelopsis humulifolia var. heterophylla, commonly known as the variegated poison ivy, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, compound leaves that vary in shape and size along the stem, giving it the name \"heterophylla,\" which means \"different leaves.\" The leaves are typically green with yellow or white variegation, and they often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
