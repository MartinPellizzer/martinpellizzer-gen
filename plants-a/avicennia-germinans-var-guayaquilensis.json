    "intro": "Avicennia germinans var. guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Guayaquil mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant exhibits succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in coastal conditions. It is native to coastal regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Colombia. This variant plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and avian life."
