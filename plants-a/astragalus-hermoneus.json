    "intro": "Astragalus hermoneus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus hermoneus is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
