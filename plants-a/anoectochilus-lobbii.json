    "intro": "Anoectochilus lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers, which are typically borne on slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are usually oval or elliptic, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Anoectochilus lobbii is often found growing in forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake."
