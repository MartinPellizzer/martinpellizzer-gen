It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a strong, spicy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
