    "intro": "Asperula fragillima, commonly known as the fragile woodbine, is a delicate, climbing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features slender, twining stems with small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters of white or pale pink. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Due to its rarity and sensitivity to environmental changes, Asperula fragillima is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
