    "intro": "Atropa, commonly known as belladonna, is a toxic plant belonging to the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and striking bell-shaped flowers that are typically purplish-red in color. The plant produces berries that are initially green but turn bright red when mature, often mistaken for edible fruits. Belladonna contains potent alkaloids such as atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which have both medicinal and toxic properties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along the edges of forests."
