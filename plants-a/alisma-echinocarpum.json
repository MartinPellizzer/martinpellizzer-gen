    "intro": "Alisma echinocarpum, commonly known as the spiny bur reed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Its fruit is a spiny, three-lobed capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Alisma echinocarpum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
