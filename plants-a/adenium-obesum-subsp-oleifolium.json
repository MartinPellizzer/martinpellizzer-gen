    "intro": "Adenium obesum subsp. oleifolium, commonly known as the Desert Trumpet, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its swollen, bottle-shaped stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often lobed, adapting to reduce water loss. The subspecies is notable for its thick, milky sap, which contains toxic compounds and has been used traditionally in various cultural practices.",
