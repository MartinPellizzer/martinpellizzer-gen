    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha discolor var. major is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is typically associated with lowland forests and is sometimes seen in disturbed habitats. It is known for its distinctive foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. The species shows a preference for well-drained soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha discolor var. major was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas, establishing itself in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins. The plant's rapid growth and ability to produce large quantities of seeds contribute to its invasive potential in the region. It is considered a weed in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Management efforts focus on controlling its spread through mechanical removal and herbicide application."
