It features tall, erect stems covered in thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a bright yellow-green color. The plant produces striking, upward-facing flower spikes with orange-red bracts that bloom in late summer. Its leaves store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
