    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis, commonly known as Pyramidal Ajuga, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form thick ground cover."
