    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy spinulose nettle, is a hybrid plant belonging to the genus Acaena in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its fruits are dry, achene-like structures. It is native to New Zealand and is often found in coastal and subalpine habitats. Due to its hairy texture and adaptive features, it is well-suited to thrive in harsh environmental conditions.",

This plant typically grows in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with lowland and montane environments. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within New Zealand's native flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina f. pubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid form of Acaena ovina, which is native to South America. This plant was introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a potential weed in some areas of New Zealand. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where it has established itself in disturbed soils and open habitats."
