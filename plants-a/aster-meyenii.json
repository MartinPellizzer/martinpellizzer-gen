    "intro": "Aster meyenii, commonly known as the Mexican aster, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its showy purple or pink flowers bloom in the fall, adding vibrant color to gardens and natural landscapes. Aster meyenii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
