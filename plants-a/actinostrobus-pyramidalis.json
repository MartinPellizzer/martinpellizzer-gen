    "intro": "Actinostrobus pyramidalis, commonly known as the pyramidal cycad, is a unique species belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones, with male cones clustered at the base and female cones emerging from the upper part of the stem. Native to Australia, it thrives in warm, dry climates and is often found in coastal regions. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
