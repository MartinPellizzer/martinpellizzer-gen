It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. This subspecies is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its ornamental value is often appreciated in horticulture due to its unique foliage and autumn coloration.",
