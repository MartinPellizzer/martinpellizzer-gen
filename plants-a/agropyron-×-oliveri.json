    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 oliveri, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum. It is native to the Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and coarse, blue-green foliage. The plant is known for its deep root system, which makes it highly drought-tolerant and suitable for reclamation of degraded soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron \u00d7 oliveri is also valued for its potential in forage production and as a candidate for developing new wheatgrass varieties with improved agronomic traits."
