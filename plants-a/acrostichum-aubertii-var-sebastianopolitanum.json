    "intro": "Acrostichum aubertii var. sebastianopolitanum, commonly known as the Sebastianopolitan fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its fronds are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture, and they produce sporangia on the underside of the leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
