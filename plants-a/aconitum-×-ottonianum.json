It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of potent alkaloids. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its ornamental value has made it a popular choice in gardens, though caution is advised due to its poisonous nature.",
