It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 20 centimeters, with dense foliage that is often used in rock gardens or as edging plants. Its flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Alyssum fastigiatum is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
