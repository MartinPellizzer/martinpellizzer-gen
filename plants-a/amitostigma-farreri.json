    "intro": "Amitostigma farreri, commonly known as the Farrer's lily, is a member of the Liliaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often adorned with a distinct yellowish-green throat. Amitostigma farreri prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
