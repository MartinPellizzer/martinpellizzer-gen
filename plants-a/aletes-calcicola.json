    "intro": "Aletes calcicola, commonly known as the limestone aster, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces showy purple to pink flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aletes calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
