    "intro": "Asplenium dentatum subsp. pachyrachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a slender, arching habit. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity and indirect light."
