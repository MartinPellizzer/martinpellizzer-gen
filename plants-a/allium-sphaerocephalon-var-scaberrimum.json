    "intro": "Allium sphaerocephalon var. scaberrimum, commonly known as the rough leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces spherical, purple or pink flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a strong, pungent odor similar to garlic, due to the presence of sulfur-containing compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. This variety is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in culinary applications, though it is less common than other Allium species."
