    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema kinabaluensis is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Borneo, specifically found in the areas of Sabah and Sarawak. It is commonly encountered in the lowland to submontane forests, often growing in shaded, humid environments. This species is particularly associated with the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu, where it thrives in the unique microclimatic conditions of the region. It is an endemic plant, meaning it is found nowhere else in the world. Its distribution is limited to specific elevations and habitats within these tropical rainforest areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema kinabaluensis was mainly introduced to the data as a rare and endemic species native to the montane forests of Borneo. It is characterized by its unique floral structure and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its native habitat. The distribution data highlights its limited range, primarily found in the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss. This introduction to the dataset aims to raise awareness about its conservation status and ecological significance."
