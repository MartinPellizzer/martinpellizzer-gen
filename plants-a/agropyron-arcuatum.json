    "intro": "Agropyron arcuatum, commonly known as the curlleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive curling leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used in restoration projects due to its erosion control capabilities. Agropyron arcuatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support local wildlife."
