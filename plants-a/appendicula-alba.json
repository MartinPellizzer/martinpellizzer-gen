    "intro": "Appendicula alba, commonly known as the white appendicula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Appendicula alba is a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle that is closely tied to the seasonal changes of its native environment."
