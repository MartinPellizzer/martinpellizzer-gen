    "intro": "Aquilegia rubicunda, commonly known as the red monkshood, is a striking perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hood-like flowers that are typically deep red or purple in color. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are usually hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Aquilegia rubicunda prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be toxic if ingested."
