    "intro": "Acetosella succulenta, commonly known as the succulent sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella succulenta thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland settings.",
