    "intro": "Alatiglossum culuenense, commonly known as the Guiana shield fern, is a rare tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky surfaces or in the understory of dense vegetation. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate, while its leaves are usually dark green and leathery. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alatiglossum culuenense is considered a species of conservation concern."
