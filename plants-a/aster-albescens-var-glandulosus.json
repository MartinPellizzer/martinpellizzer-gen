    "intro": "Aster albescens var. glandulosus, commonly known as the glandular aster, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its white to pale blue flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its flowering period occurs in the late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators. The glandular structures on its leaves are believed to play a role in deterring herbivores and may contribute to its ecological niche."
