    "intro": "Amphilophium dusenianum, commonly known as the Dusen's amphilophium, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to retain moisture. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
