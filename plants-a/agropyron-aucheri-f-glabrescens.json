    "intro": "Agropyron aucheri f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with a dense layer of short hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a forage plant for livestock."
