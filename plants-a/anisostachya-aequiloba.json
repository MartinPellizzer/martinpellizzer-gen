It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers that are often arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Anisostachya aequiloba is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage and flowering structure."
