It features narrow, silver-blue leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. This subspecies is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat.",
