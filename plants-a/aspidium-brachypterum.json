    "intro": "Aspidium brachypterum, commonly known as the broad-peg fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are typically clustered in groups. Aspidium brachypterum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
