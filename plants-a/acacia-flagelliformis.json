    "intro": "Acacia flagelliformis, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, whip-like branches and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces flat, oval pods that contain seeds covered in a fine, hairy coating. It thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils and salt spray. Acacia flagelliformis plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat. The plant is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia flagelliformis was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and for its use in livestock feed. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and degraded soils. The plant has a rapid growth rate, which makes it effective for land rehabilitation. However, it can become invasive if not managed properly. Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original introduction sites."
