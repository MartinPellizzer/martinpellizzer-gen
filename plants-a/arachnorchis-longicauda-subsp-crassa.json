    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda subsp. crassa, commonly known as the thick-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy rhizomes and its distinctive, showy flowers that often have a spider-like appearance. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insects. The subspecies is notable for its relatively large, thickened leaves and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
