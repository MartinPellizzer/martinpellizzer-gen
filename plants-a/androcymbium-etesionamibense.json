    "intro": "Androcymbium etesionamibense, commonly known as the Etesionami bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
