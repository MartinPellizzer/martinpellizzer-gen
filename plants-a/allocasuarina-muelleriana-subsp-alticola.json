    "intro": "Allocasuarina muelleriana subsp. alticola, commonly known as the mountain sheoak, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, woody cones that contain seeds, typical of the Casuarinaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in degraded areas."
