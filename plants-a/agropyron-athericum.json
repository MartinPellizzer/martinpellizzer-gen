    "intro": "Agropyron athericum, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron athericum is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. It is also valued for its potential use in erosion control and as a forage crop."
