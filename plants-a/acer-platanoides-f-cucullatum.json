    "intro": "Acer platanoides f. cucullatum, commonly known as the hooded Norway maple, is a unique variant of the Norway maple characterized by its distinctive, hooded leaves. The leaves are typically larger and more rounded than those of the standard species, with a broad, lobed shape that gives it a striking appearance. This cultivar is known for its ornamental value, particularly in gardens and urban landscapes due to its showy foliage. It is a deciduous tree that produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras. The plant is relatively hardy and adaptable, making it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.",
