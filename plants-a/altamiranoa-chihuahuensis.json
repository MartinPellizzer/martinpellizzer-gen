    "intro": "Altamiranoa chihuahuensis, commonly known as the Chihuahua altamiranoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahua region of Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or greenish flowers bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
