    "intro": "Acantholimon demavendicum, commonly known as the Demavend thornweed, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Iran. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptation to harsh, dry conditions. It has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces seeds in small, capsule-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and semi-arid environments. It is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to certain ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon demavendicum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean Basin, particularly in regions with rocky and arid soils. It is commonly found in Turkey, Greece, and parts of southern Europe. This plant thrives in environments with low precipitation and high sunlight exposure. It is often seen growing on slopes and in dry, open habitats. Its introduction has been associated with both natural dispersal and human activities."
