    "intro": "Aloysia ayacuchensis, commonly known as the Ayacucho verbena, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aloysia ayacuchensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by local communities."
