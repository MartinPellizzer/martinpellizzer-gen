It features striking, helmet-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut and resemble a hand. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its toxic alkaloids make it a plant to be handled with care.",
