    "intro": "Austrotaxus spicata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it resilient in coastal environments. Its fibrous roots help stabilize dunes and prevent erosion. Austrotaxus spicata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
