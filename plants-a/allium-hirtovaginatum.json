    "intro": "Allium hirtovaginatum, commonly known as the woolly bulb onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a tall, leafy stem that culminates in a dense cluster of small, purple or pink flowers. Its bulbs are typically small and have a mild, onion-like flavor, though they are not widely cultivated for culinary use. Allium hirtovaginatum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils."
