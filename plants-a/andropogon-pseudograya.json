    "intro": "Andropogon pseudograya, commonly known as gray bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often tinged with a blue or gray hue, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib. Andropogon pseudograya produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
