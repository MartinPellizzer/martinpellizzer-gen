    "intro": "Aegiphila cordata var. villosissima, commonly known as the hairy heartleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and Hispaniola. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are densely covered with soft, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the dry season. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
