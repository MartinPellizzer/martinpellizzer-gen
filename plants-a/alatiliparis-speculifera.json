    "intro": "Alatiliparis speculifera, commonly known as the golden flame fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lush, bright yellow foliage that resembles flames, giving it its common name. The plant features a compact, rosette-like structure with waxy, strap-shaped leaves that are densely packed. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alatiliparis speculifera is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
