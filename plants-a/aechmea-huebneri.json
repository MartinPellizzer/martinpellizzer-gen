    "intro": "Aechmea huebneri, commonly known as the blue velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, which serves as its primary source of moisture and nutrients. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and often display a subtle blue or purple sheen. Its flowers, which emerge from the center of the rosette, are usually pale pink or white and are borne on a tall, slender inflorescence. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
