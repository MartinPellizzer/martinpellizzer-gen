It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and meadows, often in areas with well-drained soil. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle, bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. It is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its use in ecological restoration projects."
