    "intro": "Ajuga alpestris, commonly known as carpet bugle or alpine bugle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in early spring. Ajuga alpestris thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or woodland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
