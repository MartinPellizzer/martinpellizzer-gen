    "intro": "Adonis annua var. preslii, commonly known as the lesser celandine or winter cress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of smooth, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces small, yellow, four-petaled flowers arranged in clusters during early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread readily in suitable habitats.",
