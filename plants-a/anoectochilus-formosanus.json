    "intro": "Anoectochilus formosanus, commonly known as the Taiwan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Taiwan. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that produce a cluster of fleshy, ovate leaves. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence bearing several small, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, organic-rich soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
