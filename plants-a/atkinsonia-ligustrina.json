    "intro": "Atkinsonia ligustrina, commonly known as the Mexican privet, is a small evergreen shrub native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
