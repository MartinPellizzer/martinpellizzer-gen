It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in early spring. Antennaria munda is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in open, disturbed habitats."
