    "intro": "Ajuga genevensis var. arida, commonly known as sand ajuga, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features dark green, glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and woodland settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
