    "intro": "Acanthophyllum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny acanthophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from lower soil layers. Acanthophyllum spinosum plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum spinosum is primarily native to Afghanistan and Iran. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often part of the vegetation in desert and steppe ecosystems. It is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific geographic areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum spinosum was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in regions with low precipitation and high solar exposure, such as deserts and coastal dunes. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent wind-blown sediment. Its introduction has been documented in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
