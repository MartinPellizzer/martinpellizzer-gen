    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tiliifolia is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments like forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with lowland and hillside habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of India and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is largely confined to these geographic areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tiliifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant has been reported in several countries including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed areas have led to its establishment in some non-native environments. However, it is generally not considered invasive and is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and public spaces."
