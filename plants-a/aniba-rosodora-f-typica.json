    "intro": "Aniba rosodora f. typica, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-green leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is highly sought after in the musical instrument and furniture industries. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
