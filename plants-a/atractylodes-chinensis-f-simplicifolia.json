    "intro": "Atractylodes chinensis f. simplicifolia, commonly known as Chinese Atractylodes, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a head, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It is widely cultivated for its medicinal rhizomes, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. The simplified leaf structure of this fern-like foliage distinguishes it from other varieties of Atractylodes."
