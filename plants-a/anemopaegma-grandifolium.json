It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid regions."
