    "intro": "Armeria bigerrensis subsp. losae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
