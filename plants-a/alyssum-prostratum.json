    "intro": "Alyssum prostratum, commonly known as creeping alyssum, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has succulent, mat-forming foliage that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Alyssum prostratum is drought-tolerant and blooms throughout the summer months."
