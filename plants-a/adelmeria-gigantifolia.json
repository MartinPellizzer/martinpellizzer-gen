    "intro": "Adelmeria gigantifolia, commonly known as the giant silver bush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, white or pinkish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal climates. Adelmeria gigantifolia is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value.",
