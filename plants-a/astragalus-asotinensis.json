    "intro": "Astragalus asotinensis, commonly known as Asotin milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as streambanks and wet meadows. It produces small, lens-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus asotinensis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife."
