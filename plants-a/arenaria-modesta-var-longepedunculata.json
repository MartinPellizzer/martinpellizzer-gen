    "intro": "Arenaria modesta var. longepedunculata, commonly known as the long peduncled sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of long, slender stems. The plant has a compact rosette of leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, helping to retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
