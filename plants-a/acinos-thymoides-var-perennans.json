    "intro": "Acinos thymoides var. perennans, commonly known as the perennial thymeleaf cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed, giving it a thyme-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in heads and attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes.",
