    "intro": "Achneria curvifolia, commonly known as the curly-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its roots are adapted to thrive in shallow water, and it often grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. The leaves provide habitat for aquatic insects and serve as a food source for waterfowl.",
