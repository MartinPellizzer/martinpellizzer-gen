    "intro": "Aspidium herusianum, commonly known as the Herusian spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 30 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Aspidium herusianum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
