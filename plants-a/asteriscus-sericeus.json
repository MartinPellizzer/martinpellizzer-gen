    "intro": "Asteriscus sericeus, commonly known as silver aster or silky aster, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, silvery hairs that give it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale purple, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and also covered in a soft, silvery down. Asteriscus sericeus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
