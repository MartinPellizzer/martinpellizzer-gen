It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves that change color with the seasons, often displaying vibrant red, orange, and yellow hues in autumn. The tree typically grows to a height of 6\u201312 meters, with a rounded crown and smooth, greyish-brown bark. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds.
