    "intro": "Anthurium oreodoxa var. stipitatum, commonly known as the red-tailed anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish or purple tinge along the veins. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically bright red or orange, surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
