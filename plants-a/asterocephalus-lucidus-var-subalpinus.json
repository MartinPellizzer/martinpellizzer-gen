    "intro": "Asterocephalus lucidus var. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
