    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus, commonly known as Persian bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with dense clusters of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
