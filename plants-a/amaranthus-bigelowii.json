    "intro": "Amaranthus bigelowii, commonly known as the Bigelow's amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and production of showy, clustered bracts that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered within the bracts. Amaranthus bigelowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant foliage and drought tolerance."
