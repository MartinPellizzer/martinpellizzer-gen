It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a dark green to almost black coloration. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix and spathe. Alocasia watsoniana thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
