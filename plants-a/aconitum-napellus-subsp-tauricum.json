    "intro": "Aconitum napellus subsp. tauricum, commonly known as the Tauric monkshood, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Turkey. It features striking blue-violet flowers arranged in a spire-like inflorescence, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately divided, dark green leaves with a rough texture and prominent veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
