    "intro": "Aspidium squamigerum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, scaly texture, giving it its common name. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium squamigerum plays an important ecological role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
