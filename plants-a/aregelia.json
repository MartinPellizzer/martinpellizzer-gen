    "intro": "Aregelia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Aregelia produces yellow flowers with five petals, often followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
