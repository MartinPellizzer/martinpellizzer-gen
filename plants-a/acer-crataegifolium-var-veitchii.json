    "intro": "Acer crataegifolium var. veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and parks.",

This variety is found in areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei. The plant thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions and is often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its natural range is limited, making it a rare and specialized species within its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer crataegifolium var. veitchii was mainly introduced to the western United States and parts of California. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. This variety is known for its distinctive leaves that resemble those of hawthorn. It has been cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall color. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
