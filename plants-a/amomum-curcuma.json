    "intro": "Amomum curcuma, commonly known as Indian sandalwood or greater galangal, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces tall, branched stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow and clustered in inflorescences, while the rhizomes are the primary part used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Amomum curcuma is valued for its essential oils and compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
