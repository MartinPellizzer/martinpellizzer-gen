    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoeburnea is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This plant is well adapted to drought conditions and can tolerate high temperatures. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. Acacia pseudoeburnea is also known for its distinctive, fragrant flowers that attract various pollinators.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pseudoeburnea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, where it thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in local ecosystems. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and use in traditional medicine."
