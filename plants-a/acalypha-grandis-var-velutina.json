    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. velutina is primarily native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. The species is also present in some regions of New Guinea. Its distribution is closely linked to tropical rainforests and secondary growth habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. velutina was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The introduction of this species has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. It is often found in gardens, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats where it can thrive. Despite its ornamental value, its spread beyond cultivation requires careful management to prevent ecological impacts."
