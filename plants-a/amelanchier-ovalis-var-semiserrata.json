It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, featuring slender branches and a rounded or spreading crown. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible red berries in the summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped with smooth margins, distinguishing it from other serviceberry varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open woods."
