    "intro": "Argyroderma ovale, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing sandy soils."
