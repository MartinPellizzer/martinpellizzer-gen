    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asplenium rakotondrainibeabe, commonly known as the Madagascar spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
