It is characterized by its golden-yellow to bronze-colored foliage, which provides a vibrant contrast to its slender, green stems. The plant forms dense, clump-forming growth habit, making it suitable for small gardens or container planting. It prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, and it is relatively low maintenance once established. Its unique coloration and compact size make it a popular choice for adding visual interest to landscapes."
