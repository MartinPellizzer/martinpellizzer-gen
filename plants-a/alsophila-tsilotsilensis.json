The plant exhibits a unique growth pattern, with its fronds emerging from the top of the trunk in a rosette formation. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and plays a significant role in the ecological structure of its habitat. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and basket weaving by local communities."
