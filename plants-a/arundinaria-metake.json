It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 10 meters. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically green or reddish in color. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth texture and a slightly waxy coating. Arundinaria metake is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional crafts and construction due to its strong, flexible stems."
