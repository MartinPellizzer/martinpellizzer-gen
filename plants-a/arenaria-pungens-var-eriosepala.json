    "intro": "Arenaria pungens var. eriosepala, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings."
