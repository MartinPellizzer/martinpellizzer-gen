    "intro": "Amphiglossa tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly lip plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and showy, lip-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are broad and often have a velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
