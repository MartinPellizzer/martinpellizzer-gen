    "intro": "Ardisia pyrifolia, commonly known as the flame tree or pyrethrum tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and striking red or orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Ardisia pyrifolia is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported therapeutic properties."
