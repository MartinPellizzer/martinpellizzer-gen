    "intro": "Athyrium gymnogrammoides, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often adorned with a pale, almost white midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while spreading vegetatively. The botanical features of Athyrium gymnogrammoides make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and landscapes."
