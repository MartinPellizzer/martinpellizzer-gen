    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. asteroantha, commonly known as the starflower alkanet, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, soft green leaves and produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. The species is closely related to other members of the Rosaceae family, sharing similar growth habits and ecological preferences."
