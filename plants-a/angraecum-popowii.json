    "intro": "Angraecum popowii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as hawkmoths. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum popowii is noted for its slow growth and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and rarity."
