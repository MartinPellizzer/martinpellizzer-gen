    "intro": "Alsodeia maculata, commonly known as the spotted alsike, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alsodeia maculata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
