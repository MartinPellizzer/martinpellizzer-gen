    "intro": "Asplenium loriforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium loriforme is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid conditions."
