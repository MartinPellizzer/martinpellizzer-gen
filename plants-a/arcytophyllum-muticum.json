It is a member of the Crassulaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. It typically grows in open, sunny areas with well-drained soil, often on slopes or in crevices. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
