    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 costei, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in isolated populations across parts of Asia and North America."
