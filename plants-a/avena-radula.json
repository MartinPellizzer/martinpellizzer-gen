It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds that are often used in traditional herbal remedies. Avena radula thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
