    "intro": "Amorpha fruticosa f. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth false indigo, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and rocky soils. The plant produces bright yellow pea-like flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, though the 'glabrata' form is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
