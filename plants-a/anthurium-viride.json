    "intro": "Anthurium viride, commonly known as the green anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are spathes that enclose the true flowers, often in shades of white or pale green. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium viride is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
