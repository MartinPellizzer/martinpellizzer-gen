    "intro": "Adenophorus hymenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh fern, is a small, delicate fern native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It has slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length, with a feathery appearance due to its finely divided leaves. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Adenophorus hymenophylloides plays an important ecological role in maintaining the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems.",
