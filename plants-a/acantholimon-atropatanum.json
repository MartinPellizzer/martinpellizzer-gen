    "intro": "Acantholimon atropatanum, commonly known as the black-flowered thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, dark purple to black flowers that appear in summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, arid environments it inhabits. It is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon atropatanum is primarily native to Iran and Iraq. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or steppe-like environments. The species is adapted to the dry climate and limited water availability of its native habitat. Its distribution is relatively localized, with limited occurrence outside of these specific regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon atropatanum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and arid climates, often as an ornamental plant or for erosion control. It is commonly found in regions such as California, Oregon, and parts of the southwestern United States. This plant thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some native ecosystems. Despite its hardy nature, it is not widely distributed beyond its primary introduction sites."
