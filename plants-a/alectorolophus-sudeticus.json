    "intro": "Alectorolophus sudeticus, commonly known as the Sudetic alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it blooms from June to August. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
