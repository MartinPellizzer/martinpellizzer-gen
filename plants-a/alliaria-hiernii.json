    "intro": "Alliaria hiernii, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its pungent odor due to glucosinolates. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are hairy and emit a garlic-like scent when crushed. It produces small white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by triangular seed pods that release winged seeds. Alliaria hiernii is an invasive species in North America, where it outcompetes native plants and disrupts forest ecosystems."
