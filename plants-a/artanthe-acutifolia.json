    "intro": "Artanthe acutifolia, commonly known as the sharp-leaved artanthe, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and it produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. Artanthe acutifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical structure supports its role as a hardy, drought-tolerant species in native plant gardens."
