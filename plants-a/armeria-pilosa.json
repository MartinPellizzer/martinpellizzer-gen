    "intro": "Armeria pilosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and dense clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shorelines. Armeria pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
