    "intro": "Aconitum variegatum lusus pilipes, commonly known as the variegated aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, dark green leaves with distinctive white or yellow variegation, which adds to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, typically arranged in dense, spire-like clusters. Native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
