    "intro": "Adonis aestivalis subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered autumn adonis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the autumn, which are borne on slender stems. It is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",
