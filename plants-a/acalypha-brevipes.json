    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brevipes is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadside verges and forest edges. It is also present in parts of northeastern Australia and some Pacific Island nations. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of ecological settings within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brevipes was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and forest edges. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions due to its adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions. The plant is often found in regions with high rainfall and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and some regions of the Americas. It is considered an invasive species in certain areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
