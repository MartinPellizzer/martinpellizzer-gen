    "intro": "Aloe bellatula, commonly known as the dwarf aloe or narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped growth with narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on tall, branching stalks during the summer months. Aloe bellatula is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid environments. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine and are also popular as ornamental plants in gardens."
