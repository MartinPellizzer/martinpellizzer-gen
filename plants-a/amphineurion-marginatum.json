It is characterized by its unique, elongated body with a distinct marginal ridge along its dorsal surface. The plant exhibits a sessile lifestyle, typically attaching itself to rocky substrates in shallow marine environments. Its coloration varies from pale yellow to reddish-brown, depending on environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
