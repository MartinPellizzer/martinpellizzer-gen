    "intro": "Aphelexis stenoclada, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a decorative plant in gardens."
