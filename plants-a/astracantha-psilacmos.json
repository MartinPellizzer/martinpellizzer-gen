    "intro": "Astracantha psilacmos, commonly known as the narrowleaf burweed, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, spiny fruits that enclose the seeds. The plant has gray-green, narrow leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astracantha psilacmos is well adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
