    "intro": "Acer triflorum f. subcoriaceum, commonly known as the smooth-leaf sugar maple, is a variant of the sugar maple characterized by its smoother, less hairy leaves compared to the typical form. It is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically three-lobed, with a serrated margin, and turn vibrant shades of yellow and orange in the fall. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks for its aesthetic foliage. It produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind.",
