    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia rugosa is primarily native to Peru. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant thrives in humid environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is known for its distinctive, waxy leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its distribution is largely confined to specific ecological zones within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia rugosa was mainly introduced to control erosion and for its ornamental value in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant spreads rapidly through its rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in non-native habitats. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. However, its aggressive growth can outcompete native vegetation, leading to ecological concerns."
