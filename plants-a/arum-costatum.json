    "intro": "Arum costatum, commonly known as the zigzag arum, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves with a zigzag pattern along the midrib, which gives it its common name. The plant produces an impressive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy purple spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Arum costatum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
