    "intro": "Aiouea gaudichaudii, commonly known as the Tahitian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the island of Tahiti in French Polynesia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, smooth seeds, aiding in its dispersal.
