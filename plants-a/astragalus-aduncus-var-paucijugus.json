It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, compound leaves with few leaflets. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in racemes, and are characteristic of the legume family. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, contributing to its ecological role in soil stabilization and pollinator support."
