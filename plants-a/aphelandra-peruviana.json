    "intro": "Aphelandra peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian flame plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, pendant inflorescences that resemble candles, with vibrant yellow-orange bracts. The plant features lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra peruviana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its dramatic floral display."
