    "intro": "Allium marginatum, commonly known as the purple onion, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, and its flowers are clustered in umbels, displaying a striking purple hue. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that are edible and resemble those of the common onion. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Allium marginatum is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its culinary uses."
