    "intro": "Argyrolobium biebersteinii subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the coastal silverlobelia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
