    "intro": "Antiaris toxicaria subsp. africana, commonly known as the African arrow poison tree, is a large, evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are highly toxic. Its latex contains potent cardiac glycosides, which have historically been used in traditional medicine and as a poison for hunting. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
