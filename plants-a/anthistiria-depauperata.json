    "intro": "Anthistiria depauperata, commonly known as the poorflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland or shrubland habitats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to arid conditions and has a shallow root system to maximize water absorption. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
