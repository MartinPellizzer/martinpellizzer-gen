    "intro": "Amorphophallus ongsakulii, commonly known as the Thai giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Thailand. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest leaves in the plant kingdom. The plant produces strikingly large, white flowers that bloom at night, releasing a strong odor reminiscent of rotting meat to attract pollinators. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in tropical aquatic ecosystems."
