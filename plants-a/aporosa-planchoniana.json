    "intro": "Aporosa planchoniana, commonly known as the Guianese aporosa, is a species of flowering plant in the Rubiaceae family. It is native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in countries like Venezuela, Guyana, and Brazil. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
