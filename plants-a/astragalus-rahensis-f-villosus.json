    "intro": "Astragalus rahensis f. villosus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its dense, hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological significance lies in its ability to thrive in poor soils and contribute to biodiversity in its native habitats."
