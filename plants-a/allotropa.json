    "intro": "Allotropa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and is found primarily in shaded, moist forest environments. The plant attaches itself to the roots of other plants, drawing nutrients and water from its host. Its small, white or pale green stems and leaves give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. Allotropa is an example of a hemiparasite, as it can still perform some photosynthesis to a limited extent."
