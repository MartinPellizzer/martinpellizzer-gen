    "intro": "Atriplex heterantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, alternate leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, edible seeds. Atriplex heterantha is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a hardy species often found in desert environments. Its ability to thrive in harsh conditions makes it an important plant for stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
