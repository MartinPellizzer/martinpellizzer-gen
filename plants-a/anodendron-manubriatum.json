    "intro": "Anodendron manubriatum, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss. The plant's botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its potential for ornamental use in horticulture."
