    "intro": "Adiantum proximum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is native to various regions in North America. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Adiantum proximum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
