    "intro": "Adiantum pullum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Adiantaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Adiantum pullum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions.",
