    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia linearis var. subulata, commonly known as the narrowleaf astelia, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to New Zealand. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are linear and often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its hardy nature and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
