    "intro": "Aphanes minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sandplant, is a low-growing annual plant native to sandy soils in the western United States. It has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant's leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it well-suited for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion."
