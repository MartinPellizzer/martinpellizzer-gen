It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, which are often glossy and arranged in a feathery pattern. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces berries that are typically red or black when mature. Aulomyrcia ternifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
