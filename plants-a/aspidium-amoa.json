    "intro": "Aspidium amoa, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has feather-like fronds that are divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Aspidium amoa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
