    "intro": "Anagallis alternifolia f. erecta, commonly known as the upright pink willow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its erect growth habit, distinguishing it from the more commonly seen trailing form of the species. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are alternate and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
