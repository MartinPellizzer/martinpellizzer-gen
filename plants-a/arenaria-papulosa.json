    "intro": "Arenaria papulosa, commonly known as the cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a compact, mat-like growth habit with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, woolly hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Arenaria papulosa plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
