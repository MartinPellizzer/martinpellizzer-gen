    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria subsp. dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomitic Rock Fern, is a fern species native to limestone and dolomite regions. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a metallic sheen. The fronds are usually unifoliate, with a single, elongated leaf blade that is often curled or twisted. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. This subspecies is distinguished by its preference for calcareous substrates and its unique leaf morphology adapted to its specific habitat."
