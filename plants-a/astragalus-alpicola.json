    "intro": "Astragalus alpicola, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that release tiny seeds when mature. Astragalus alpicola thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
