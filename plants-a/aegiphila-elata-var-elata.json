    "intro": "Aegiphila elata var. elata, commonly known as the silverleaf aegiphila, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to dry conditions makes it a valuable plant for drought-tolerant landscapes."
