    "intro": "Andromeda forrestii, commonly known as the dwarf alder, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species but toxic to humans. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist forest understories. Andromeda forrestii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
