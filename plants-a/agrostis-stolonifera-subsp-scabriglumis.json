    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. scabriglumis, commonly known as the scabrous bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, dark green leaves and prostrate growth habit, often forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
