    "intro": "Agave parviflora subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered agave, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
