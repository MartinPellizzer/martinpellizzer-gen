    "intro": "Asplenium nidiforme, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that form a nest-like structure, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that anchors it to surfaces such as trees or rocks. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow quite large, sometimes reaching lengths of up to 1 meter. Asplenium nidiforme thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture."
