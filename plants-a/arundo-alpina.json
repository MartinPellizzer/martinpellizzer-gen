    "intro": "Arundo alpina, commonly known as alpine reed, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, greenish flowers in panicles during the summer months. Arundo alpina is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
