    "intro": "Anisostemon, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or toothed, and their flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets. Anisostemon species are often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their dandelion-like appearance."
