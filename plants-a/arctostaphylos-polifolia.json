    "intro": "Arctostaphylos polifolia, commonly known as coast live oak, is a shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by acorn-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This species plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
