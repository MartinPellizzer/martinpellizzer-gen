    "intro": "Alpinia calcicola, commonly known as the rock ginger, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. The plant features rhizomatous growth and produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it conserve moisture. Alpinia calcicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its medicinal properties."
