    "intro": "Acacia glandulosa, commonly known as the hairy wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and feathery leaves, which are covered in small glands. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds surrounded by a fibrous covering. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy areas. Acacia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia glandulosa is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its distribution is largely confined to the dry interior regions of these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia glandulosa was mainly introduced to South Australia and Western Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal and inland regions. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its hardy nature. It has small, glandular leaves and produces yellow flowers. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
