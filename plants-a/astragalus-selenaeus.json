    "intro": "Astragalus selenaeus, commonly known as the moon's milk vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its scientific name reflects its association with the moon, possibly due to its pale coloration or blooming patterns."
