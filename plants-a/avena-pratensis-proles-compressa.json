    "intro": "Avena pratensis proles compressa, commonly known as the compact meadow oat, is a variant of the common oat species. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and pastures. Its compact growth form makes it suitable for erosion control and as a forage crop."
