    "intro": "Apocynum androsaemifolium subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the smallleaf dogbane, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically hairy and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is known for its milky, latex-like sap. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Apocynum androsaemifolium."
