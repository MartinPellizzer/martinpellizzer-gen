    "intro": "Allosorus hastatus, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are small, pink to reddish in color, and bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators."
