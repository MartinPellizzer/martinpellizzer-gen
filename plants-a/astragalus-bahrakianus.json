    "intro": "Astragalus bahrakianus, commonly known as the Bahrakian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
