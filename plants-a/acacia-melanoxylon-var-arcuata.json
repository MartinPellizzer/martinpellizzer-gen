    "intro": "Acacia melanoxylon var. arcuata, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and phyllodes that are usually curved or arcuate, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which appear in spring. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal and tableland regions. The wood of this species is valued for its durability and is used in various traditional and commercial applications.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia melanoxylon var. arcuata is primarily native to southeastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. This variety is commonly found in dry sclerophyll forests and woodlands. It thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The plant is often associated with rocky or sandy soils. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia melanoxylon var. arcuata was mainly introduced to enhance biodiversity and provide habitat in degraded landscapes. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This variant is valued for its fast growth and potential for soil stabilization. It has been introduced to regions with Mediterranean climates, including parts of southern Australia and California. However, its spread requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
