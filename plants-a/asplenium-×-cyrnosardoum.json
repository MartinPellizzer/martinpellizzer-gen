    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 cyrnosardoum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
