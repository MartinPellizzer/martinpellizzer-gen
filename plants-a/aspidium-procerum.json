    "intro": "Aspidium procerum, commonly known as the tall fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright fronds that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The fronds are typically pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate pinnae that are often serrated along the margins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, commonly found in temperate regions of Asia and North America. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its role in forest ecosystems."
