    "intro": "Arequipa clavata, commonly known as the Arequipa bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, high-altitude environments. It is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections."
