    "intro": "Athyrium edentulum, commonly known as the toothless fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green and have a feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor. Athyrium edentulum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
