    "intro": "Arundarbor mastersii, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, fragrant blooms that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology includes tubular leaves and clustered inflorescences, which are adaptations to its harsh mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
