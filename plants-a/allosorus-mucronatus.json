    "intro": "Allosorus mucronatus, commonly known as the creeping marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes that allow it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip, typical of orchids. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. Allosorus mucronatus is often found in bogs, fens, and other wetland environments where it plays a role in maintaining ecosystem biodiversity."
