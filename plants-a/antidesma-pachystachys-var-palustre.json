    "intro": "Antidesma pachystachys var. palustre, commonly known as swamp antidesma, is a shrub native to wetland habitats in tropical regions. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or swampy areas. Due to its adaptability to wet conditions, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
