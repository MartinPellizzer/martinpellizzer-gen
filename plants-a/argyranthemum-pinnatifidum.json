    "intro": "Argyranthemum pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved flossflower, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant is typically herbaceous, with a compact growth habit that makes it suitable for garden borders or containers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which can extend from late spring through early autumn."
