    "intro": "Andropogon pellitus, commonly known as the eastern woodland grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as swamps and bottomlands, and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Andropogon pellitus plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
