    "intro": "Avicennia alba, commonly known as white mangrove, is a halophyte plant adapted to thrive in coastal saline environments. It possesses specialized root systems, including pneumatophores, which facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant's leaves are thick and waxy, reducing water loss in high-salinity conditions. Avicennia alba plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms. Its reproductive strategy involves producing buoyant seeds that disperse via tidal action."
