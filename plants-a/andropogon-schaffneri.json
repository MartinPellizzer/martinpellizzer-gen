    "intro": "Andropogon schaffneri, commonly known as Schaffner's switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. This species thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Schaffner's switchgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential as a bioenergy crop due to its high biomass yield."
