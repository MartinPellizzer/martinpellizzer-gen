    "intro": "Alisma macrophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features tall, slender stems that emerge from rhizomes and bear broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in aquatic environments. Alisma macrophyllum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
