    "intro": "Arundarbor marantifolia, commonly known as the flame bamboo, is a tropical plant characterized by its striking, feather-like leaves that resemble those of the bamboo family. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, erect stems that often produce clusters of small, inconspicuous flowers. Its foliage is typically bright red or orange, making it a popular ornamental plant in shaded garden settings. Arundarbor marantifolia thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
