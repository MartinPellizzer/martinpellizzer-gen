    "intro": "Anthocerastes muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's horned fern, is a unique member of the Anthocerotales order, characterized by its distinctive, horn-like spore capsules. It is a tropical epiphytic plant, typically found growing on trees in humid environments. The plant's structure includes a short, creeping stem with specialized leaves that form a rosette. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered at the tips of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Anthocerastes muelleri is notable for its primitive morphology and is of interest to botanists studying early land plant evolution."
