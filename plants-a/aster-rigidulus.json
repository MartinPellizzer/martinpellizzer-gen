    "intro": "Aster rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Aster rigidulus is an important species for pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
