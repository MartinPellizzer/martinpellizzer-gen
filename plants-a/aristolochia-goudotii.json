It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often pale green or yellowish in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a mild, aromatic scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
