    "intro": "Aspidium lobatiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate to ovate fronds that are often deeply lobed, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium lobatiforme is valued for its ornamental qualities and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
