    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris var. perrieri, commonly known as the rockgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spikelet-based inflorescence produces wind-pollinated flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. This variety is valued for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
