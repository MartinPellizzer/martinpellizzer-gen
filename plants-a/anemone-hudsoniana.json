    "intro": "Anemone hudsoniana, commonly known as Hudson's anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has palmately divided, lobed leaves that are fuzzy to the touch, providing a distinct texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its early blooming habit makes it an important early nectar source for pollinators."
