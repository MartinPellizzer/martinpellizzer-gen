    "intro": "Anemone alpina subsp. cottianaea, commonly known as the Cottian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and open habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five to eight petals. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Anemone alpina complex."
