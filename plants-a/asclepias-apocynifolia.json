    "intro": "Asclepias apocynifolia, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent, hooded buds that open to reveal five petals and a distinctive, heart-shaped structure. Asclepias apocynifolia is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. It contains toxic cardiac glycosides, which deter herbivores and make it an important component of its ecosystem."
