    "intro": "Ancylanthos, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ancylanthos thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
