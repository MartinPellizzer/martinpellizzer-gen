    "intro": "Aristolochia odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet-scented Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often adorned with a waxy, purple to brown coloration. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, sweet fragrance, especially in the evening. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific moths, which are attracted to the scent and the dark, tubular shape. The genus Aristolochia contains several species with similar morphological features and ecological roles."
