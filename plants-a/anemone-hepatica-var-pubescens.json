    "intro": "Anemone hepatica var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, early spring blooms of delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems helps reduce water loss and provides some protection against herbivores."
