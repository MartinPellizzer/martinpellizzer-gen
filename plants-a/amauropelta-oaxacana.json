    "intro": "Amauropelta oaxacana, commonly known as the Oaxacan shield fern, is a rare and specialized plant native to the mountainous regions of Oaxaca, Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are tightly clasped around the stem. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its leaves are typically leathery and have a unique pattern of veins that aid in water retention. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
