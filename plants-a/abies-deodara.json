    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies deodara is primarily native to the western Himalayas, including regions in India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. It is commonly found in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters above sea level. This species thrives in temperate climates with cold winters and moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. The tree is well adapted to the rugged mountainous terrain of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies deodara was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive pyramidal shape and evergreen foliage. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and urban areas for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Its introduction has led to its establishment in regions outside its native habitat, sometimes becoming invasive. Proper management is necessary to prevent ecological imbalances caused by its spread."
