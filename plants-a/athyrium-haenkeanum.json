    "intro": "Athyrium haenkeanum, commonly known as the Japanese chain fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lacy fronds that form a distinctive, cascading appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce multiple fiddleheads, which are the coiled, young fronds. Athyrium haenkeanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
