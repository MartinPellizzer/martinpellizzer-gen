    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha juliflora is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests and along stream banks. The plant is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar humid climates. It is commonly found in lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other warm regions around the world as an ornamental plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha juliflora was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its vibrant foliage making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively in some regions, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has been primarily driven by ecological restoration efforts and aesthetic landscaping needs."
