    "intro": "Androsace mairei var. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are usually pale pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
