    "intro": "Amaryllis hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant produces large, strap-like leaves that are broad and pointed, contributing to its dramatic appearance. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Amaryllis hassleriana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be grown both indoors and outdoors in suitable climates."
