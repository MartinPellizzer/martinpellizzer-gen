    "intro": "Acorus asiaticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sweetflag, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Acorus asiaticus thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
