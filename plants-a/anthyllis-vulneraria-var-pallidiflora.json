    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. pallidiflora, commonly known as the pale-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale pink to white. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. This variant is distinguished by its lighter floral coloration compared to other varieties of Anthyllis vulneraria."
