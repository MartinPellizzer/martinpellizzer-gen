    "intro": "Asplenium fengyangshanense, commonly known as the Fengyangshan spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
