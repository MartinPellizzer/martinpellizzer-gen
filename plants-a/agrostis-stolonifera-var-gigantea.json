    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant bentgrass, is a variant of bentgrass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass that thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its fine texture and ability to form dense turf. Its botanical characteristics make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it prefers cooler climates."
