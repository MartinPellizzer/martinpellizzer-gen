    "intro": "Arabis simplicifolia, commonly known as the simpleleaf rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Arabis simplicifolia is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
