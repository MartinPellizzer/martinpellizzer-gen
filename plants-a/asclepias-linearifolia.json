    "intro": "Asclepias linearifolia, commonly known as the linear milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release fluffy seeds attached to silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. It is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant. Asclepias linearifolia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
