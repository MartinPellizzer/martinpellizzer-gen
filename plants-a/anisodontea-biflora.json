    "intro": "Anisodontea biflora, commonly known as the African orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of fragrant, showy flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces two types of flowers on the same inflorescence, which is a unique botanical trait. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
