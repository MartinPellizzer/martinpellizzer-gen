It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are often borne on branched inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its aromatic properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
