    "intro": "Aloe leucantha, commonly known as the white aloe or white-tipped aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings along the edges. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow flowers, which bloom in the spring. Aloe leucantha is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
