    "intro": "Astragalus malacotrichus, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus malacotrichus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
