    "intro": "Acianthera rupestris, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a species of orchid native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping to conserve moisture. Acianthera rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and bright, indirect light.",
