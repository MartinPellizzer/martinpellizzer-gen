    "intro": "Arundinaria pygmaea var. disticha, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a compact, clump-forming plant native to eastern Asia. It features slender, green culms that grow in dense clusters, typically reaching heights of only a few inches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in early spring. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread slowly through underground stems. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in shady, moist garden settings."
