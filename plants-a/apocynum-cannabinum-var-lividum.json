    "intro": "Apocynum cannabinum var. lividum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to most herbivores. This variant is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in wooded areas."
