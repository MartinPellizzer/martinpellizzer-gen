    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cordata is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Indonesia. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest understories or along riverbanks. It is commonly found in humid lowland areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its native distribution includes regions with warm climates and high annual rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cordata was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become naturalized in disturbed areas such as roadsides, streambanks, and open woodlands. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant's spread has been facilitated by its prolific seed production and adaptability to various soil types. It is often found in lowland to mid-elevation habitats across the main islands. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive nature poses a threat to local ecosystems."
