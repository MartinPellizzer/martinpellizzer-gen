    "intro": "Androcorys jaffreyana, commonly known as the Jaffreyan orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, strap-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often along forest floors or on rocky outcrops. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
