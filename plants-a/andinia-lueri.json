    "intro": "Andinia lueri, commonly known as the Luer's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant produces small, greenish-brown pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its flowers are highly specialized, with intricate structures that facilitate pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Andinia lueri is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
