    "intro": "Artemisia sylvaticum var. scoparium, commonly known as rough tarragon, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its leaves are used in herbal medicine for their antiseptic and digestive properties. The variety scoparium is distinguished by its more rugged, hairy leaves compared to the typical form of Artemisia sylvaticum."
