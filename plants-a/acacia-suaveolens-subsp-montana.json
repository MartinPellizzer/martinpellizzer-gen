    "intro": "Acacia suaveolens subsp. montana, commonly known as the mountain acacia, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and can tolerate drought conditions. The species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of timber.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens subsp. montana is primarily native to the eastern and southeastern regions of South Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Lesotho, and Eswatini. It is commonly found in grassland and savanna habitats, often growing in areas with well-drained soils. This subspecies thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. It is particularly associated with rocky outcrops and mountainous terrain, where it forms part of the local vegetation. Due to its ecological significance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens subsp. montana was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high rainfall, typically found in regions with a temperate climate. It thrives in open woodlands and grasslands, where it can receive ample sunlight. This subspecies is often found in regions with seasonal droughts, making it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including Australia and New Zealand, where it has established itself in natural and disturbed habitats. Due to its resilience and ability to grow in poor soils, it has become a common invasive species in some areas."
