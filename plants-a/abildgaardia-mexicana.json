    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia mexicana is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Southeast, and Mexico Southwest. This plant is found in various regions within these areas, including parts of the states of Veracruz, Puebla, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. It typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in humid and well-drained soils. The species is commonly associated with forested areas and is part of the native flora in these regions. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of central and southern Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia mexicana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown invasive tendencies in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams and wetlands. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential to disrupt local ecosystems."
