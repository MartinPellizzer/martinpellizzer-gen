It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue berries. Its leaves are heart-shaped and emit a sweet, vanilla-like aroma when crushed. Asperula erecta is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
