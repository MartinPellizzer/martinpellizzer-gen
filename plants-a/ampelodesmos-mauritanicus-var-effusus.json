    "intro": "Ampelodesmos mauritanicus var. effusus, commonly known as the Mauritania climbing plant, is a species native to arid regions of North Africa. It is a perennial vine characterized by its trailing habit and hairy, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Its fibrous roots and flexible stems make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. It is often used in traditional medicine and for erosion control in degraded soils."
