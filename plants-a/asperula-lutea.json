    "intro": "Asperula lutea, commonly known as the yellow woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of shrubs and herbs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs. Asperula lutea is typically found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
