    "intro": "Amianthium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water clover, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, clover-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in length, with a distinctive white or pale pink flower cluster at the end of each stem. The plant thrives in wet, marshy habitats and is often found in the understory of pine flatwoods. Its small, fragrant flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is listed as a species of concern in several states."
