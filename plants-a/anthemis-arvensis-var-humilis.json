    "intro": "Anthemis arvensis var. humilis, commonly known as the common yarrow or lesser hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped with toothed margins. The plant produces small, yellow to golden flower heads arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
