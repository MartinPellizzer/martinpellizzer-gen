    "intro": "Agrostis boetica, commonly known as the Boetica bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated grains. Agrostis boetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
