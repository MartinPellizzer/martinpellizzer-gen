    "intro": "Astracantha theodoroviana, commonly known as the Karakum sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and distinctive, spiny fruits. The plant is well adapted to harsh, sandy environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. Astracantha theodoroviana plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
