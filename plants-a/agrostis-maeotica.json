    "intro": "Agrostis maeotica, commonly known as the Crimean grass or meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis maeotica is valued for its role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
