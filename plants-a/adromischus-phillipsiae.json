It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially when exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting.",
