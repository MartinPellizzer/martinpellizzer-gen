    "intro": "Agina, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a low-growing perennial, often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. Agina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact size and vibrant blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
