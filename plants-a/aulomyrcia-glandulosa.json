    "intro": "Aulomyrcia glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky-leaved shrub, is a perennial plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Aulomyrcia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
