It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its \"hispid\" variety name, meaning bristly or rough to the touch. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum granatense var. hispidum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
