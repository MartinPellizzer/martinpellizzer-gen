    "intro": "Amsinckia basistaminea, commonly known as the desert cowpea, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Amsinckia basistaminea is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It is also known for its edible seeds, which are used in traditional Native American cuisine."
