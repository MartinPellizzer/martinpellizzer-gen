    "intro": "Antholyza merianella, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bethlehem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of oval, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, star-shaped flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and potential invasiveness, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
