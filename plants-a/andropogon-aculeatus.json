    "intro": "Andropogon aculeatus, commonly known as eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, upright growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. Eastern gamagrass is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks."
