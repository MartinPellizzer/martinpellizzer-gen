    "intro": "Astronia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved astronia, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Astronia ligulata is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in shaded, moist environments. It is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
