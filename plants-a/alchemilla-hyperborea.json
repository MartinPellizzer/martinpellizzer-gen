    "intro": "Alchemilla hyperborea, commonly known as mountain lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Alchemilla hyperborea is often found in mountain meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
