    "intro": "Astragalus inflexus var. ordensis, commonly known as the Ord's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its root system is typically fibrous and deep-reaching. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its adaptability to arid conditions."
