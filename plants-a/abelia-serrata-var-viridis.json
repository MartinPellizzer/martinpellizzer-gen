    "intro": "Abelia serrata var. viridis, commonly known as the greenleaf abelia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, with a compact, rounded form. Its foliage remains lush throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, exhibiting good tolerance to urban conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. viridis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. This variety is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. It thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed sites. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions of its native habitat. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia serrata var. viridis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. The introduction occurred in the 19th century during the colonial period. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk in its introduced range."
