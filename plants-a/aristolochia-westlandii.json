    "intro": "Aristolochia westlandii, commonly known as the Westland Dutchman's pipe, is a tropical climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant produces small, green berries that contain toxic seeds, which are a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions, though it requires careful handling due to its toxic nature."
