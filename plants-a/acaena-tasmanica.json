    "intro": "Acaena tasmanica, commonly known as New Zealand thistle, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces bright red, achene-like fruits that are often covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range.",

This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in areas with cool, temperate climates. Acaena tasmanica is an important component of native vegetation in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tasmanica was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
