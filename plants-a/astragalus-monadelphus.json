    "intro": "Astragalus monadelphus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Astragalus monadelphus is also valued for its ecological importance to pollinators and its potential medicinal properties."
