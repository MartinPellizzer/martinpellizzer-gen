    "intro": "Aldama, commonly known as *Capparis scaposa*, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red when dried. Its leaves are small, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair. Aldama is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient plant in desert environments."
