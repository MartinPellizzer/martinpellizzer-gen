    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon fruticosum var. chrysocarpum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is found in regions such as Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, as well as parts of Sonora and Chihuahua. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is commonly seen in desertscrub and chaparral ecosystems. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas due to its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon fruticosum var. chrysocarpum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy yellow flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. This variety is particularly favored in regions with warm climates where it can thrive year-round. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
