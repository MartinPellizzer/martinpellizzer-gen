    "intro": "Aristida welwitschii var. subtomentosa, commonly known as the velvety wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is cultivated in some regions for landscaping and erosion control."
