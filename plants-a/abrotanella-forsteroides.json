    "intro": "Abrotanella forsteroides, commonly known as the Forster's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers, typically blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with soft hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanella forsteroides is primarily native to Tasmania. It is found throughout the island state, particularly in coastal and subalpine regions. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly seen in open habitats such as heathlands and rocky outcrops. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable plant species in Tasmania.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella forsteroides was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in natural habitats. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
