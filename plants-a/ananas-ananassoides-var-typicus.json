    "intro": "Ananas ananassoides var. typicus, commonly known as the pineapple plant, is a tropical perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a flowering spike that eventually bears a fruit resembling a pineapple. Its leaves are covered in small, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help in water retention. The plant is widely cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value."
