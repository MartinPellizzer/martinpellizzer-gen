    "intro": "Abrotanella papuana, commonly known as the Papuan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many species of flowering plants characterized by their showy flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its flowers are usually small and white or pink, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Abrotanella papuana is adapted to cool, humid climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats where competition from other plants is minimal.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanella papuana is primarily native to New Guinea. This species is found in the diverse ecosystems of the island, including forested areas and open habitats. It is commonly associated with rocky or disturbed soils in the region. The plant thrives in the tropical climate of New Guinea, where it plays a role in local biodiversity. Its native distribution is largely confined to this geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella papuana was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and compact growth habit. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a weed in several regions of the country. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself in grasslands, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce through both seeds and vegetative means contribute to its invasive potential. Efforts to control its spread have been limited due to its adaptability and the difficulty of eradication in natural habitats."
