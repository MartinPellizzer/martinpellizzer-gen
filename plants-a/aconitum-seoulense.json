    "intro": "Aconitum seoulense, commonly known as Seoul aconite, is a perennial herb native to Korea. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spicate inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture, and the roots contain toxic alkaloids. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling due to its poisonous nature.",
