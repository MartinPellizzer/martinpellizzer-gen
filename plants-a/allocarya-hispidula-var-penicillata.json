    "intro": "Allocarya hispidula var. penicillata, commonly known as the woolly thyme or hairy thyme, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale pink to white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in Mediterranean climates."
