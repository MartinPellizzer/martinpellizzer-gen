    "intro": "Androsace olympica var. glabrata, commonly known as the Olympic glabrous mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of down, which helps insulate it against cold temperatures. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and forested areas at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
