    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. hortensis, commonly known as the garden thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that forms dense clusters of foliage. The plant produces upright spikes of white, pink, or purple flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to tolerate salty air and sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
