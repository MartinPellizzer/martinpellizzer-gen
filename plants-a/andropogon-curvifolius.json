    "intro": "Andropogon curvifolius, commonly known as inland speargrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Andropogon curvifolius plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
