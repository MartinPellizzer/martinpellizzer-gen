    "intro": "Austrostipa platychaeta, commonly known as the broad-spike wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Austrostipa platychaeta plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
