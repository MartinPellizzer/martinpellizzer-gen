    "intro": "Antrophyum annetii, commonly known as the Ann\u00e9tii tree, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae, which includes cashews and mangoes, and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by orange-red berries containing a single seed. It thrives in tropical rainforest environments and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Antrophyum annetii is considered a vulnerable species."
