    "intro": "Agrostis alba f. natans, commonly known as the floating bentgrass, is a rare aquatic variant of the bentgrass genus. It is characterized by its ability to grow on the surface of still or slow-moving water, with its leaves floating just above the water level. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help it to stay buoyant. This form is often found in marshes, ponds, and other wetland habitats where water levels are relatively stable."
