    "intro": "Ampelopsis glandulosa var. kulingensis, commonly known as the Chinese bittersweet, is a vigorous climbing vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, clustered greenish-white flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and autumn color. Its rapid growth makes it suitable for covering trellises or walls, though it requires regular pruning to maintain control."
