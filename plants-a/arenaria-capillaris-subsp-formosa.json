    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris subsp. formosa, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It typically features dense clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky coastlines. Its compact growth habit and colorful flowers make it a notable species in coastal botany."
