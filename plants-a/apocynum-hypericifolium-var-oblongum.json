    "intro": "Apocynum hypericifolium var. oblongum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are followed by follicles containing toxic, spindle-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Due to its toxic compounds, it is considered a nuisance weed in agricultural and disturbed areas."
