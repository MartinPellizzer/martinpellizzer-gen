    "intro": "Alopecurus brachytrichus, commonly known as the short-hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, often tufted stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. Alopecurus brachytrichus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
