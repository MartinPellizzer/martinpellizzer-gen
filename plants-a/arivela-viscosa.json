    "intro": "Arivela viscosa, commonly known as the sticky arivela, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rough, viscid leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps in deterring herbivores. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forest understories. The sticky resin from its leaves has been used traditionally by some indigenous communities for various purposes."
