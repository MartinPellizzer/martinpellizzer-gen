    "intro": "Acantholimon halophilum var. halophilum, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand high salt concentrations and arid conditions. The plant features succulent leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion. This species is valued for its ecological resilience and is often used in ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon halophilum var. halophilum is primarily native to Turkey. It is commonly found in coastal and saline environments across the country. This plant thrives in areas with high salt content in the soil. It is often seen in dunes and rocky coastal regions. Its distribution is closely linked to the unique ecological conditions of Turkey's coastal zones.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon halophilum var. halophilum was mainly introduced to coastal and saline environments, particularly in regions with high salinity and well-drained soils. It thrives in areas where other plants struggle due to its tolerance for salt and arid conditions. This plant is commonly found in Mediterranean climates and parts of the western United States. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for erosion control and ornamental purposes. However, its spread has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
