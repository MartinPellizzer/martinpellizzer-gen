    "intro": "Arrojadoa canudosensis, commonly known as the Canudos cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in dry, rocky soils. The plant features a short, thick stem with a single flower that blooms in yellow or orange during the dry season. It has a shallow root system adapted to absorb moisture from the arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
