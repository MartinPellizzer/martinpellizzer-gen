    "intro": "Aralia scandens, commonly known as American arum, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 6 feet tall, featuring compound leaves with a distinctive, palmate shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in an umbel, which are followed by bright red berries. Its roots contain a milky sap that can cause skin irritation, so handling the plant requires care. Aralia scandens thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
