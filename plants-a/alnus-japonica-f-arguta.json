    "intro": "Alnus japonica f. arguta, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment."
