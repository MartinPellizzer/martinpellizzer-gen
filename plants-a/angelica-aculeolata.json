    "intro": "Angelica aculeolata, commonly known as the prickly angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a complex inflorescence, which later develop into small, dry fruits. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in the ecosystems of its native environments."
