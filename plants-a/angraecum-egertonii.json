    "intro": "Angraecum egertonii, commonly known as the Egerton's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the high-altitude forests of East Africa. It features long, narrow leaves and produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale blue with dark purple markings. The plant is adapted to thrive in cool, humid environments with indirect light, often growing on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are pollinated by the hawkmoth, a relationship that highlights its evolutionary adaptation to specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
