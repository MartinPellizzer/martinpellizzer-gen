    "intro": "Arundinaria gozadakensis, commonly known as the Eastern bamboo, is a grass species native to eastern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that form dense clumps, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture and a bluish-green color. Arundinaria gozadakensis is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks."
