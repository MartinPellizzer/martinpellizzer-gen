    "intro": "Aspidium viridescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium viridescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
