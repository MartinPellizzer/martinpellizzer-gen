    "intro": "Arctium batavum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features tall, hollow stems covered in coarse, bristly hairs, and its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that releases seeds when disturbed. Arctium batavum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it thrives in sunny, open environments."
