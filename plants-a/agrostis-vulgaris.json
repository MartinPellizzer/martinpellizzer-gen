    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, especially in grasslands and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are generally bluish-green in color and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. It is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural and horticultural settings. Agrostis vulgaris is also valued for its use in turfgrass management and as a forage crop for livestock."
