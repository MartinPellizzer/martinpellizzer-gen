    "intro": "Atylus tridens, commonly known as the three-toothed milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including humans. Atylus tridens typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
