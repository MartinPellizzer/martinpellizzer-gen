    "intro": "Atriplex desertorum, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, green to grayish leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex desertorum also plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
