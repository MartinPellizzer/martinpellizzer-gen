    "intro": "Alchemilla murbeckiana, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters during the spring and early summer. Alchemilla murbeckiana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks."
