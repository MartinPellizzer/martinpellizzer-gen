    "intro": "Arenaria, commonly known as sandspurs, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. These plants are typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid regions. They are characterized by their low-growing habit, with small, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. Many species produce capsules that release seeds with hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal. Arenaria species are generally hardy and can thrive in poor soil conditions, making them common in disturbed or dry habitats."
