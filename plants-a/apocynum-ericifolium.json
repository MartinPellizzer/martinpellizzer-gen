    "intro": "Apocynum ericifolium, commonly known as the bearberry or red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woods and along streambanks. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a waxy coating, and the plant has a milky sap that is toxic to livestock. Apocynum ericifolium is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
