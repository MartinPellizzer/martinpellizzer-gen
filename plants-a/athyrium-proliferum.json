    "intro": "Athyrium proliferum, commonly known as the giant chain fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces numerous upright stems, each bearing a cluster of fertile fronds. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium proliferum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
