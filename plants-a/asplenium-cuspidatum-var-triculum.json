    "intro": "Asplenium cuspidatum var. triculum, commonly known as the three-toothed spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree bark in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a distinctive morphology, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with three prominent teeth at the base. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
