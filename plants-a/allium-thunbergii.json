    "intro": "Allium thunbergii, commonly known as Japanese garlic or threadleaf garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features basal leaves that are linear and grass-like, with a distinct garlic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white or purple flowers in early summer, followed by bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and delicate flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
