These plants are characterized by their unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Arisaema species are native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, and they often thrive in moist, shaded environments. Many species have strikingly colorful and intricate flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. Some arisaema species are cultivated for their ornamental value, while others are used in traditional medicine."
