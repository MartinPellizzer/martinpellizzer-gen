    "intro": "Astragalus incertus, commonly known as the uncertain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus incertus is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
