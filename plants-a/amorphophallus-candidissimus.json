It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix and a spathe. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies. Its underground corm serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought and regenerate in favorable conditions. The plant is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
