    "intro": "Andeimalva machupicchensis, commonly known as the Machu Picchu mallows, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a prominent central stigma. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climate of the Andean mountains. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
