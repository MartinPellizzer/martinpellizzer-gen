    "intro": "Acinodendron rugifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Acinodendron rugifolium is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories.",
