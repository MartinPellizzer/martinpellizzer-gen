    "intro": "Abrus fruticulosus, commonly known as the hairy spider plant, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supports, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three ovate to elliptical leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by distinctive, inflated pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. The seeds are coated in a bright red aril, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in open woodlands, savannas, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both moist and dry conditions. The species is known for its distinctive red seeds, which are often used in traditional practices. Its wide distribution across Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of South Asia highlights its ecological versatility.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus fruticulosus was mainly introduced to Brazil North, Brazil Northeast, Brazil West-Central, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Is., Philippines, and Suriname. It has been established in these regions, likely due to its adaptability to various tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and forest edges. Its introduction may have been unintentional, possibly through seed dispersal via human activities or natural means. This distribution highlights its potential ecological impact in these newly introduced regions."
