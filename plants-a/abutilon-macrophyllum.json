    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon macrophyllum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and parts of Georgia. It thrives in wetland habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant is commonly found in the Florida Panhandle and the coastal regions of the southeastern U.S. It prefers moist, sunny to partially shaded environments with rich, organic soil. Abutilon macrophyllum is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon macrophyllum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in wetland areas and along the edges of streams and rivers. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water. It has also been introduced to parts of California and Oregon. However, it is considered a non-native species in these regions and can sometimes outcompete native vegetation."
