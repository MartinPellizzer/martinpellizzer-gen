    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 sphenocookii, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium sphenocarpum. It is a compact, evergreen fern characterized by its dense, overlapping fronds that form a tight, shield-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rock crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, narrow, and lance-shaped appearance. Asplenium \u00d7 sphenocookii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
