    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. stolonifera, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
