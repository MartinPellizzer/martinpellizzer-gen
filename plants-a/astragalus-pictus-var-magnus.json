    "intro": "Astragalus pictus var. magnus, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spiny pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dry meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
