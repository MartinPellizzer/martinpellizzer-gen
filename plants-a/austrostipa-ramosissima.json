    "intro": "Austrostipa ramosissima, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and wiry, slender stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Austrostipa ramosissima plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small fauna in its native range."
