    "intro": "Artemisia mongolica var. leucophylla, commonly known as Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas. Due to its medicinal properties and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for use in traditional herbal remedies."
