    "intro": "Artocarpus ovatifolius var. dolichostachys, commonly known as the long-stalked breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Moraceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces edible fruits that are similar in appearance to breadfruit but have a distinct flavor. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree. The tree is valued for both its fruit and its role in traditional landscaping and agroforestry systems."
