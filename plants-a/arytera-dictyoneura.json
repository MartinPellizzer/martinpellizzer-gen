    "intro": "Arytera dictyoneura, commonly known as the lace fern, is a unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and often display a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in anchoring the plant while absorbing nutrients from the soil. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
