    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica f. micropetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled water plantain, is a variant of the water plantain species native to wetland environments. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic conditions. The flowers are small and white, arranged in dense spikes, and bloom in late summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its reduced petal size compared to the typical form, giving it a more delicate appearance. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
