It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. The plant is adapted to the warm and rainy climate typical of Haiti's lowland areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon picardae was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was brought there likely as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions of Hawaii, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its prolific seed production."
