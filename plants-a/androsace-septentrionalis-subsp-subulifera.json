    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis subsp. subulifera, commonly known as the northern alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to subulate, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitudes. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in harsh alpine environments."
