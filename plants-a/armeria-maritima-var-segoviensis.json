    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. segoviensis, commonly known as the Segovia thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that thrives in coastal and rocky environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate salt spray and poor soil conditions."
