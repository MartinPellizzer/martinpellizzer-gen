    "intro": "Apatostelis umbelliformis, commonly known as the umbrella-shaped fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that form a compact, umbrella-like structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid conditions."
