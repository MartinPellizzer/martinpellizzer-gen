    "intro": "Arenaria erinacea subsp. erinacea, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in the Mediterranean region. It features a compact rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and drought tolerance."
