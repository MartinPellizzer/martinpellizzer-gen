    "intro": "Astragalus exaltatus f. glaber, commonly known as the smooth astragalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. This subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stem, which sets it apart from other forms of Astragalus exaltatus."
