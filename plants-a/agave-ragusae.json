    "intro": "Agave ragusae, commonly known as the Ragusa agave, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Italy. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Agave ragusae is adapted to arid and rocky environments, storing water in its leaves to survive in drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
