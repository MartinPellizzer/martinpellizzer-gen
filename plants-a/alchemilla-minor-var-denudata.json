    "intro": "Alchemilla minor var. denudata, commonly known as the naked alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of silver-green, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. Due to its ornamental foliage and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a drought-tolerant ground cover."
