    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana var. douglasiana, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, blue to purple flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its distinctive scent and medicinal uses."
