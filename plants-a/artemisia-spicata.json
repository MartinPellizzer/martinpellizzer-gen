    "intro": "Artemisia spicata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces tiny, clustered flower heads that are often mistaken for seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Artemisia spicata is often used in traditional medicine and as a companion plant in gardens. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent."
