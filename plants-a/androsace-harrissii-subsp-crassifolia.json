    "intro": "Androsace harrissii subsp. crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with ovate to elliptic leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on slender stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high altitude and low temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
