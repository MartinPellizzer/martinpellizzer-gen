    "intro": "Aegiphila villosa, commonly known as the hairy aegiphila, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Aegiphila villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
