    "intro": "Arnica lonchophylla subsp. chionopappa, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers are composed of numerous tubular florets arranged in a compact, disc-like structure. This subspecies is valued for its medicinal properties, though it is often used in traditional remedies rather than commercial applications."
