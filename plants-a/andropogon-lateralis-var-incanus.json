    "intro": "Andropogon lateralis var. incanus, commonly known as the silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from the dense covering of fine, hair-like structures on its leaves. This grass typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering stems are usually erect and produce small, fluffy panicles that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
