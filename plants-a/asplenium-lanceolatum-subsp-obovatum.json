It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, lanceolate shape with a prominent midrib. It produces spores in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
