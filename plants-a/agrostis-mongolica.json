    "intro": "Agrostis mongolica, commonly known as Mongolian bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Mongolia and parts of China. It typically grows in open, dry, and often rocky habitats, including steppes and mountainous regions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agrostis mongolica is valued for its resilience to harsh environmental conditions and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
