    "intro": "Australopyrum calcis subsp. calcis, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal dunes and sandy soils, showing a high tolerance for saline and wind-blown conditions. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, pale green to brown flowers. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for native fauna."
