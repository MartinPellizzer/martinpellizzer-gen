    "intro": "Andenea gregeri, commonly known as the Gregers' orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant prefers warm, humid environments and is often found growing in shaded, moist forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to habitat loss, Andenea gregeri is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
