    "intro": "Androcymbium pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that come in shades of pink, purple, and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to thrive. Its unique floral structure includes a prominent, spurred labellum that plays a role in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
