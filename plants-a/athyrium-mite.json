    "intro": "Athyrium mite, commonly known as the Japanese painted fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to East Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that resemble a painted brush, with a distinctive blackish-brown central vein. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The botanical features of Athyrium mite make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and conservation efforts."
