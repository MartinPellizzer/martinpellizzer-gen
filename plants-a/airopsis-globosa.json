    "intro": "Airopsis globosa, commonly known as the globe wrack, is a marine algae belonging to the family Halymeniaceae. It is characterized by its spherical, gelatinous thallus that forms dense, floating mats in coastal waters. The plant has a simple structure with a central body and short, branched filaments, and it lacks true roots, stems, or leaves. It thrives in intertidal zones and is often found attached to submerged rocks or other substrates. Airopsis globosa plays a role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various small organisms."
