    "intro": "Athyrium lastreoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds, which are usually darker in color than the sterile ones. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
