    "intro": "Aristolochia debilis, commonly known as the Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should not be ingested."
