    "intro": "Arabis holboellii var. derensis, commonly known as the Alpine rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette shape, and are covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a hardy perennial in cooler climates."
