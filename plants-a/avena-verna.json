    "intro": "Avena verna, commonly known as false oat or spring oat, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, allowing for self-pollination. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it has a fibrous root system. Avena verna is often used as a forage crop and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
