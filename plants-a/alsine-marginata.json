    "intro": "Alsine marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically forms dense mats of small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize disturbed soils and rocky areas. Alsine marginata is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, drought-prone conditions."
