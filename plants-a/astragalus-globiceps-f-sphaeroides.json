It is characterized by its distinctive spherical or globular seed pods, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in regions of the western United States. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
