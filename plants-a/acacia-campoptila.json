    "intro": "Acacia campoptila, commonly known as the white wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators. Acacia campoptila is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia campoptila is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, woodlands, and rocky areas. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia campoptila plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals and insects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia campoptila was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide forage for livestock in semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. However, it has been reported to spread aggressively and potentially outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to both ecological benefits and management challenges in some areas."
