    "intro": "Asplenium trilobatum, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive three-lobed structure at the base. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the leaf margins, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Asplenium trilobatum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
