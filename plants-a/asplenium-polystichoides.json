    "intro": "Asplenium polystichoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or granite substrates. The plant has a compact, rosette-like growth habit with fronds that are deeply divided and resemble those of other asplenium species. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, shaded conditions."
