    "intro": "Acrostichum thalictroides, commonly known as the golden thread fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often bright green with a slight golden hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its fronds. Acrostichum thalictroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
