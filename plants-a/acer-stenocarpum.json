    "intro": "Acer stenocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, narrow, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rainforests or along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife.",
