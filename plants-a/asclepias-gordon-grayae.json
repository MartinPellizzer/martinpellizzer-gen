    "intro": "Asclepias gordon-grayae, commonly known as Gordon's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the genus Asclepias and contains toxic compounds. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This species is an important host plant for monarch butterflies and other pollinators."
