It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a tuberous root system that stores starch. Its flowers are typically small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is valued for its starchy roots, which are used in traditional cuisines and as a source of carbohydrates."
