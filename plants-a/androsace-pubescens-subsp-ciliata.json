    "intro": "Androsace pubescens subsp. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy rockfoam, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
