    "intro": "Astragalus eriocephalus subsp. haussknechtianus, commonly known as the Sierra foothill milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and meadows. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators."
