    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. truncata, commonly known as the blunt-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features rosettes of rounded, gray-green leaves that are shorter and broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is known for its ability to retain moisture, making it a hardy and drought-resistant plant."
