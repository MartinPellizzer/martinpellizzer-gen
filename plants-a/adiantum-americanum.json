    "intro": "Adiantum americanum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a finely divided appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots that help stabilize the soil. Adiantum americanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions.",
