    "intro": "Adenostylis arisanensis, commonly known as the Arisan adenostylis, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Adenostylis arisanensis is typically found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and rocky slopes.",
