    "intro": "Astragalus mattam var. mattam, commonly known as the Indian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The seeds are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
