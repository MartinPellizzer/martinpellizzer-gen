    "intro": "Alsine michauxii, commonly known as the Michaux's sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing annual or biennial species that typically thrives in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitats. Alsine michauxii is often found in open areas such as roadsides, fields, and dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators."
