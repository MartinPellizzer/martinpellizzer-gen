It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of trichomes. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium kapplerianum is known for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well adapted to its moist, shaded habitats."
