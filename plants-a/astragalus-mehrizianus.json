    "intro": "Astragalus mehrizianus, commonly known as the Mehriz milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. Astragalus mehrizianus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and as a forage plant for livestock."
