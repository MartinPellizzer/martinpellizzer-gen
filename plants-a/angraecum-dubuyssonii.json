    "intro": "Angraecum dubuyssonii, commonly known as the Dubuysson's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with dark green, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces pendulous, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent moisture and good air circulation. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments."
