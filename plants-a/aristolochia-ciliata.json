    "intro": "Aristolochia ciliata, commonly known as the fringed Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with ciliate (fringed) margins and produces striking, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which resembles a pipe or a hollow tube, and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
