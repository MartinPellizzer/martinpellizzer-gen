    "intro": "Asclepias vincetoxicum, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of vibrant orange to yellow flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to some animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias vincetoxicum plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
