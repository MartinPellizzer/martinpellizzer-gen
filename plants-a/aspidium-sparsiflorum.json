    "intro": "Aspidium sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi-lobed and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium sparsiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
