    "intro": "Astragalus molestus, commonly known as the sicklepod milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus molestus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
