    "intro": "Aegochloa atractyloides, commonly known as purple false brome, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and bluish-green foliage that turns a striking purple in the fall. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes used in restoration projects."
