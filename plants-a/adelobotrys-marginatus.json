It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, and it is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and clearings. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in warmer climates.",
