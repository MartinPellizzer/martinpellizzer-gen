    "intro": "Antennaria borealis, commonly known as the northern mouse-eared moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tiny, hairy leaves and clustered yellow flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to extreme cold and strong winds. Its small stature and dense growth habit help it conserve heat and reduce desiccation. Antennaria borealis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
