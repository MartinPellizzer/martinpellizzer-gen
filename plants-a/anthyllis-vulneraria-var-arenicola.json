    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria var. arenicola, commonly known as the sand everlasting or coastal anthyllis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal and sandy habitats in Europe and North Africa. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has compact, creeping stems with small, leathery leaves adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Its root system is deep and resilient, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This variety is well-suited to maritime environments and is often found in dunes and rocky shores."
