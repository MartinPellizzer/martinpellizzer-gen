    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon terminale var. islae-malae is primarily native to the island of Isla Malae, which is part of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands in Ecuador. This variant of the species is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos, including its volcanic soil and maritime climate. It is commonly found in coastal areas and dry forests, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various native species. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon terminale var. islae-malae was mainly introduced to areas with a warm, temperate climate that supports its growth habits. It is commonly found in regions with well-drained soils and moderate to high levels of sunlight. This plant has been introduced to several parts of the world, including the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. Its introduction is often associated with ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
