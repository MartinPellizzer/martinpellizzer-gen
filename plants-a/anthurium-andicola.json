    "intro": "Anthurium andicola, commonly known as the Andean arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the true flowers. Anthurium andicola thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
