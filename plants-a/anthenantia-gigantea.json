    "intro": "Anthenantia gigantea, commonly known as the giant angel's tears, is a strikingly tall plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It features large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in the spring. Its roots are deep and robust, allowing it to access moisture from underground water sources. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
