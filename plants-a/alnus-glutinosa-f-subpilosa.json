    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa f. subpilosa, commonly known as the silky alder, is a subspecies of the European alder characterized by its finely hairy leaves and bark. It is a deciduous tree or shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils along riverbanks and wetlands. Its small, yellowish-green catkins appear in early spring, followed by small, oval berries in late summer. The subspecies is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
