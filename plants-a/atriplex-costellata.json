    "intro": "Atriplex costellata, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spiky inflorescences. It is often found growing in sandy soils, along coastal dunes, and in disturbed areas. Atriplex costellata is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
