    "intro": "Artemisia aquatica, commonly known as yellow wormwood, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Asia, Europe, and North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, wetlands, and disturbed areas. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia aquatica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported antispasmodic and antiparasitic effects."
