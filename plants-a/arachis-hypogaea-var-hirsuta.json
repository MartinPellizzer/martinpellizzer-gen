    "intro": "Arachis hypogaea var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy peanut, is a variant of the peanut plant characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. It is native to South America and thrives in warm, tropical climates. The plant produces underground pods that contain edible seeds, which are rich in protein and oil. Its hairy foliage distinguishes it from other peanut varieties and may aid in moisture retention. This variety is often cultivated for both its nutritional value and agricultural resilience."
