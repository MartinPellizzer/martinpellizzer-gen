    "intro": "Asplenium cicutarium var. monteverdense, commonly known as the Monteverde spleenwort, is a fern species native to the humid cloud forests of Central America. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments on tree trunks and branches. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. This variety is notable for its adaptability to high-altitude conditions and its role in the biodiversity of montane ecosystems."
