    "intro": "Arctium squarrosum, commonly known as the hispid hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its fruit is a spiny, burr-like structure that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Arctium squarrosum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
