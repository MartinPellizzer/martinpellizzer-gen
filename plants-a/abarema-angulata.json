    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema angulata is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the tropical regions of the country, especially in the states of Par\u00e1, Amazonas, and Mato Grosso. This plant thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil, often in the understory of dense rainforests. It is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest and Amazonian ecosystems. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema angulata was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been cultivated in various regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. However, it has also been reported to escape cultivation and establish itself in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has led to discussions about its ecological impact and management in the regions where it has become naturalized. Despite its ornamental appeal, further studies are needed to fully understand its distribution and effects on local ecosystems."
