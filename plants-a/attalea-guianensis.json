    "intro": "Attalea guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese palm, is a tall, slender palm native to South America, particularly found in the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves and can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant produces yellowish-orange flowers that develop into clusters of small, oval fruits. The fruits are edible and contain a single seed, which is used for propagation. Its fibrous trunk is valued for its strength and is often harvested for construction and craft purposes."
