It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish flower heads that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. It has a strong, camphor-like scent and is known for its medicinal properties. This variety is closely related to other artemisia species and is valued for its adaptability to harsh maritime environments."
