    "intro": "Agave caribaeicola, commonly known as the Caribbean agave, is a species native to the Caribbean region, particularly found in the islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence bearing yellowish-green flowers, which are typically pollinated by bats and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional practices, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
