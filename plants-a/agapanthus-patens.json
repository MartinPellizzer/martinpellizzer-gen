    "intro": "Agapanthus patens, commonly known as the African lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking blue to purple flower heads that bloom in summer, composed of numerous small, tubular flowers arranged in a dense spherical shape. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that are narrow and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
