    "intro": "Armeria eriophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with dense clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Armeria eriophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
