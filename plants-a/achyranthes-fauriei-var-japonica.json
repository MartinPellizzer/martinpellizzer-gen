It is characterized by its stout, bamboo-like stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by dark, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is known for its aggressive growth habit. Due to its rapid spread, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range.",
