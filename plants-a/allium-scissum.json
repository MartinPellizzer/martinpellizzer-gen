    "intro": "Allium scissum, commonly known as shreds-of-marrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant produces bulbils along its flower stems, which can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Allium scissum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
