    "intro": "Anguloa, commonly known as the \"angel's tears,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru. Anguloa species are characterized by their showy, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plants typically grow as terrestrial herbs or small shrubs, with tuberous roots that store nutrients. They thrive in cool, humid environments and are often found in cloud forests at high elevations."
