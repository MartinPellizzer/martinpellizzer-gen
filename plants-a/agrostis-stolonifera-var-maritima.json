It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading growth habit and silver-blue foliage. The plant produces dense, tufted inflorescences that are often tinged with pink or red. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. This variety plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion along coastlines."
