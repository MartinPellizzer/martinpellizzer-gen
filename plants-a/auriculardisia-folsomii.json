    "intro": "Auriculardisia folsomii, commonly known as the Folsom's auricula, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking, auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, blooming during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
