    "intro": "Asplenium decurtatum, commonly known as the cut-leaf spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen leaves that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium decurtatum is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
