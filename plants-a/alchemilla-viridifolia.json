    "intro": "Alchemilla viridifolia, commonly known as greenleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with silver or white on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage is often used in herbal remedies and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
