    "intro": "Asclepias dissona, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its striking, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many herbivores but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias dissona thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks."
