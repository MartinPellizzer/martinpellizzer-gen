It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as bloom. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its delicate appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
