    "intro": "Adinandra bancana, commonly known as the Borneo ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and sturdy, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, round fruits containing a single seed. Adinandra bancana is typically found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, growing up to 30 meters in height. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
