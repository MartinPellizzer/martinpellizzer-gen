It features striking purple to blue flowers arranged in a hooded shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrangement of veins. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it requires careful handling and is not suitable for cultivation in home gardens.",
