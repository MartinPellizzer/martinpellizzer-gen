    "intro": "Aleuritopteris pseudofarinosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered with small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait may vary among variants. The glandular structures on its leaves are thought to play a role in moisture retention and defense against herbivores."
