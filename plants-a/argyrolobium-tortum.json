    "intro": "Argyrolobium tortum, commonly known as the twisted silver globular veldt. It is a flowering plant native to South Africa, characterized by its distinctive silver-green foliage and spherical growth habit. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the warmer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
