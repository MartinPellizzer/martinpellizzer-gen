    "intro": "Amyema francii, commonly known as the silky wattle, is a small evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost silky appearance. The plant produces small yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in compact spherical inflorescences. Amyema francii is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
