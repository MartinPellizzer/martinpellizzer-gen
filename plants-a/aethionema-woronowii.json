    "intro": "Aethionema woronowii, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Aethionema woronowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
