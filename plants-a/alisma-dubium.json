    "intro": "Alisma dubium, commonly known as the water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Alisma dubium is also used in traditional medicine for its purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties."
