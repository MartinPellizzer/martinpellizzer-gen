    "intro": "Achillea ageratifolia f. linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a horticultural form of the yarrow plant. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. This variety is more compact than the typical yarrow, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders.",
