    "intro": "Astragalus hyalolepidoides, commonly known as the white-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its root system is often deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus hyalolepidoides is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
