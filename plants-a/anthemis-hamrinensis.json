    "intro": "Anthemis hamrinensis, commonly known as the Hamrin sandweed, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Its small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
