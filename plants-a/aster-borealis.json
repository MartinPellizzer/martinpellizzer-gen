It features showy blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Aster borealis plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
