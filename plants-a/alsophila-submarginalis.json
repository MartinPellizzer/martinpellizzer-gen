    "intro": "Alsophila submarginalis, commonly known as the marginal tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a striking and ecologically significant plant in its natural habitat."
