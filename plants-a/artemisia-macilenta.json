    "intro": "Artemisia macilenta, commonly known as the slender wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Artemisia macilenta is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in harsh environments. It is also used in traditional medicine by Indigenous peoples for its purported therapeutic properties."
