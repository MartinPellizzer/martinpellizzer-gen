    "intro": "Armeria chilensis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the Chilean sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Chile. It features compact, mat-forming growth with dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. This plant is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
