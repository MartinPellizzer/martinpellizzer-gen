    "intro": "Anisomeria coriacea var. petulifera, commonly known as the roughleaf anisomeria, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique foliage and drought tolerance make it an interesting subject for botanical study and a potential ornamental plant."
