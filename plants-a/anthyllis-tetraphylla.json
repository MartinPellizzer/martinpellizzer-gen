    "intro": "Anthyllis tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaved clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, typically found in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets, though the common name suggests a four-leaf variant, which is rare. Anthyllis tetraphylla is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and historical significance."
