    "intro": "Asplenium capillipes, commonly known as the hairy spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium capillipes is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
