    "intro": "Acalypha tenuicaulis, commonly known as slender-stemmed glorybower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, clustered inflorescences that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along streambanks. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth or slightly hairy surface.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuicaulis is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This plant thrives in lowland areas and is frequently associated with forest understories. It is also present in parts of tropical Africa and the Pacific Islands. Its distribution is closely linked to humid climates with high rainfall and warm temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha tenuicaulis was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant has been reported in several countries including Australia, Hawaii, and parts of Southeast Asia. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about its ecological impact in non-native habitats."
