    "intro": "Acer davidii, commonly known as the David's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with two distinct wings. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and parks for its striking autumn foliage.",
