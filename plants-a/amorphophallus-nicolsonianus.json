It features large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant produces showy, white to purple flowers that bloom at night, releasing a strong odor to attract pollinators. Its roots form a dense network beneath the water, helping to stabilize the ecosystem. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
