    "intro": "Aphyllocladus denticulatus var. calvus, commonly known as the smooth-leafed sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its smooth, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that are typically covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and for its ornamental value in landscaping."
