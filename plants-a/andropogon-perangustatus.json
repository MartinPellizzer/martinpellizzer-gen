    "intro": "Andropogon perangustatus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon perangustatus is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support native wildlife."
