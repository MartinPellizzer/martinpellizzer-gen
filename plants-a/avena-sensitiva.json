    "intro": "Avena sensitiva, commonly known as sensitive oat, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and slender stalks. The plant is known for its rapid response to touch, as its leaves curl when disturbed, a trait that gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Avena sensitiva is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its potential ecological benefits in supporting local wildlife."
