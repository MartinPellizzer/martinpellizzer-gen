    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius f. bulbosum, commonly known as the bulbous wood grass, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland margins. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and dense inflorescences of spikelets. Its distinctive feature is the presence of bulbils on the stems, which contribute to its vegetative propagation. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
