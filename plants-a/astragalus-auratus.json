    "intro": "Astragalus auratus, commonly known as the golden milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Astragalus auratus has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
