    "intro": "Apocaulon carnosum, commonly known as the woolly false heath, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically thick and covered in a fine, cottony layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Apocaulon carnosum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions."
