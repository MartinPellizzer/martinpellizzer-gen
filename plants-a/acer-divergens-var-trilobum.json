    "intro": "Acer divergens var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a variant of the red maple species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and often have a striking red or orange hue in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and the small, red samaras that appear in the spring. This variety is valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions.",
