    "intro": "Athyriopsis longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed shield fern, is a species of fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a thin, papery covering. Athyriopsis longipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
