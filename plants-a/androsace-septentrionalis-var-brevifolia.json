    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. brevifolia, commonly known as the northern sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of northern Europe. It features a dense mat of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are typically short and broad. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variety is distinguished by its shorter leaf blades compared to other varieties within the species."
