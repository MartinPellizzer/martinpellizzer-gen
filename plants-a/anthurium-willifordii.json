    "intro": "Anthurium willifordii, commonly known as the Williford's anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spathes that can range in color from red to orange, often with a contrasting white or yellow lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium willifordii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
