It consists of several species, most of which are native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They are often found growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Anisochilus species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
