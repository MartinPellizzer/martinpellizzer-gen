    "intro": "Acacia gonophylla var. crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf-like structures that reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Acacia gonophylla var. crassifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gonophylla var. crassifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, South Australia, and northern New South Wales. It is commonly found in sandy soils along coastal dunes, inland sandplains, and rocky outcrops. This variety is well adapted to drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of the local flora. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native fauna. Its distribution is largely restricted to these specific environmental conditions across the Australian continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gonophylla var. crassifolia was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and saline environments due to its tolerance for poor soil conditions. This plant has been introduced to parts of southern Australia, including Western Australia and South Australia. It is often used for stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly."
