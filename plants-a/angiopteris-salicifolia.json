    "intro": "Angiopteris salicifolia, commonly known as the willow fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble the leaves of willow trees, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping underground stems that produce new shoots. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a light green color and a finely divided structure. Angiopteris salicifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
