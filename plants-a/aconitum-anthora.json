    "intro": "Aconitum anthora, commonly known as the Alpine monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers that resemble a monk's habit, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately compound, with a distinctive shape that sets it apart from other members of the Ranunculaceae family. Aconitum anthora contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.",
