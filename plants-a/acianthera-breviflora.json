    "intro": "Acianthera breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, facilitating efficient water retention. Acianthera breviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements.",
