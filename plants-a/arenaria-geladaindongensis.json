    "intro": "Arenaria geladaindongensis, commonly known as the Geladaindong sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Its low-growing habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it well adapted to its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
