    "intro": "Anthurium umbricola var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock anthurium, is a unique variant of the Anthurium genus native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. This plant is characterized by its dark, velvety foliage and striking, spathaceous inflorescences that range in color from deep red to orange. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. The leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a textured surface that enhances its ornamental appeal. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a rare indoor plant."
