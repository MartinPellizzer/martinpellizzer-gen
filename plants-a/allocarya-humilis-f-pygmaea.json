    "intro": "Allocarya humilis f. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, making it well-suited for rocky or alpine environments. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often prostrate. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates."
