It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its small, pod-like fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind."
