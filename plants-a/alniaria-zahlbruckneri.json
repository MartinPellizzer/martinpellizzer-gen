    "intro": "Alniaria zahlbruckneri, commonly known as the Zahler's alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, which includes birches and alders, and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it is adapted to cold, dry climates with limited nutrient availability. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
