    "intro": "Asplenium arisanense, commonly known as the Arisan shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped outline, which gives it its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
