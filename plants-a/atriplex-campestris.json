    "intro": "Atriplex campestris, commonly known as tumbleweed, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to many other regions. The plant is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and its ability to produce a large, dry, wind-dispersed seed head. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Atriplex campestris is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain areas."
