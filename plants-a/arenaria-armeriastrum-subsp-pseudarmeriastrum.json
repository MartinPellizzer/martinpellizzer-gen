    "intro": "Arenaria armeriastrum subsp. pseudarmeriastrum, commonly known as the coastal sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western coast of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference compared to other members of the species."
