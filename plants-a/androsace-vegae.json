    "intro": "Androsace vegae, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are usually fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Androsace vegae is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates."
