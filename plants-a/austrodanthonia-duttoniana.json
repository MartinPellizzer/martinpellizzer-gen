    "intro": "Austrodanthonia duttoniana, commonly known as Dutton's wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Austrodanthonia duttoniana is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
