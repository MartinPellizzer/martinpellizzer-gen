It features large, showy white flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. The plant has broad, floating leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, providing shade and habitat for aquatic life. Its rhizome system allows it to spread rapidly in still water, making it a common invasive species in some regions. Botanically, it belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure."
