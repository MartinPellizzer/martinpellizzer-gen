    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus var. brevisetus, commonly known as the short-haired arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, tufted foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the leaf sheaths, making it less conspicuous. This variety is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats."
