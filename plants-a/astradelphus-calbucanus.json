    "intro": "Astradelphus calbucanus, commonly known as the mountain starflower, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow. Its flowering period occurs in the spring, and it is often found in association with other alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
