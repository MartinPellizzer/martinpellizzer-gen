    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum f. tricolor is primarily native to the Cappadocia region of Turkey. This plant is also found in parts of northern Syria and southeastern Anatolia. It thrives in mountainous areas with a temperate climate. The species is commonly found in rocky and limestone soils at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. Its native distribution is limited to specific regions in the eastern Mediterranean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum f. tricolor was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its striking variegated foliage. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates where it thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant's unique coloration makes it a popular choice for ornamental planting in both public and private spaces. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in natural habitats. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interest rather than ecological necessity."
