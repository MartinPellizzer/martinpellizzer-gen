    "intro": "Agave huehueteca, commonly known as the sacred agave, is a striking plant native to the highlands of central Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of thick, blue-green leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces an impressive inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom once in its lifetime, typically after several years of growth. Its leaves are fibrous and contain a high concentration of sap, which has been historically used by indigenous peoples for various purposes. Agave huehueteca is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
