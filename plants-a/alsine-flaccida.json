    "intro": "Alsine flaccida, commonly known as the common sand-verbena, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically has small, oval to lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important species in xerophytic plant communities."
