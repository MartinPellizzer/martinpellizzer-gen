It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its foliage consists of opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Ageratina acevedoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinators."
