    "intro": "Adiantum capillus, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and prefers well-draining soil. Adiantum capillus has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and ecological garden settings.",
