    "intro": "Agropyron maritimum, commonly known as sea barleygrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to salty and windy environments, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. Its hardy nature makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing sandy soils along shorelines."
