    "intro": "Artemisia tristis, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray, aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. Artemisia tristis is often found in dry, disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy environments. It is used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent due to its chemical compounds."
