    "intro": "Astragalus bor-bulakensis, commonly known as the Bulakensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
