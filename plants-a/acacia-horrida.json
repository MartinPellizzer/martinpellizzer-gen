    "intro": "Acacia horrida, commonly known as the rough acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Acacia horrida is well adapted to dry climates, with deep roots that allow it to survive in harsh, sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various desert animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia horrida is primarily native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is commonly found in savanna and shrubland ecosystems. This plant is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open grasslands. Acacia horrida plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia horrida was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species in certain regions. It was likely brought there for its potential use in soil stabilization or as a source of timber. However, its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation have led to ecological concerns. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread quickly along roadsides and in agricultural areas. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local biodiversity."
