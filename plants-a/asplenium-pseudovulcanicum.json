    "intro": "Asplenium pseudovulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to specific volcanic regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or in shaded, humid environments, often in areas with volcanic soil. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
