    "intro": "Ampelocissus macrocirrha, commonly known as the large-fruited cat's claw, is a climbing vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces small, greenish-white flowers. The plant is notable for its large, fleshy berries that turn red when mature. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, often trailing over supports or climbing trees. Ampelocissus macrocirrha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
