    "intro": "Antennaria howellii f. concolor, commonly known as the Howell's sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green or bluish-gray in color. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dryland habitats."
