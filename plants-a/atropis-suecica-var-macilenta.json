    "intro": "Atropis suecica var. macilenta, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cold regions of northern Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine or arctic environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
