It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its showy blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
