    "intro": "Adenotrias, commonly known as the flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vivid orange-red bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Adenotrias is typically propagated through stem cuttings, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation."
