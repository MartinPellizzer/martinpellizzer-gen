    "intro": "Agropyron transcaucasicum, commonly known as the Transcaucasian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, and nutrient-poor soils. Agropyron transcaucasicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
