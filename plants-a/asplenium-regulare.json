    "intro": "Asplenium regulare, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern that thrives in rocky or calcareous environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in crevices or on rock surfaces, where it forms dense mats or clusters. Its sporangia are clustered in sori along the margins of the leaves, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium regulare is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ability to colonize difficult habitats."
