    "intro": "Amygdalus amara var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping almond, is a variant of the bitter almond tree characterized by its cascading branches that droop gracefully. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. The plant produces small, white flowers in early spring, followed by edible almonds, though they are often bitter due to the presence of hydrocyanic acid. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens. Its distinctive appearance and seasonal blooms make it a striking addition to landscapes."
