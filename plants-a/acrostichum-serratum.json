    "intro": "Acrostichum serratum, commonly known as the serrated fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feather-like fronds that are serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrostichum serratum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals.",
