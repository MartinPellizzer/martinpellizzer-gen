It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features trifoliate leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open to release the seeds. This species is often found in woodland and grassland habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
