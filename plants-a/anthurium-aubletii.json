    "intro": "Anthurium aubletii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a brightly colored spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in high humidity and indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the year under proper care."
