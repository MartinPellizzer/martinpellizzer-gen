    "intro": "Acer syriacum var. hermoneum, commonly known as the Hermoneum maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Syriac maple. It is native to the mountainous regions of eastern Turkey and northern Syria, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
