    "intro": "Astragalus forwoodii, commonly known as the Forwood milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinators. Astragalus forwoodii is also valued for its potential medicinal properties in traditional herbal practices."
