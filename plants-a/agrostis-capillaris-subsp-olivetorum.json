It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on dry, sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to well-drained environments and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ecological role includes soil stabilization and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
