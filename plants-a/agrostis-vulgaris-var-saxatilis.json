    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. saxatilis, commonly known as the saxifrage grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and coastal environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, including high altitudes and salt spray. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in rocky landscapes."
