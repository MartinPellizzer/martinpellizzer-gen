    "intro": "Aristida pseudochiclayensis, commonly known as the Chiclayo grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America, particularly found in Peru and Ecuador. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
