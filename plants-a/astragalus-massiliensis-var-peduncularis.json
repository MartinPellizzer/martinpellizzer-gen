    "intro": "Astragalus massiliensis var. peduncularis, commonly known as the Marseille milkvetch, is a rare leguminous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
