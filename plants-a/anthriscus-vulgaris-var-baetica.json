It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white, umbellate flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 60\u2013120 cm and prefers well-drained, sunny to partially shaded soils. It is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Apiaceae family, sharing similarities with other members like parsley and carrots."
