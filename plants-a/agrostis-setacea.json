    "intro": "Agrostis setacea, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns and has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis setacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant gardens."
