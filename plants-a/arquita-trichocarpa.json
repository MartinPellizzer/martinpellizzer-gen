    "intro": "Arquita trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, which are typical of the Salicaceae family. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Arquita trichocarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands."
