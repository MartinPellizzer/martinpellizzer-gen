    "intro": "Anthemis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable anthemis, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are often variable in shape, hence the species name *heterophylla*, meaning \"different leaves.\" The yellow flowers bloom in spring and are often visited by bees and other pollinators."
