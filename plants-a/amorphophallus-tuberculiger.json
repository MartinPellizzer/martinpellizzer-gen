    "intro": "Amorphophallus tuberculiger, commonly known as the giant tuberous amorphophallus, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, starchy underground tuber, which can weigh several kilograms. The plant produces a tall, leafy stem with a single, large, white or pinkish flower that resembles a phallic shape, hence its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The tuber is not only a botanical curiosity but also has traditional uses in some cultures."
