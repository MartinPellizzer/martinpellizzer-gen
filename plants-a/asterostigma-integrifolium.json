    "intro": "Asterostigma integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaf asterostigma, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and unlobed. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, often in shades of white or pale purple. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
