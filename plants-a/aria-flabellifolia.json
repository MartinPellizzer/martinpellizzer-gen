    "intro": "Aria flabellifolia, commonly known as the fan-leaf arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble a fan, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, containing starch that is used in cooking. Aria flabellifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or near streams."
