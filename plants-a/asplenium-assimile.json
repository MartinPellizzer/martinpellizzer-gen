    "intro": "Asplenium assimile, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or other calcareous substrates. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium assimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
