    "intro": "Alectryon mollis, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, ovate leaves that are covered in a fine, silky white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, smooth seeds. Alectryon mollis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry, well-drained soils."
