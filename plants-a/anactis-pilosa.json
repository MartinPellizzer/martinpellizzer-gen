    "intro": "Anactis pilosa, commonly known as the hairy panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy, thread-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Anactis pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
