    "intro": "Astragalus scholerianus, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems, compound leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found at high altitudes. Astragalus scholerianus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
