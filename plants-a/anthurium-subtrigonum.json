    "intro": "Anthurium subtrigonum, commonly known as the triangular anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces vibrant red spathes that enclose its spadix, a feature typical of many Anthurium species. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Due to its ornamental value, it is widely cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens."
