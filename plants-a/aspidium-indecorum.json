    "intro": "Aspidium indecorum, commonly known as the false fern, is a member of the family Athyriaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous structure, with fronds that are divided into pinnae, giving it a fern-like appearance. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium indecorum is characterized by its delicate, often pale green foliage and is often found in temperate regions."
