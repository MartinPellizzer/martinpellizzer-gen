    "intro": "Aristida echinulata, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for wildlife."
