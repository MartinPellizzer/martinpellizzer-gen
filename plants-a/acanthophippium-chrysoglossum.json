    "intro": "Acanthophippium chrysoglossum, commonly known as the golden-leafed acanthophippium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a shiny appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically in whorls, and are usually pink or purple in color. Acanthophippium chrysoglossum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.",

The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments within these ecosystems. It is commonly associated with primary forest habitats. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within Sumatera due to its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium chrysoglossum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activities such as horticulture and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and areas with disturbed vegetation, often thriving in urban and suburban environments. This plant has shown adaptability to a variety of soil types and climatic conditions, which contributes to its spread. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain regions. However, it is currently considered a non-native species with limited ecological impact in most areas."
