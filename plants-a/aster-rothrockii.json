    "intro": "Aster rothrockii, commonly known as Rothrock's aster, is a flowering plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It is a perennial herb with upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, wooded habitats and is often found in rocky or streamside areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
