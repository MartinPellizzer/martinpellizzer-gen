    "intro": "Athyrium arcuatum, commonly known as the curl-leaf millefleur, is a fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy coating, contributing to its common name. The spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
