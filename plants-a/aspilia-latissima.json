    "intro": "Aspilia latissima, commonly known as the broadleaf euphorbia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, upright stems and bright yellow cyathia, which are specialized flower-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance. Aspilia latissima thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
