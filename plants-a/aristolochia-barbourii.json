    "intro": "Aristolochia barbourii, commonly known as the Barbour's Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet scent. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
