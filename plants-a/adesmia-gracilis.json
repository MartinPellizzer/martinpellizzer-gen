It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, edible seeds. Adesmia gracilis is often used in traditional medicine and can thrive in dry, rocky soils.",
