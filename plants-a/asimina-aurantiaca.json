    "intro": "Asimina aurantiaca, commonly known as the red-fruited custard apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red, fleshy berries. Its fruits are edible, though often considered too tart for widespread consumption, and are used in local cuisines. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
