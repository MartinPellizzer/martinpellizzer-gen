It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are red and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Alaticaulia sanguinea is native to parts of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests."
