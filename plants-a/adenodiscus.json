    "intro": "Adenodiscus, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. The plants are characterized by their palmate leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. They often have a milky sap and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Adenodiscus species are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
