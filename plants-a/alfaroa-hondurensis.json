    "intro": "Alfaroa hondurensis, commonly known as the Honduras alfaroa, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
