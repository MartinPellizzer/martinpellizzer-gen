    "intro": "Alsine cerastiifolia var. laxa, commonly known as the lax alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ability to withstand harsh conditions, it is a hardy species well adapted to cold climates."
