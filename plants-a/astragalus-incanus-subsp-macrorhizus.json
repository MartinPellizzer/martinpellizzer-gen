    "intro": "Astragalus incanus subsp. macrorhizus, commonly known as the large-rooted milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This subspecies is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
