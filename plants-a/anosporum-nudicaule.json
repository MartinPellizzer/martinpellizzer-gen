It is characterized by its slender, unbranched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant is typically found in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. It produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged or nearly so. Anosporum nudicaule is a carnivorous plant, using its specialized structures to trap and digest small aquatic invertebrates."
