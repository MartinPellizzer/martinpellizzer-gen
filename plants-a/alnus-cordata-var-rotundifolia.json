    "intro": "Alnus cordata var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its ovate to round leaves, which are often pubescent and have a distinct cordate base. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along streambanks. It produces small, clustered flowers followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its ability to thrive in disturbed environments."
