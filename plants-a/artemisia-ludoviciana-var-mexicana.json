    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage composed of narrow, linear leaves that are densely covered with fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its strong scent, it is often used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
