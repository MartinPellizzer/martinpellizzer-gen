    "intro": "Alsinidendron, commonly known as the African snowball, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of white, fluffy flowers that resemble small snowballs, blooming in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. Alsinidendron is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
