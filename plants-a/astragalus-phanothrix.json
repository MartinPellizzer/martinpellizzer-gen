    "intro": "Astragalus phanothrix, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus phanothrix plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native range."
