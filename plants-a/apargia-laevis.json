    "intro": "Apargia laevis, commonly known as the smooth apargia, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has a taproot system that allows it to thrive in shaded environments. Its flowers are white to pale green and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Apargia laevis is often found in association with other woodland flora and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect life."
