It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root nodules. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of white or pale purple. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Adesmia wallichiana is adapted to cold, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing mountainous soils.",
