    "intro": "Acalypha langiana var. vigens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-leaved acalypha, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant, velvety foliage that ranges from deep red to purple, providing a dramatic visual impact in gardens. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its unique leaf coloration.",

This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mexican states, particularly in the southern and western parts. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. The species is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. It is a shrub-like plant that plays an important ecological role in its local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha langiana var. vigens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. The distribution of this plant has been primarily confined to the North Island, where it has been cultivated in gardens and public spaces. Despite its ornamental value, it has not become invasive in the wild. Its presence in New Zealand highlights the role of human activity in the spread of non-native plant species."
