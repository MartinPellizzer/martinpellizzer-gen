It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is known for its succulent characteristics and adaptations to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss.
