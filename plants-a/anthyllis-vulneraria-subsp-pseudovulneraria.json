    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. pseudovulneraria, commonly known as the false woundwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which helps it thrive in nutrient-poor environments. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
