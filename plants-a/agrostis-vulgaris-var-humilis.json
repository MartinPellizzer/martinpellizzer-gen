    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. humilis, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with fine, narrow leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in ecological restoration projects."
