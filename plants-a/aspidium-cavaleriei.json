    "intro": "Aspidium cavaleriei, commonly known as the Chinese shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous small, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Aspidium cavaleriei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
