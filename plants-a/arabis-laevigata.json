    "intro": "Arabis laevigata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and arranged in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value in garden settings."
