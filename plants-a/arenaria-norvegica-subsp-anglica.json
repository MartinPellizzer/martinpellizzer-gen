It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in racemes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize loose soils in ecological restoration projects."
