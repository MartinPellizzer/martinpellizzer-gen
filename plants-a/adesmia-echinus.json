It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow or white flowers followed by elongated, spiny pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall. Adesmia echinus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert animals.",
