    "intro": "Andropogon schlumbergeri, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Sweet grass is known for its aromatic fragrance, which is released when the leaves are crushed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks."
