    "intro": "Androcymbium walteri, commonly known as the Walter's orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of central Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate and showy floral structure. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption in its rocky habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
