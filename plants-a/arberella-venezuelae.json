    "intro": "Arberella venezuelae, commonly known as the Venezuelan arberella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Venezuela. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and cloud forests. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
