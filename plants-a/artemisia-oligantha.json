    "intro": "Artemisia oligantha, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia oligantha is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. It contains essential oils and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its aromatic and antimicrobial properties."
