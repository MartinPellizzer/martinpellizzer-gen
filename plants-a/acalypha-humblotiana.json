    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha humblotiana is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid lowland rainforests. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. It is known for its striking foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. However, it remains most abundant in its native habitat within Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha humblotiana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habits. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscapes. The plant has been spread through the trade of ornamental plants, leading to its establishment in several non-native areas. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, it is not considered a major threat in most regions where it is currently grown."
