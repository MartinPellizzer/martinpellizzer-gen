    "intro": "Allium subakaka, commonly known as the Kauai onion, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in clusters, which bloom during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in wet forest habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Allium subakaka is considered a vulnerable species."
