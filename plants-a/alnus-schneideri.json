    "intro": "Alnus schneideri, commonly known as the Schneider's alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and clusters of yellowish catkins that appear in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along streambanks. It plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Alnus schneideri is also capable of fixing nitrogen through its symbiotic relationship with Frankia bacteria, enhancing soil fertility."
