    "intro": "Amyema fenicis, commonly known as the flame tree, is a species of flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through its root nodules. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller leaflets, and the tree can grow quite tall, reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Amyema fenicis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
