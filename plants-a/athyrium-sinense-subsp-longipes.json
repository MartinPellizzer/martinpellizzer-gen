    "intro": "Athyrium sinense subsp. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady fern, is a perennial fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching and gracefully tapered. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns."
