    "intro": "Anemone pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of only 3 to 6 inches, featuring delicate, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Anemone pygmaea is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense colonies over time."
