    "intro": "Asperula stricta var. scabrida, commonly known as the scabrous evergreen holly, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, bristly hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
