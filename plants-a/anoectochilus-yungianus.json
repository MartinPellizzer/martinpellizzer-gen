    "intro": "Anoectochilus yungianus, commonly known as the Yungiang orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of Yunnan, China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a single, fleshy leaf. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a spike, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is highly sought after in the horticultural trade, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
