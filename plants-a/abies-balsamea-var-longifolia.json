    "intro": "Abies balsamea var. longifolia, commonly known as the Canadian fir, is a variant of the balsam fir native to eastern Canada and the northeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are slightly longer than those of the typical balsam fir. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain small, winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in boreal and subalpine forests. The species is valued for its ecological role in providing habitat and for its use in reforestation efforts.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies balsamea var. longifolia is primarily native to the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It is found in regions such as New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of Quebec. This variety thrives in cool, moist climates and is commonly found in mountainous and boreal forest ecosystems. It is adapted to acidic soils and often grows in association with other coniferous trees. The plant is an important component of the forest understory in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies balsamea var. longifolia was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool climates, typically in higher elevation regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is commonly found in forested landscapes. This variety is known for its pyramidal shape and aromatic foliage, making it a popular ornamental plant. It has been introduced to various parts of North America, including the northeastern and northwestern United States. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
