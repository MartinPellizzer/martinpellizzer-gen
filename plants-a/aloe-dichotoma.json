    "intro": "Aloe dichotoma, commonly known as the quiver tree, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive branching stem that resembles a tree, with thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are pale green and covered in a layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its branches, typically during the rainy season. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
