These plants are typically characterized by their slender, grass-like appearance and are native to various regions in Africa and Asia. Asthenochloa species often grow in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. They have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, spike-like inflorescences. The genus is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential uses in horticulture or conservation."
