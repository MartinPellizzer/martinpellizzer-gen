It is a terrestrial herb with a compact, upright growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green. The plant features a pseudobulb that supports its growth and stores water, enabling it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically arranged in a loose spike and bloom during the autumn season."
