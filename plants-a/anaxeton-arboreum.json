It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Anaxeton arboreum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
