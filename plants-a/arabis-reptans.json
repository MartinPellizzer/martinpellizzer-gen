It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems spread horizontally along the ground. Arabis reptans is often used in rock gardens due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
