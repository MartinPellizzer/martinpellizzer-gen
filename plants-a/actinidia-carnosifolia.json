    "intro": "Actinidia carnosifolia, commonly known as the hairy actinidia, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically hairy on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and culinary purposes.",
