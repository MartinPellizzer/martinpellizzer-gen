    "intro": "Agropyron transnominatum, commonly known as the Transnistrian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed sites. Agropyron transnominatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
