    "intro": "Actaeogeton, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Actaeogeton campestris, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a tall, slender flowering stem that bears small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a somewhat hairy texture. Actaeogeton is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it has been used historically in traditional medicine."
