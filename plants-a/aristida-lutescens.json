    "intro": "Aristida lutescens, commonly known as the yellow hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its delicate, wiry inflorescences that turn yellow as they mature. The plant typically grows in open, dry habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color when fresh. Aristida lutescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small insects."
