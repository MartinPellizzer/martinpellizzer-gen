    "intro": "Aspidium rostratum, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has large, broad, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, lance-shaped pinnae. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. Aspidium rostratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for use in aquatic or bog gardens."
