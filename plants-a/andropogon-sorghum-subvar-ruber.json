    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subvar. ruber, commonly known as red sorghum, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its striking red pigmentation in its stems and leaves. This plant is native to Africa and thrives in warm, arid climates, making it well-suited for cultivation in semi-arid regions. Its botanical features include tall, robust stalks that can reach up to 3 meters in height, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Red sorghum is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
