    "intro": "Axolus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Mexico. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by triangular, boat-shaped seeds. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
