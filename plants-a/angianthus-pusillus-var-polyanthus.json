    "intro": "Angianthus pusillus var. polyanthus, commonly known as the miniature angel's trumpet, is a compact variant of the angel's trumpet plant. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet, making it suitable for container gardening or as a potted plant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its botanical features include hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are opposite in arrangement."
