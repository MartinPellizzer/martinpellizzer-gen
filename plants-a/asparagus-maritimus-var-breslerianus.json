    "intro": "Asparagus maritimus var. breslerianus, commonly known as the Bresler's asparagus, is a coastal plant adapted to sandy and saline environments. It is characterized by its slender, spiny stems and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. This variety is notable for its resilience to harsh maritime conditions."
