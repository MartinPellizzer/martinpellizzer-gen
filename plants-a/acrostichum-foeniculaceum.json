It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or brown in color. It is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its fibrous stalks have been historically used for thatching and basket weaving.",
