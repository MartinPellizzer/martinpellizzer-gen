    "intro": "Astragalus grandis, commonly known as the large milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
