    "intro": "Arbutus laurifolia, commonly known as the Florida sweetshrub, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and elliptical, providing dense foliage throughout the year. Arbutus laurifolia is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding and is often used in wetland restoration projects."
