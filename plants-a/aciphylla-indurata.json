    "intro": "Aciphylla indurata, commonly known as the hard-leaved spinifex, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth. The plant has tough, fibrous leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Aciphylla indurata is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal and inland regions.",
