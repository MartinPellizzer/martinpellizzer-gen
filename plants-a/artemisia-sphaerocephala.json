    "intro": "Artemisia sphaerocephala, commonly known as the globe artemisia, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Additionally, it has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its aromatic and antiseptic properties."
