    "intro": "Aniba pilosa, commonly known as the silky leaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage with a soft, silky texture on the underside of the leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and antiseptic properties. Aniba pilosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
