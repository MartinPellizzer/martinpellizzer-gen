    "intro": "Andropogon tener, commonly known as slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late summer, which are arranged in spikelets. Andropogon tener is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
