    "intro": "Arquita ancashiana, commonly known as the Cashan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Peruvian Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or forested areas. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its mountainous habitat. Arquita ancashiana is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its cultural significance among local communities."
