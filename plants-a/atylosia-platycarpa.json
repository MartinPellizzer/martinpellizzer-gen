    "intro": "Atylosia platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited atylosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spherical, fruit-like structures called cypsela, which are typically covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a grayish or blue-gray coloration due to a dense covering of trichomes. Atylosia platycarpa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
