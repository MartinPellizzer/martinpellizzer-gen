    "intro": "Archboldiodendron calosericeum subsp. kaindiensis, commonly known as the Kaindiensis archboldiodendron, is a rare shrub endemic to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its native habitat. Due to its restricted range and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
