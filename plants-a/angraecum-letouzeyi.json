    "intro": "Angraecum letouzeyi, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a unique orchid species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a dark center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong fragrance. Angraecum letouzeyi is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
