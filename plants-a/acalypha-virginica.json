    "intro": "Acalypha virginica, commonly known as the smoothleaf or redroot beggarlice, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and a reddish hue on the underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Acalypha virginica is often found in wetlands and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils.",

It is commonly found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. This species thrives in the southeastern and midwestern United States. It is often found growing in dense thickets and along the edges of wetlands. Its native range spans a wide geographic area across the eastern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha virginica was mainly introduced to Italy and Madeira. It is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. The introduction to these regions likely occurred through horticultural or ornamental purposes. It has adapted well to the local climates in both areas. This distribution highlights its potential as an invasive species in non-native habitats."
