    "intro": "Astragalus avajensis, commonly known as the Avar Desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its roots are known to form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which enhance soil fertility. Astragalus avajensis plays a role in stabilizing desert ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to harsh environments."
