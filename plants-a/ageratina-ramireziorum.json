    "intro": "Ageratina ramireziorum, commonly known as Ramirez's blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, blue to purple florets arranged in dense, spherical clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
