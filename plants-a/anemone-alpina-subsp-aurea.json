It features showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and its stem is usually unbranched with few leaves along its length. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundras. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
