    "intro": "Anthurium iltisii, commonly known as the Iltis's flamingo flower, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, often surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium iltisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
