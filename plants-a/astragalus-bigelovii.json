It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to cream-colored flowers in late spring. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus bigelovii is part of the legume family (Fabaceae) and has the ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
