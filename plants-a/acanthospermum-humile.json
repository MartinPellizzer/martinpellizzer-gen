    "intro": "Acanthospermum humile, commonly known as the small pricklyseed, is a low-growing annual herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features small, narrow leaves and produces tiny, spiny fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to arid and semi-arid environments.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal dunes. The species is well adapted to the warm, humid climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthospermum humile was mainly introduced to Alabama, Florida, New York, and South Carolina. It is a species that has become established in these regions, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities. Due to its adaptability, it has spread relatively quickly in these areas."
