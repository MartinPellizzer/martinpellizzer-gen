    "intro": "Aldama ovatifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aldama, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. Aldama ovatifolia is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
