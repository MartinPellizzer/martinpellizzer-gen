    "intro": "Arum syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It features a distinctive underground tuber and tall, arrow-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. It blooms in late spring to early summer, with flowers that are primarily pollinated by insects. The plant is adapted to temperate climates and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
