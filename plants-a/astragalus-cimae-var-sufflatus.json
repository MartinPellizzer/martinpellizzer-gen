    "intro": "Astragalus cimae var. sufflatus, commonly known as the inflated milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its unique feature is the inflated, pod-like fruit that gives it its common name, which plays a role in seed dispersal. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and role in stabilizing sandy soils."
