It features slender, wiry stems that often curl at the tips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
