    "intro": "Anerincleistus ashtonii, commonly known as the Ashton's antheric, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which features a distinctive, elongated calyx that encloses the reproductive organs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats and exhibits a short growing season, making it highly sensitive to environmental changes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
