    "intro": "Astragalus eriolobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus eriolobus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
