It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water. Its leaves are typically round or oval with a waxy surface to repel water. Amphonia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
