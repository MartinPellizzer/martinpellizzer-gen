    "intro": "Acacia morondavensis, commonly known as the Madagascar wattle, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, a common adaptation in arid environments. It produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, and its seeds are enclosed in woody pods. Acacia morondavensis is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems.",

This plant thrives in dry, arid environments and is commonly found in scrublands and dry forests. It is an important component of the local ecosystem and is adapted to the region's unique climate. Its distribution is limited to specific areas due to its ecological requirements and environmental conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia morondavensis was mainly introduced to Madagascar. It is native to the eastern part of the island and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. This plant has been introduced to other regions for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. However, its spread outside its native range has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. It is often found in degraded landscapes and has adapted well to various environmental conditions."
