    "intro": "Andropogon subglabrescens, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon subglabrescens is an important component of native grasslands and plays a role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
