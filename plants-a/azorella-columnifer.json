    "intro": "Azorella columnifer, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to the Andes Mountains of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions made up of tightly packed, woody stems and leaves. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and appear in clusters during the short growing season. Azorella columnifer is well adapted to extreme conditions, with a deep root system and the ability to survive long periods of drought."
