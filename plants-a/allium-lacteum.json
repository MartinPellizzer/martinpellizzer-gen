    "intro": "Allium lacteum, commonly known as the milk garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a cluster of small, white, bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves, with a pungent, garlic-like odor. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels. It is often cultivated for its culinary uses, though it is less common than other allium species. The plant contains sulfur compounds that contribute to its distinctive flavor and potential medicinal properties."
