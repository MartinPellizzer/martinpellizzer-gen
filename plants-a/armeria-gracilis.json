    "intro": "Armeria gracilis, commonly known as slender sea thrift, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to salty, windy environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky coastal areas. Armeria gracilis is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
