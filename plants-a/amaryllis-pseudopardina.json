It features tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white. The leaves are broad and strap-like, emerging from the base of the plant and often forming a rosette. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a valuable addition to gardens in cooler climates. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal care once established."
