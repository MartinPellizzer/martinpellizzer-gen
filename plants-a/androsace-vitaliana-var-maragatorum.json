    "intro": "Androsace vitaliana var. maragatorum, commonly known as the Maragatorum Rock Cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically forms dense mats of foliage, with leaves that are usually rosette-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
