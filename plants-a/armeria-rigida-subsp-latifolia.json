    "intro": "Armeria rigida subsp. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of bright pink or red flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and long flowering period make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
