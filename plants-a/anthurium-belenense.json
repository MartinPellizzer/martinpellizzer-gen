    "intro": "Anthurium belenense, commonly known as the Belenense Arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that house the actual flowers, often in shades of red or orange. Anthurium belenense thrives in warm, moist environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
