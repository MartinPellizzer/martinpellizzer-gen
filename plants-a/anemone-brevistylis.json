    "intro": "Anemone brevistylis, commonly known as the short-styled anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, narrow corona. The plant has palmate, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It blooms in late spring to early summer, and its short pedicels give it its common name. Anemone brevistylis is valued in native plant gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
