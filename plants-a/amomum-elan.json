It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by distinctive three-lobed berries. Its aromatic rhizomes are highly valued for their culinary and medicinal properties, often used in traditional medicine for their digestive and anti-inflammatory effects.
