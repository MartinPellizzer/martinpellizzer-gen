    "intro": "Aristida jorullensis, commonly known as the Jorull\u00e9n grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States, particularly Texas and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in native plant gardens."
