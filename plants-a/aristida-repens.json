    "intro": "Aristida repens, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as meadows and prairies. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
