    "intro": "Argemone intermedia var. stenopetala, commonly known as the narrow-petaled argemone, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with narrow, elongated petals. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiny capsule, which aids in seed dispersal by animals."
