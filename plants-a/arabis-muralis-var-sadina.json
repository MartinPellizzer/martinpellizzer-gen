    "intro": "Arabis muralis var. sadina, commonly known as the Sadina rockcress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate flowers and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
