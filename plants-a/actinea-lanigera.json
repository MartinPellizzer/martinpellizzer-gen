    "intro": "Actinea lanigera, commonly known as the woolly actinia, is a species of sea anemone found in the coastal waters of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy body covered in a dense layer of fine, soft spines that give it a woolly appearance. The polyps of Actinea lanigera are typically pale pink to orange in color and are arranged in a single row along the central axis of the organism. This species thrives in shallow, rocky intertidal zones where it attaches itself to substrates using its pedal disc. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in the ecosystem as both a prey item and a host for various marine organisms.",
