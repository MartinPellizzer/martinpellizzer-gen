    "intro": "Antennaria formosa, commonly known as the fairy cup or pink fairy cup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are clustered in dense, cup-like inflorescences, which give it its common name. Antennaria formosa is adapted to rocky and open habitats, often found in alpine and subalpine regions."
