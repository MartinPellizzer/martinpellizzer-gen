    "intro": "Aster bracei, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant produces showy, violet-blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid environment. Aster bracei is valued for its ecological role and is often found in alpine meadows and forested slopes."
