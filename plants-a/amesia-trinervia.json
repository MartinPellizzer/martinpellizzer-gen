    "intro": "Amesia trinervia, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Amesia trinervia is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and slopes."
