    "intro": "Amethystanthus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf amethyst flower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native habitat."
