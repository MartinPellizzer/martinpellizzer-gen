    "intro": "Acrostichum succisifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hakea, is a species of fern native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a prominent indusium. Acrostichum succisifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity.",
