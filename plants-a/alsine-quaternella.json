    "intro": "Alsine quaternella, commonly known as four-leaf alsike, is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, though it occasionally produces four-leaf variants. The plant has small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, and it produces small, lens-shaped seeds. Alsine quaternella is typically found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
