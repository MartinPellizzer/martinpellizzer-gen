It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, often silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in composite inflorescences. Artemisia rehan contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its medicinal and pesticidal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas."
