    "intro": "Anaxagorea brachycarpa var. obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are elliptical to obovate in shape, often with a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, followed by woody, spherical fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its hard, durable wood, it has been historically used for construction and furniture-making."
