    "intro": "Aspalathus pedicellata, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are typically harvested and processed to produce a popular herbal tea. Aspalathus pedicellata thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region."
