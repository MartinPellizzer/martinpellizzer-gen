    "intro": "Astragalus bigelovii var. thompsoniae, commonly known as Thompson's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or white pea-like flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Thompson's milkvetch plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
