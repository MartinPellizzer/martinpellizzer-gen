It is commonly found in the coastal plain regions of these states. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Abelia hersii is also found in parts of Alabama and South Carolina. It is well adapted to the humid climate and is often seen in natural habitats throughout the southeastern U.S.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia hersii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida and Georgia. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or garden settings. This plant is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and showy flowers that bloom in the summer. It has been introduced to various regions beyond its native range for ornamental purposes. However, it is considered non-invasive in most areas where it is planted."
