    "intro": "Asplenium vestitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium vestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
