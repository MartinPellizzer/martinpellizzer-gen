    "intro": "Argophyllum nitidum var. cryptophleba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf argophyllum, is a perennial shrub native to the wet tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and estuarine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
