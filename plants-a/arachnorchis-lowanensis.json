    "intro": "Arachnorchis lowanensis, commonly known as the Lowan spider-orchid, is an endemic orchid species native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender sepals and petals that resemble the legs of a spider. The plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. It produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the cooler months of spring and autumn. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
