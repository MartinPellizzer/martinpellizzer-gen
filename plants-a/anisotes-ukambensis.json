    "intro": "Anisotes ukambensis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant in the sediment. Anisotes ukambensis plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
