    "intro": "Antennaria glabrata f. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose mouse-ear cress, is a holarctic flowering plant belonging to the family Capparaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, rounded leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect stalks. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, and is often found in temperate regions. Its distinctive fuzzy appearance and compact growth make it easily identifiable in its natural environment."
