It features upright, branching stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy upper surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded woodland environments.",
