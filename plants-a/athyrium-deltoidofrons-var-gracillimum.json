    "intro": "Athyrium deltoidofrons var. gracillimum, commonly known as the slender-leafed maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to eastern Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
