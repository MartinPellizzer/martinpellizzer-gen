    "intro": "Arctium pulchellum, commonly known as the beggar's ticks, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by burrs that cling to clothing and fur. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Arctium pulchellum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows."
