    "intro": "Aechmea triangularis, commonly known as the triangular bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy surface and often exhibit a distinctive triangular shape, giving the plant its common name. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. This plant thrives in humid, indirect light conditions and is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
