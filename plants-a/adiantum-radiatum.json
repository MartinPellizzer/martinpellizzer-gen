    "intro": "Adiantum radiatum, commonly known as the royal fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Adiantum radiatum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
