    "intro": "Arthrophyllum daenikeri, commonly known as the mountain rock orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, fragrant flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in mountainous regions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
