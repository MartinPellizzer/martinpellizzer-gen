    "intro": "Antrophyum vittarioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or vittarioid fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces primarily through spore dispersal. Antrophyum vittarioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
