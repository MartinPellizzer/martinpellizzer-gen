    "intro": "Acmena pendula, commonly known as the weeping satinash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive pendulous growth habit, with long, drooping branches that create a cascading appearance. The leaves are simple, alternate, and lance-shaped, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its unique form and seasonal color changes.",
