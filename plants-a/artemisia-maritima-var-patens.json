    "intro": "Artemisia maritima var. patens, commonly known as sea wormwood, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. It has a strong, camphor-like scent and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind. This variety is closely related to other artemisia species and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal habitats."
