    "intro": "Asplenium affine var. affine, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a leathery texture. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium. Asplenium affine var. affine is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
