    "intro": "Acalypha diversifolia var. genuina, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its growth habit is typically upright, with branching that can be either shrub-like or tree-like depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to semi-shaded environments in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha diversifolia var. genuina is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland environments and is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. This variant is particularly adapted to moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. It is often seen in secondary growth areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental foliage. The plant plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha diversifolia var. genuina was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was brought there during the late 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited for the Hawaiian environment. It has since become naturalized in several areas, particularly in moist, shaded locations. However, it is not considered invasive and is primarily found in cultivated gardens and along stream banks."
