It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color and arranged in clusters. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late winter or early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, smooth seeds when mature. Arctostaphylos crassifolia is well adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub ecosystems."
