    "intro": "Aristaria, commonly known as the false arum, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, often colorful inflorescences, which consist of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aristaria species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. They have rhizomatous growth habits, allowing them to spread and form dense colonies. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
