It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of spikelets that contain small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in well-drained soils. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a culm that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
