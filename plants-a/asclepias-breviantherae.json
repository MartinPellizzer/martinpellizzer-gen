    "intro": "Asclepias breviantherae, commonly known as the short-throated milkweed, is a species of flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered flowers with a unique structure that includes a crown of short, hooked hairs. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardenolides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias breviantherae typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a host plant for monarch caterpillars and its contribution to local biodiversity."
