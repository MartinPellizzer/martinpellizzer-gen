    "intro": "Albizia marginata, commonly known as the silky albizia, is a deciduous tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its bark is smooth and light brown, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. Albizia marginata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
