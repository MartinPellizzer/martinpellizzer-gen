    "intro": "Adipe stefanae, commonly known as the Stefanae's Fat Plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its arid and rocky habitat. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Adipe stefanae is considered a vulnerable species.",
