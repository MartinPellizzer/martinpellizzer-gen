    "intro": "Aquilaria rugosa, commonly known as the Malayan agarwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Thymelaeaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic resinous heartwood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and elliptical, while its flowers are small and yellowish-green. The tree's unique ability to produce a fragrant resin, known as agar, makes it a significant species in both ecological and economic contexts."
