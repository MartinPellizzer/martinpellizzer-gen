    "intro": "Alkanna tinctoria subsp. glandulosa, commonly known as the sticky alkanna, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots contain a red-orange resin that has been historically used for dyeing textiles and as a natural pigment. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
