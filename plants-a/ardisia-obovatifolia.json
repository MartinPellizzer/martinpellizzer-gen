    "intro": "Ardisia obovatifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed ardisia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, ovate to broadly ovate leaves that are typically dark green and arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
