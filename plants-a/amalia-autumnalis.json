    "intro": "Amalia autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the fall, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a tall, sturdy stem that can reach up to 3 feet in height, adorned with broad, strap-like leaves. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. Amalia autumnalis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to add color to gardens during the cooler months."
