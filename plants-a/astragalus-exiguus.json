    "intro": "Astragalus exiguus, commonly known as the small milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender stems, small compound leaves, and clusters of yellow to reddish-purple flowers. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Astragalus exiguus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
