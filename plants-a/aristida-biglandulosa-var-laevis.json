    "intro": "Aristida biglandulosa var. laevis, commonly known as silky dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikelets that are often tinged with red or brown, adding visual interest to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its delicate appearance and ability to form dense clumps make it a desirable ornamental plant in native gardens."
