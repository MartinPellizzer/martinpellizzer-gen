    "intro": "Aster modestus, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of blue and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, Aster modestus is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
