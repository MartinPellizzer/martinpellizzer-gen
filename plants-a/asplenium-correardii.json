    "intro": "Asplenium correardii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in humid, moist conditions. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming a dense, low-growing mat. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Asplenium correardii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to tolerate low light conditions."
