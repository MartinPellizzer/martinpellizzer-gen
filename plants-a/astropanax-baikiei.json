    "intro": "Astropanax baikiei, commonly known as the Korean ginseng, is a perennial herb native to the Korean Peninsula and northeastern China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, pinnately compound leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties, with roots containing bioactive compounds similar to those found in Panax ginseng. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its therapeutic benefits. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its native habitat."
