    "intro": "Aloe candelabrum, commonly known as the candleplant, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a branched stem with fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in a spike-like formation. Aloe candelabrum is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive dry conditions. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
