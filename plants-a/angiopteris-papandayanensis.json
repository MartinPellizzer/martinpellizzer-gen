    "intro": "Angiopteris papandayanensis, commonly known as the Papandayan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Indonesia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Angiopteris papandayanensis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygenation for small aquatic organisms."
