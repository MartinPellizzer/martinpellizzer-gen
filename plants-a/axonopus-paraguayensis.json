    "intro": "Axonopus paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay grass, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riparian zones. It has fibrous roots and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Axonopus paraguayensis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
