    "intro": "Artemisia pycnostachya, commonly known as silver dust sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive, almost powdered appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for arid or semi-arid landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and drought tolerance make it a popular plant in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
