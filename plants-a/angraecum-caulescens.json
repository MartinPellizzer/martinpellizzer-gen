    "intro": "Angraecum caulescens, commonly known as the slender angraecum, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It features a slender, upright stem that often bears a single, showy inflorescence with pendulous flowers. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive, spurred lip that attracts nectar-feeding moths. Angraecum caulescens is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and requires well-drained soil and minimal water."
