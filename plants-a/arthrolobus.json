    "intro": "Arthrolobus, commonly known as the creeping broomrape, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients, typically attaching to the roots of grasses and other herbaceous plants. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often overlooked due to its inconspicuous appearance. Its life cycle is closely tied to its host, and it can cause significant damage to agricultural crops. Arthrolobus is found in various regions across Europe, Asia, and North Africa, thriving in disturbed soils and open habitats."
