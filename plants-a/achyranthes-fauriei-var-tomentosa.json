    "intro": "Achyranthes fauriei var. tomentosa, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and often have a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. This variant is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and tonic properties.",
