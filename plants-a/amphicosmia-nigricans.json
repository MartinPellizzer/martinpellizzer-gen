    "intro": "Amphicosmia nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its dark, wiry stems and lance-shaped, compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests or rocky crevices, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the spores are released during the late spring or early summer. The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
