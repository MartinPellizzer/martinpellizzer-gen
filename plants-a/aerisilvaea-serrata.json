    "intro": "Aerisilvaea serrata, commonly known as the serrated forest fern, is a species characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are distinctly serrated along the edges. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forest understories where it thrives in partial to full shade. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Its leaves are bioluminescent at night, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity."
