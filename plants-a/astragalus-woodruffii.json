It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus woodruffii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native range."
