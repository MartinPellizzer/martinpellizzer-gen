    "intro": "Arenaria peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Andes mountains of Peru. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer seasons. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Arenaria peruviana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
