    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus f. japonicus, commonly known as the Japanese hairy grass, is a variant of the hairy grass species native to East Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown florets. This grass is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
