    "intro": "Angostura odoratissima, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas of the Americas. It belongs to the family Acoraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, sword-like leaves and small, white flowers. The plant is known for its strong, spicy scent, which is derived from volatile compounds in its rhizomes. It thrives in marshy or aquatic environments and is often found in slow-moving water bodies. The rhizomes of Angostura odoratissima have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
