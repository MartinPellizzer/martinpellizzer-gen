    "intro": "Alnus incana var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the glaucophylla mountain alder, is a variant of the mountain alder found primarily in the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in mountainous regions. The leaves are lanceolate, with a distinctive bluish-green underside that gives the plant its common name. It produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
