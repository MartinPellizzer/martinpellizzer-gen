    "intro": "Allium geyeri f. tenerum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic chive, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, umbel-shaped clusters of white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that are edible and resemble garlic cloves, though they are milder in flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to form dense mats over time."
