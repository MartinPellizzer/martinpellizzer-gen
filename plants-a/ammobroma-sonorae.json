    "intro": "Ammobroma sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran ammobroma, is a flowering plant native to the Sonoran Desert region of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small and grayish-green, covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ammobroma sonorae plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
