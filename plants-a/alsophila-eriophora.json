    "intro": "Alsophila eriophora, commonly known as the narrow-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species in its natural habitat. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while the roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Alsophila eriophora plays an important ecological role in humid, shaded environments, providing habitat for various small organisms."
