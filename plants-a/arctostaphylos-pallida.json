    "intro": "Arctostaphylos pallida, commonly known as the whiteleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically gray-green to white in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters, usually pink to reddish in hue, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Arctostaphylos pallida is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, and it plays an important role in its native ecosystems."
