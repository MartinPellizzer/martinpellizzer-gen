    "intro": "Athyrium unifurcatum var. subfluviale, commonly known as the river fern, is a variant of the common wood fern. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically light green with a slightly glossy texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread along the forest floor. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
