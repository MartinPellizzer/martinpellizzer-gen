    "intro": "Artemisia punctata, commonly known as bluegreen wormwood, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. The plant has gray-green foliage with a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of essential oils. Its small yellow flowers appear in compact clusters and are typically visited by insects. Artemisia punctata is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural pesticides."
