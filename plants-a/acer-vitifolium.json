    "intro": "Acer vitifolium, commonly known as the grape-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that resemble the shape of grape leaves, with five to seven lobes. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mountainous areas.",
