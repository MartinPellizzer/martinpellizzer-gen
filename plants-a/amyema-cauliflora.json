    "intro": "Amyema cauliflora, commonly known as the cauliflower orchid, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, where flowers develop directly on the stem rather than at the ends of branches. The plant produces large, showy, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters, resembling cauliflower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture. Amyema cauliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
