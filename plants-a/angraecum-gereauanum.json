    "intro": "Angraecum gereauanum, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence bearing numerous white, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive yellow lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates to prevent root rot. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by the giant hawkmoth, which has a long proboscis adapted to reach the nectar at the base of the flower. Angraecum gereauanum is highly valued in horticulture for its beauty and rarity, making it a sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
