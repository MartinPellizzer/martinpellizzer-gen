    "intro": "Anthurium campii, commonly known as the Camp's arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that can range in color from deep green to variegated patterns. The plant produces striking spadices, which are the modified leaves that enclose the small, inconspicuous flowers. Anthurium campii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
