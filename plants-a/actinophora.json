    "intro": "Actinophora, commonly known as the rock cress, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are typically small, herbaceous species that thrive in rocky or arid environments. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, four-petaled flowers. Actinophora species often have a short life cycle and are adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Their seeds are usually small and dispersed by wind, contributing to their ability to colonize new areas."
