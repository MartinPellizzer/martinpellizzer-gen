    "intro": "Ananas acostae, commonly known as the Acosta pineapple, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of sword-shaped leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces a spiky, red or orange fruit that resembles a pineapple but is smaller and less commonly cultivated. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention in its arid habitat. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
