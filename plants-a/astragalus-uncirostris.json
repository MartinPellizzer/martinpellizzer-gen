    "intro": "Astragalus uncirostris, commonly known as the bear paw milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain several tiny, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found at high elevations. Astragalus uncirostris is a member of the legume family and has adapted to nutrient-poor soils through its nitrogen-fixing abilities."
