    "intro": "Angiopteris boivinii, commonly known as the Boivin's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant has a complex life cycle involving both aquatic and terrestrial phases. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize water ecosystems. Angiopteris boivinii plays a vital role in aquatic habitats by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
