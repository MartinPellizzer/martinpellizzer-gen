    "intro": "Arachniodes obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leafed nettle fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, almost spider-like appearance, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in shady, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
