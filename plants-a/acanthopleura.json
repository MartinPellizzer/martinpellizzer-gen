    "intro": "Acanthopleura, commonly known as the sea lily, is a type of echinoderm that belongs to the class Crinoidea. It is characterized by its unique structure, featuring a central calyx surrounded by arms that are used for filter feeding. The plant has a sessile lifestyle, attaching itself to the ocean floor with a stalk-like stem. Its body is covered in small, calcareous plates that provide structural support and protection. Acanthopleura plays an important ecological role in marine environments by contributing to biodiversity and serving as a habitat for smaller organisms."
