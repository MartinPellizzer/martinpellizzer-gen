    "intro": "Andropogon garipensis, commonly known as the Mexican bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon garipensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in stabilizing soils in native plant landscapes."
