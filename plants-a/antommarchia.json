    "intro": "Antommarchia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America and are characterized by their large, showy white flowers that open at night. The flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Antommarchia species typically have smooth, waxy leaves and produce small, fleshy berries that contain the seeds. The genus is notable for its unique adaptation to nighttime blooming, which is a key feature of its botanical significance."
