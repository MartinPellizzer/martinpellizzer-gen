    "intro": "Artanthe acutifolia f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf artanthe, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, compact rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants."
