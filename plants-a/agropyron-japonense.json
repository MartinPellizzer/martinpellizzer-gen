    "intro": "Agropyron japonense, commonly known as Japanese wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to East Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control."
