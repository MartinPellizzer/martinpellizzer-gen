    "intro": "Agropyron dentatum var. elatum, commonly known as tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically clustered at the ends of its stems, with each spikelet containing several small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed sites. Tall wheatgrass is valued for its ecological benefits, including erosion control and as a forage crop for livestock."
