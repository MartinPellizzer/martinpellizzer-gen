    "intro": "Aa schickendantzii, commonly known as the Schickendantzii orchid, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flower spikes that can reach up to 3 meters in height, making it one of the tallest orchids in the world. The plant produces numerous small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom sequentially along the spike. It thrives in cool, moist environments with high humidity and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often found in protected areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aa schickendantzii is primarily native to Argentina Northwest. This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of this area. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils typical of the region's landscape. The distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the northwest of Argentina. It is a rare and endemic species in this part of the country.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa schickendantzii was mainly introduced to areas with specific soil and climate conditions that mimic its native habitat. It is typically found in regions with well-drained, sandy soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. The plant has been introduced to several locations outside its native range for ornamental or ecological purposes. However, its spread has been limited due to its specific environmental requirements. Despite this, there are concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems if it establishes itself in new areas."
