    "intro": "Allosorus villosus, commonly known as the hairy allosorus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Allosorus villosus thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value."
