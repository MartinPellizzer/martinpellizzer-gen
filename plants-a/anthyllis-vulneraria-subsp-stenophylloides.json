    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. stenophylloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woundwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as limestone soils and open woodlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a glandular surface, which contributes to its common name. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enhancing soil fertility in its native environment."
