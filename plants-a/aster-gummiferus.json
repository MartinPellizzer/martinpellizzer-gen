    "intro": "Aster gummiferus, commonly known as the gumweed aster, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces a sticky, resinous substance from its leaves and stems, which gives it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Aster gummiferus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
