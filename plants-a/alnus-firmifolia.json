    "intro": "Alnus firmifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf alder, is a deciduous tree native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broad and ovate, often with a slightly serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Alnus firmifolia typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and mixed forests."
