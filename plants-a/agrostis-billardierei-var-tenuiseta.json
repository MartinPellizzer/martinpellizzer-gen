    "intro": "Agrostis billardierei var. tenuiseta, commonly known as slender hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to southern Australia. It typically forms dense, mat-like clumps with fine, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or sandy environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
