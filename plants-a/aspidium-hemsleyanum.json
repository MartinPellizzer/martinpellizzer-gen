    "intro": "Aspidium hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Hemsley's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium hemsleyanum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
