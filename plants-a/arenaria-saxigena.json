It typically forms dense mats of tiny, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny conditions. Its botanical features make it a hardy and resilient species found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia."
