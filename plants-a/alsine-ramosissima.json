    "intro": "Alsine ramosissima, commonly known as prairie sandwort, is a low-growing annual plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its branched stems and small, white or pink flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in prairie and disturbed habitats. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
