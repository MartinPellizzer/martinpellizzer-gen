    "intro": "Asplenium praemorsum f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine shield fern, is a rare and specialized fern species adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, leathery fronds that are typically dark green with a rough texture. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded conditions, often found in mountainous regions across the northern hemisphere. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
