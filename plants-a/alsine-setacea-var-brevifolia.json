    "intro": "Alsine setacea var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. Its seed capsules are dry and dehiscent, releasing fine seeds that are well adapted for wind dispersal. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh environmental conditions."
