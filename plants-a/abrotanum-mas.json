    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum mas is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky, and coastal areas, often found in sunny and well-drained soils. This plant is commonly associated with Mediterranean scrublands and maquis vegetation. It has adapted to the harsh climate of the region with its drought-resistant properties. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean basin.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum mas was mainly introduced to control invasive plant species through biological control programs. It is commonly used in agricultural settings to manage weeds in crops such as cotton and soybeans. The plant is native to South America but has been introduced to several regions in the United States and parts of Europe. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in pastures. Due to its rapid growth and competitive nature, it can become invasive in non-native environments if not properly managed."
