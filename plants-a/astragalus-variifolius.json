    "intro": "Astragalus variifolius, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which vary in shape and size across the plant, contributing to its common name. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus variifolius plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
