    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. glaucus, commonly known as the blue meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and leaves that are typically blue-green in color due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
