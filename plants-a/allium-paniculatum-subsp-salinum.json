    "intro": "Allium paniculatum subsp. salinum, commonly known as salt marsh garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the western United States. It typically grows in saline or brackish wetlands, adapting to high salt concentrations in its environment. The plant features grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale purple flowers in a loose, branching inflorescence. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other Allium species. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local wildlife."
