    "intro": "Acer truncatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a serrated edge. The tree produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer truncatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant fall foliage, which displays shades of yellow and red.",
