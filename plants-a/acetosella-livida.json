    "intro": "Acetosella livida, commonly known as silvery mountain sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
