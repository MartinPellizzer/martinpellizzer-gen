    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. albifolius, commonly known as the whiteleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Astragalus. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in arid conditions."
