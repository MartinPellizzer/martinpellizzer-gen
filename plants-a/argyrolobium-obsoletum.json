    "intro": "Argyrolobium obsoletum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed burr medic, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
