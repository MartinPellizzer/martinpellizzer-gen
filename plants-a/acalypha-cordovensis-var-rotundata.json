This plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is commonly found in lowland tropical forests. It is often associated with secondary growth areas and disturbed habitats due to its adaptability. The species is also present in some Caribbean islands, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. Its native range is characterized by high rainfall and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cordovensis var. rotundata was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Australia, the United States, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
