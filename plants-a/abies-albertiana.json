    "intro": "Abies albertiana, commonly known as the Albert's fir, is a species of evergreen conifer native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is typically thin and scaly, becoming thicker and more furrowed with age. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in subalpine or alpine forests.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies albertiana is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, specifically in the western United States and southern British Columbia. It is commonly found in the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, and the northern Rocky Mountains. This species thrives in high elevation environments, often growing at elevations between 2,000 and 7,000 feet. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies albertiana was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in regions such as the western United States, particularly in states like California, Oregon, and Washington. This species thrives in high elevation environments where temperatures are moderate and precipitation is abundant. Its introduction has been largely due to its ornamental value and adaptability to specific ecological niches. However, it is not widely distributed beyond its native range due to its limited tolerance for extreme environmental conditions."
