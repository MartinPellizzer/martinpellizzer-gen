    "intro": "Acacia drepanocarpa, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of southern and western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically green or bluish-green. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting a variety of pollinators. Its seeds are encased in woody pods and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize sandy or rocky coastal soils. Acacia drepanocarpa is well adapted to salty air and wind, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia drepanocarpa is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This shrub or small tree is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drepanocarpa was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and stabilize degraded lands, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used for afforestation and rehabilitation of mined or deforested areas due to its rapid growth and deep root system. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility over time. Its introduction has been widespread in Australia, South Africa, and parts of Asia for environmental restoration projects. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
