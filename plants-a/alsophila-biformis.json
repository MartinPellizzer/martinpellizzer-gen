    "intro": "Alsophila biformis, commonly known as the two-lobed tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The plant belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its fronds are dimorphic, with the lower ones being shorter and the upper ones longer and more delicate. Alsophila biformis plays a role in forest ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stability."
