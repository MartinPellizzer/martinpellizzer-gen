    "intro": "Apluda rugosa, commonly known as the rough apluda, is a perennial grass native to South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough, textured surface that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Apluda rugosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
