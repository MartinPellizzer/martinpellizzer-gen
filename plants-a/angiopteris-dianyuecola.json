    "intro": "Angiopteris dianyuecola, commonly known as the Dianyuecola water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a small, four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including tiny spore-producing organs, are located on the undersides of its leaves. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
