It is a biennial herb native to Europe, typically growing in moist, temperate climates. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in umbel-like clusters. Its hairy fruits are a distinguishing trait, aiding in seed dispersal. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
