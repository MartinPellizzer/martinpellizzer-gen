    "intro": "Austronea acarophylla, commonly known as the coastal acarophyll, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal and inland sandy soils, adapted to withstand high salinity and extreme temperatures. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pink or purple and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
