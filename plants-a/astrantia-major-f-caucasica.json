    "intro": "Astrantia major f. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It features showy, pink to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer, surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant flowers and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
