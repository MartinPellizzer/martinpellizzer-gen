    "intro": "Anisacanthus cauduciflorus, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, candle-like yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody, branching stems and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often with a fuzzy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in dry, rocky soils."
