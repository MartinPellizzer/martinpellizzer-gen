    "intro": "Aeschynanthus perrottetii var. malabaricus, commonly known as the Malabar gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its tubular, brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, featuring velvety, ovate leaves with a prominent midrib. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor cultivation and botanical gardens."
