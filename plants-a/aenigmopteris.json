    "intro": "Aenigmopteris, commonly known as the enigmatic fern, is a genus of fossilized plants belonging to the order Psilotales. These plants are characterized by their unique, simple structure, lacking true roots, stems, and leaves as seen in modern ferns. Aenigmopteris fossils are primarily found in Carboniferous and Permian deposits, indicating they thrived in ancient swampy environments. The genus is notable for its primitive features, offering insights into the early evolution of vascular plants. Due to their rarity and fragmented remains, much about their morphology and ecology remains speculative."
