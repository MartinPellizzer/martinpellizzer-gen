    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens subsp. fulgens, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of velvety, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
