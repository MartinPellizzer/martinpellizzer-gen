    "intro": "Arcytophyllum confertum, commonly known as the denseleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, woody stems and dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Arcytophyllum confertum is valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
