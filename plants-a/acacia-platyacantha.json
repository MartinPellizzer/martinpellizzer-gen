    "intro": "Acacia platyacantha, commonly known as the flat-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces flat, elliptical pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. Acacia platyacantha is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in dry conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia platyacantha is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in rocky soils and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in dry climates and is often part of the vegetation in savanna and woodland ecosystems. It is well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Acacia platyacantha plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various local wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia platyacantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered an environmental weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly invasive in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands make it a significant threat to native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
