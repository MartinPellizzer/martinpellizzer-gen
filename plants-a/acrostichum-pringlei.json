    "intro": "Acrostichum pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's brake, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a unique, fan-like pattern. Acrostichum pringlei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability in its native habitat.",
