    "intro": "Alchemilla diademata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with basal leaves that are silver-white in color, covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their supposed diuretic properties. Alchemilla diademata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
