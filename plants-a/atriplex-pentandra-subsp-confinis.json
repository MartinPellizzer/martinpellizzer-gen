    "intro": "Atriplex pentandra subsp. confinis, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its salt-tolerant nature allows it to thrive in soils with high salinity. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
