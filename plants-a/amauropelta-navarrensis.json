It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are leathery and have a unique, compact structure that helps it retain moisture. Amauropelta navarrensis is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its habitat."
