    "intro": "Agropyron dshungaricum, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and semi-arid regions. Agropyron dshungaricum is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
