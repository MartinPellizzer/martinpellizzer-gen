    "intro": "Astragalus newberryi var. escalantinus, commonly known as Escalante milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and sagebrush habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Its botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology and conservation."
