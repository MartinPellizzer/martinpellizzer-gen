    "intro": "Aspidium orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to high-altitude regions of Mexico and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. Aspidium orizabae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
