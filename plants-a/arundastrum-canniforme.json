It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that resemble candles, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Arundastrum canniforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
