    "intro": "Anisotes zenkeri, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features whorled leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers. Its bright green, lance-shaped leaves are often submerged, while some may extend above the water surface. Anisotes zenkeri is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
