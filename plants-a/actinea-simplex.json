    "intro": "Actinea simplex, commonly known as the common sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. Actinea simplex thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and ecological restoration projects.",
