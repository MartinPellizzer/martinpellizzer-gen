    "intro": "Alchemilla schiedeana, commonly known as the Schiedea alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically basal, clustered at the base, and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Alchemilla schiedeana is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
