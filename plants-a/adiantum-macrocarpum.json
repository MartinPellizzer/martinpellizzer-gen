    "intro": "Adiantum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a strikingly elegant fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters, with a feathery, lacy appearance. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are dark green and often have a bluish tint, with tiny, spore-producing structures called sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Adiantum macrocarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
