    "intro": "Aleisanthia rupestris, commonly known as the rock heather, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Aleisanthia rupestris is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh environments. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine collections."
