    "intro": "Allium splendens subsp. insulare, commonly known as the island garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is characterized by its strong garlic scent and is often grown for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
