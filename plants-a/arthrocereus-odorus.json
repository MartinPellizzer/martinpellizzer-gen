    "intro": "Arthrocereus odorus, commonly known as the fragrant candle cactus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pink, which emit a strong, sweet fragrance, especially at night. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. Arthrocereus odorus is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
