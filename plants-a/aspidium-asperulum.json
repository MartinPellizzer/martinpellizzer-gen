    "intro": "Aspidium asperulum, commonly known as the rough harts-tongue fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium asperulum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its rhizome is creeping and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in temperate climates."
