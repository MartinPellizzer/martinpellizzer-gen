    "intro": "Allium rubellum var. stellatum, commonly known as the star garlic or clustered garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant's bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a useful culinary plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its ornamental value comes from its compact size and attractive floral display."
