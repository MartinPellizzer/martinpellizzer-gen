    "intro": "Aristolochia loefgrenii, commonly known as the Hawaiian birth vine, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a heart or a snake, which is a common feature among members of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, and it grows as a climbing vine with a woody stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests on the islands of Oahu and Maui. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
