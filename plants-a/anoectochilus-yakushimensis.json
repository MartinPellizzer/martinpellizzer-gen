    "intro": "Anoectochilus yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushiman Shiro-ike, is a rare and highly sought-after orchid native to Japan. It is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers with intricate markings. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often found in mountainous regions. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surface of tree trunks or rocks rather than in soil. Due to its rarity and beauty, it is highly valued in both horticultural and conservation contexts."
