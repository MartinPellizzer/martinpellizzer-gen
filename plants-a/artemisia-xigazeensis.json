It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. It contains various volatile oils and has been used traditionally in folk medicine for its purported health benefits. Its resilience to harsh climates makes it an important species in alpine ecosystems."
