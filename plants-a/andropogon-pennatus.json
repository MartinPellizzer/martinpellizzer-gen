    "intro": "Andropogon pennatus, commonly known as the feather grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery plumes that give it a distinctive appearance, especially during the flowering season. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Its slender, upright stems and fine, linear leaves contribute to its ornamental value in gardens. Andropogon pennatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
