    "intro": "Aerangis curnowiana, commonly known as the Curnow's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. It is often found in coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray and dry conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
