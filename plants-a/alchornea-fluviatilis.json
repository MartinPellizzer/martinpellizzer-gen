    "intro": "Alchornea fluviatilis, commonly known as river alchornea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Alchornea fluviatilis is often found in wetland areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of riparian zones."
