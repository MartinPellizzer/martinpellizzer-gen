    "intro": "Asplenium miersii, commonly known as the Miers' spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with dark green, leathery leaves that are deeply divided. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium miersii is a hardy species that thrives in humid conditions and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
