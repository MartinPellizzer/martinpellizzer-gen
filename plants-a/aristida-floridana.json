    "intro": "Aristida floridana, commonly known as Florida threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. While not widely cultivated, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
