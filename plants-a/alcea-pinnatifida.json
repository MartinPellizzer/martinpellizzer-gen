    "intro": "Alcea pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hollyhock, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it typically grows in rocky or dry habitats. The plant is characterized by its tall, spindly stems and showy, rose-like flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. Alcea pinnatifida is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and for its historical use in traditional medicine."
