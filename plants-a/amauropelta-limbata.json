    "intro": "Amauropelta limbata, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Amauropelta limbata is notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
