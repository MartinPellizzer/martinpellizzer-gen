    "intro": "Anemone rupestris subsp. gelida, commonly known as the alpine anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it forms dense clusters of showy, white to pink flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and windy conditions. It blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
