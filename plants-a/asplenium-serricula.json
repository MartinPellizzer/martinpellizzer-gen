    "intro": "Asplenium serricula, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often serrated along the edges, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, particularly in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are short and branched, allowing it to anchor itself to substrates while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Asplenium serricula is a relatively small fern, with leaves usually not exceeding 10 centimeters in length."
