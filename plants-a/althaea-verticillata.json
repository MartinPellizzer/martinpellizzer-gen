    "intro": "Althaea verticillata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright stems and heart-shaped leaves that are arranged in a whorl at the nodes. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. Althaea verticillata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
