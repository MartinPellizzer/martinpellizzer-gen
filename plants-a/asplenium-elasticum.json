    "intro": "Asplenium elasticum, commonly known as the elastic spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that can flex and bend, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing moisture and nutrients. Asplenium elasticum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
