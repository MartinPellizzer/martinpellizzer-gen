    "intro": "Archidendron kanehirae, commonly known as the Japanese flame tree, is a tropical leguminous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fiery orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces pods that contain seeds covered in a fleshy, sticky pulp. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is also used in ecological restoration projects."
