    "intro": "Aulomyrcia ramulosa var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed myrcia, is a shrub native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its elliptic to ovate leaves that are usually narrower than the typical variety, with a subcordate base. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
