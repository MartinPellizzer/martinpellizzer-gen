    "intro": "Acacia notabilis, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat. The golden wattle is also a symbol of Australia and is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
