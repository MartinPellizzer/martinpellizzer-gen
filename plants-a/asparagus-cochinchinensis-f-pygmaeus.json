    "intro": "Asparagus cochinchinensis f. pygmaeus, commonly known as dwarf asparagus, is a compact, ornamental variety of the asparagus plant. It features small, delicate leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This fern-like plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. The plant is also valued for its edible young shoots, which are harvested in the spring."
