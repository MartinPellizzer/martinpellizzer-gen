    "intro": "Aconitum leptophyllum, commonly known as the slender monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a hooded shape, characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens.",
