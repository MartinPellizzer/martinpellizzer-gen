    "intro": "Arnebia orientalis var. tubata, commonly known as the Tibetan gentian, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and neighboring areas. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
