    "intro": "Asclepias macrophylla, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but beneficial to monarch butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Asclepias macrophylla plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitats."
