    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon glumaceum var. typica is primarily native to the western United States, specifically California and Oregon. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon glumaceum var. typica was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal regions. It thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and low to moderate precipitation. This plant is often found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, dunes, and sandy soils. Its introduction has been noted in several coastal states along the western United States. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
