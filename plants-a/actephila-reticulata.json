    "intro": "Actephila reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds with a distinctive network of veins. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to the substrate. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy.",
