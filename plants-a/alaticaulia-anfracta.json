    "intro": "Alaticaulia anfracta, commonly known as the zigzag rockrose, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant's leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Alaticaulia anfracta is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
