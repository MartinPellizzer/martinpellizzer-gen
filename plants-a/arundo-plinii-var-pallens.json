It is characterized by its striking silvery-gray foliage, which contrasts with its tall, reed-like stems. This plant thrives in moist environments and is often found near water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture and a distinctive bluish-green hue. The silver reed is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in landscaping and wetland restoration projects."
