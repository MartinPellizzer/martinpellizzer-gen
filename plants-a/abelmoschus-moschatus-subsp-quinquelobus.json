It thrives in warm climates with well-drained soils and is commonly found in open habitats like grasslands and riverine areas. This subspecies is also present in parts of southern Asia, including India and Sri Lanka, where it has been introduced for its ornamental and medicinal value. It is often cultivated for its large, showy flowers and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The plant's native range reflects its adaptation to diverse ecological conditions across the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus moschatus subsp. quinquelobus was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential agricultural use. It is often cultivated for its unique, lobed leaves and ability to thrive in warm climates. The plant has been spread through both intentional planting and accidental introduction via trade or landscaping activities. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. However, it also provides habitat and food for certain wildlife species."
