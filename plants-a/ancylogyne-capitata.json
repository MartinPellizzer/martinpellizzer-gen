    "intro": "Ancylogyne capitata, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a distinctive rosette of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, globular inflorescence at the center of the rosette. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, adapting to harsh, dry environments. Ancylogyne capitata is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of local flora in its native habitat."
