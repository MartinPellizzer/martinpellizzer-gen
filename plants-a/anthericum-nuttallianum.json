    "intro": "Anthericum nuttallianum, commonly known as Nuttall's lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its strap-like, grass-like leaves and showy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The flowers bloom in early summer and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies."
