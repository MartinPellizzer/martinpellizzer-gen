    "intro": "Abronia micrantha var. pedunculata, commonly known as the coastal bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California. It is a low-growing herb with prostrate stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and provides nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a species of concern in some areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia micrantha var. pedunculata is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It thrives in well-drained, sandy habitats and is often associated with maritime environments. The species is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia micrantha var. pedunculata was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the southeastern United States. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments typical of beachfront areas. This plant is often found in regions with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Its introduction has been associated with habitat fragmentation and human activity along coastal regions. However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas and may compete with native flora."
