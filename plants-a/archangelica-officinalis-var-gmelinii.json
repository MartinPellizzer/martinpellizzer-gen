    "intro": "Archangelica officinalis var. gmelinii, commonly known as the Siberian angelica, is a perennial herb native to the colder regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces tall, branched stems with small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their aromatic and medicinal properties. This variety is closely related to the common angelica but is distinguished by its hardier nature and unique habitat preferences."
