    "intro": "Androsace lactiflora, commonly known as the milky rock jasmine, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a dense mat of hairy, evergreen leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky landscapes. Its succulent-like leaves store water, aiding in survival in arid or high-altitude conditions. Androsace lactiflora is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and limestone soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
