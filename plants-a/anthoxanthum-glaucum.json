    "intro": "Anthoxanthum glaucum, commonly known as the bluish oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, bluish-green stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale yellow to brown florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Anthoxanthum glaucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
