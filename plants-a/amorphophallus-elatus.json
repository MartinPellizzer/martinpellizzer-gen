    "intro": "Amorphophallus elatus, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces striking white flowers with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts pollinators like flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The tuberous roots of this plant are used in traditional medicine and as a food source in some cultures."
