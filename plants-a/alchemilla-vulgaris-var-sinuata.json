    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that have a distinctive sinuous or wavy edge. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and are also popular in ornamental gardening for their attractive foliage."
