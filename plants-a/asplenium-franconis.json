    "intro": "Asplenium franconis, commonly known as the Franconian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and is typically found growing on rocks or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rosette-shaped growth pattern with closely packed, lanceolate leaves. Asplenium franconis is native to parts of Europe and is often found in mountainous regions. It plays a minor ecological role in its habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for small invertebrates."
