It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are typically dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with a distinctive, flaky texture. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",
