    "intro": "Amsonia tomentosa var. tomentosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in soft, grayish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its foliage is lance-shaped and turns a striking coppery color in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established."
