    "intro": "Albuca fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
