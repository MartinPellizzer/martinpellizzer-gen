    "intro": "Acinos arvensis var. argutus, commonly known as the rough hawkbit, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a dense, compact inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its ability to colonize such environments makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession.",
