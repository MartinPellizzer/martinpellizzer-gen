    "intro": "Arenaria cherleriae var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features a compact rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces a single, showy white or pink flower per stem. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky crevices or on slopes, where it can tolerate full sun and minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
