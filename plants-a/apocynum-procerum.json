    "intro": "Apocynum procerum, commonly known as the tall milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Apocynum procerum is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
