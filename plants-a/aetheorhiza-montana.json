    "intro": "Aetheorhiza montana, commonly known as the mountain lichen, is a species of foliose lichen that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its leaf-like thallus, which is typically green or yellowish in color. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, enabling it to photosynthesize. It is often found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in forested areas. Due to its sensitivity to air pollution, it is considered an indicator species for environmental health."
