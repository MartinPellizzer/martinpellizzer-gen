    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. transsilvanica, commonly known as Transylvanian mousegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, fertile soils and is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the typical Agrostis canina."
