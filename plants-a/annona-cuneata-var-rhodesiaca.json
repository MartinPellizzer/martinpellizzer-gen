    "intro": "Annona cuneata var. rhodesiaca, commonly known as the Rhodesian custard apple, is a tropical plant native to eastern and southern Africa. It is a small tree or shrub characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by large, green, fleshy fruits with a sweet, custard-like pulp. The fruit is edible, though the seeds are typically inedible and contain toxic compounds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
