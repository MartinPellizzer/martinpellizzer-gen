    "intro": "Acacia confusa, commonly known as the Chinese flame acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and feathery, bipinnate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods and are often used in traditional medicine. Acacia confusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia confusa belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their simple vascular structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of flowering plants that are often legumes, characterized by their ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, which includes plants with distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. Its genus is Acacia, a large group of shrubs and trees native to Africa, Australia, and the Americas, known for their acicular leaves and pod fruits. Its species is Acacia confusa, a specific type of acacia found in Southeast Asia, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia confusa is primarily native to Borneo, Malaya, Philippines, Sumatera, and Taiwan. This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in the ecosystems of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia confusa was mainly introduced to Caroline Is., China South-Central, China Southeast, Dominican Republic, Hainan, Hawaii, India, Marianas, Mauritius, Myanmar, Nansei-shoto, Ogasawara-shoto, Seychelles, and Vietnam. It has been widely established in these regions, often as an ornamental plant or for soil stabilization. The species is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, contributing to its widespread distribution. However, in some areas, it has become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts depending on the region."
