    "intro": "Albizia rubiginosa, commonly known as the red mimosas, is a leguminous shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosa plant, and its showy, clustered pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular ornamental in gardens. Its pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, and the plant has a shallow root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Albizia rubiginosa is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
