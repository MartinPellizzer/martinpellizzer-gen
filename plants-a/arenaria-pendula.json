    "intro": "Arenaria pendula, commonly known as the hanging sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features succulent, mat-forming stems that hang downward, giving it a unique, cascading appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. Arenaria pendula thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or coastal areas."
