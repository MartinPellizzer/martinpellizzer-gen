    "intro": "Acrosorus, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Salviniales. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as lakes and ponds. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Acrosorus plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to surrounding water life."
