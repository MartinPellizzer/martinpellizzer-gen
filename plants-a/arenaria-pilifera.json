    "intro": "Arenaria pilifera, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Arenaria pilifera is part of the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes other flowering plants with showy blooms. Its ability to survive in nutrient-poor environments makes it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
