    "intro": "Asparagus scaberulus, commonly known as rough asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in branched umbels. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough texture due to the presence of tiny, stiff hairs. The plant is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and in open woodlands."
