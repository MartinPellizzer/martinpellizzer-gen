    "intro": "Alyssum borysthenicum, commonly known as the Crimean alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of southern Russia and Ukraine. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alyssum borysthenicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
