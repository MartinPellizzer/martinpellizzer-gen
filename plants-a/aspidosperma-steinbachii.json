    "intro": "Aspidosperma steinbachii, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon basin. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, glossy green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The tree produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a source of natural compounds and its ecological importance in the rainforest. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit."
