    "intro": "Alysicarpus nummularioides, commonly known as the small-leaf burr vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a climbing legume characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive burr-like fruits. The plant produces yellow or pale green flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its fruits are dry, dehiscent pods that release seeds when mature. Alysicarpus nummularioides is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
