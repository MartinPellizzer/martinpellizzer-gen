    "intro": "Alsine pumilio, commonly known as the dwarf sand-verbena, is a low-growing annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of only a few centimeters, with small, narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, pale blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and ecological restoration projects."
