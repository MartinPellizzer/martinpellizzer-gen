    "intro": "Allohemia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, ephemeral blooms that appear only under specific environmental conditions. The flowers are typically small and inconspicuous, with a structure that includes cyathia, which are specialized cup-like structures containing the reproductive organs. Allohemia species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to survive in harsh, dry climates. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, these plants are of interest to botanists and conservationists."
