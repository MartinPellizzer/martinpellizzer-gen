    "intro": "Aster altaicus f. discoideus, commonly known as the alpine aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with its hairy foliage and deep root system. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
