    "intro": "Asplenium praemorsum var. angustitripinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a dense, carpet-like growth on rocky or shaded substrates. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high moisture levels. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of its fertile fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
