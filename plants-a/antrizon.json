    "intro": "Antrizon, commonly known as the purple coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, violet to purple petals surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption. Antrizon thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for native gardens."
