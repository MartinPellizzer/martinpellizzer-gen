    "intro": "Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Its heartwood is highly valued for its aromatic properties and is used in the production of incense and fine furniture. The plant has a deep root system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and withstand periods of drought.",
