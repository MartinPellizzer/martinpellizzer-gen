This variant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. It thrives in open woodlands, along riverbanks, and in disturbed soils where it can receive ample sunlight. The plant is well adapted to coastal and inland environments, often growing near human settlements. Its native range extends to parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands, where it has been introduced and naturalized.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum var. populifolium was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. It is commonly found in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, and Peru. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and flowering habits. It has been introduced to various areas for horticultural purposes, including as a decorative shrub. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
