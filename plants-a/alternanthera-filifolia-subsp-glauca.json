    "intro": "Alternanthera filifolia subsp. glauca, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America. It features striking blue-violet bracts that resemble misty clouds, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous true flowers that appear in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for water gardens and bog landscapes."
