    "intro": "Ascocentrum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature orchid or dwarf orchid, is a species of epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, and it prefers well-draining soil and indirect sunlight. Ascocentrum miniatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ease of care in indoor settings."
