    "intro": "Agave funifera, commonly known as the \"suspension agave,\" is a succulent plant native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 1.5 meters in length. The plant is notable for its ability to grow in arid and rocky environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions. It produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in the plant's lifetime. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
