    "intro": "Asperula aspera var. brachystegia, commonly known as the dwarf alpine azalea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are densely packed, giving it a dense, bushy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate cold climates."
