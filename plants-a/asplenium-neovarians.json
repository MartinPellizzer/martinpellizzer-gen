    "intro": "Asplenium neovarians, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus structures on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium neovarians is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
