    "intro": "Aesculus hippocastanum f. beaumanii, commonly known as the Beaumanii horse chestnut, is a botanical variant of the horse chestnut tree. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that bloom in late spring, adding ornamental value to gardens. The leaves are palmately compound, typically with five to seven leaflets, and are arranged in a feathery pattern. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for its fruit, which is less abundant than in the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
