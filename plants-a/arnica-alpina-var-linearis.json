    "intro": "Arnica alpina var. linearis, commonly known as the alpine tawnpiece, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions. Its flowers are composed of tubular petals arranged in a radial pattern, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic alpine environments."
