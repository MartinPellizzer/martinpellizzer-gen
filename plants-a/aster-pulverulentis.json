    "intro": "Aster pulverulentis, commonly known as the dust aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, branching stems that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and a yellow center, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in tiny, glandular hairs that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Aster pulverulentis is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
