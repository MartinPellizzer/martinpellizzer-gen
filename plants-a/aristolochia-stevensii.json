    "intro": "Aristolochia stevensii, commonly known as the purple swallowwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, purple to brownish flowers that resemble a bird's beak. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found in moist, wooded areas. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex chemical compounds. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species."
