    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. magellanica, commonly known as the Magellan's thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to southern South America. It features compact, silver-gray foliage and produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical name reflects its geographic origin and its close relation to the common thrift plant."
