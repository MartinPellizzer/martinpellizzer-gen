    "intro": "Andersoniella hammelii, commonly known as the Hammel's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom sparingly, often in the understorey where light is limited. The plant has a unique morphology, featuring a short, creeping rhizome and a single, narrow leaf that supports its small inflorescence. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat destruction and over-collection. Botanists study this species to better understand its ecological requirements and to develop strategies for its preservation."
