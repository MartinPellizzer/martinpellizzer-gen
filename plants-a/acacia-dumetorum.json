    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia dumetorum is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and sandy soils. The plant thrives in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. It is often seen growing along roadsides, in savannas, and in disturbed areas. Acacia dumetorum is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia dumetorum was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, grasslands, and agricultural fields. It thrives in regions with a warm, dry climate and is commonly found in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean. This plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in some regions due to its invasive potential. It is often used for erosion control and as a source of timber and fodder."
