    "intro": "Aulacospermum rupestre, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid conditions. Aulacospermum rupestre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
