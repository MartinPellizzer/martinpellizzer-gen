    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia retinodes var. uncifolia is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variety is often associated with open woodlands and shrublands, thriving in low rainfall environments. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia retinodes var. uncifolia was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system. This plant thrives in full sun and is adaptable to various soil types, making it a popular choice for reclamation projects. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its unique foliage and ability to provide habitat for local wildlife. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
