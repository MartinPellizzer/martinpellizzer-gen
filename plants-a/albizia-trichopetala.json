    "intro": "Albizia trichopetala, commonly known as the red sandalwood tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often trifoliate or pinnate, and its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The tree produces long, slender pods that contain flat, seed-rich seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Additionally, it plays an important role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
