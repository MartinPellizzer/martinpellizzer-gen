    "intro": "Asplenium prionurus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. Asplenium prionurus is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
