    "intro": "Agropyron hatusimae, commonly known as the Hatusima wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
