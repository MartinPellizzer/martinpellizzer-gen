    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanum brachylobium is primarily native to the southern United States, specifically Texas and New Mexico. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, including plains and rocky hills. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It is adapted to hot, dry climates and is part of the Asteraceae family. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within the southwestern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanum brachylobium was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and disturbed forests. It thrives in regions with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered environments. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
