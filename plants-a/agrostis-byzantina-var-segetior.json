    "intro": "Agrostis byzantina var. segetior, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows, pastures, and wetlands. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in panicles, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in varied soil conditions."
