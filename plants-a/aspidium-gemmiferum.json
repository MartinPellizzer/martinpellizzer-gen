    "intro": "Aspidium gemmiferum, commonly known as the gemmiferous water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae. The plant produces spores in sori located on the underside of its fronds, which are covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Aspidium gemmiferum is also known for its ability to propagate through gemmae, small vegetative buds that can develop into new plants."
