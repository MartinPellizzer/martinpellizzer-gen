    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. subglabricalyx, commonly known as the coastal acaena, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of New Zealand. It features dense clusters of small, spiny stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Its fruit is a dry, three-lobed capsule that contains small, hard seeds.",

This variety is commonly found in dry to semi-arid environments, including grasslands and shrublands. It thrives in areas with well-drained soils and moderate to high sunlight exposure. The plant is often associated with coastal and inland valleys, where it forms part of the local vegetation. Its distribution is closely linked to specific ecological niches that support its growth and survival.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina var. subglabricalyx was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. This variety is a hybrid between Acaena ovina and Acaena subglabricalyx. It has since become naturalized in certain areas, particularly in the northern regions of the country. However, it is not considered invasive and poses minimal ecological risk."
