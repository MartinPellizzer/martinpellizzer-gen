It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, narrow leaves and small white flowers. The plant is notable for its pungent, garlic-like scent, which is produced by compounds in its foliage. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas.
