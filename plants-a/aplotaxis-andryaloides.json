It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and compound leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
