    "intro": "Aspalathus cytisoides var. decumbens, commonly known as the yellow bushveld clover, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and small, yellowish-green leaves that are trifoliate in structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
