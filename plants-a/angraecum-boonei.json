    "intro": "Angraecum boonei, commonly known as the Boone's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences bearing fragrant, white or pale blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Angraecum boonei is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
