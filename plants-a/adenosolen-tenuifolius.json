It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. Native to parts of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in forest understories. The plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties.",
