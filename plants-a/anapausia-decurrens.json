It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually blue or purple in color, with five petals. Anapausia decurrens has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
