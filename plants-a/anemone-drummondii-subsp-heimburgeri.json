    "intro": "Anemone drummondii subsp. heimburgeri, commonly known as the Heimburger's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and desert scrub. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly larger flowers and more robust growth compared to other anemone species in the region."
