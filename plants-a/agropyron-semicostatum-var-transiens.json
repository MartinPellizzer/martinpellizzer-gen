    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum var. transiens, commonly known as the Transverse needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important role in ecological restoration projects."
