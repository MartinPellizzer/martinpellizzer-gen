    "intro": "Allium fimbriatum subsp. purdyi, commonly known as the Sierra Valley garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to garlic, though they are typically smaller and more delicate. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and open woodlands. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and subspecies-specific traits that set it apart from other Allium species."
