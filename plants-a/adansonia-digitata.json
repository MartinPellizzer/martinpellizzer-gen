    "intro": "Adansonia digitata, commonly known as the baobab tree, is a large, deciduous tree native to the dry regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, bottle-shaped trunk that stores large amounts of water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree has broad, umbrella-like leaves and produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds. Its flowers are typically white or pink and are pollinated by bats and insects. The bark and leaves of the baobab have been used for various medicinal and culinary purposes by local communities.",
