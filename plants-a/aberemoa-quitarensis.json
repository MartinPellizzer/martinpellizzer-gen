    "intro": "Aberemoa quitarensis, commonly known as the Quitara orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from rocky soils, and it often forms symbiotic relationships with specific fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aberemoa quitarensis is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa quitarensis is primarily native to the Andean region of South America, specifically in the high-altitude grasslands of Peru and Bolivia. It is commonly found in the valleys and slopes of the Andes, where the climate is cool and temperate. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or mountainous terrain. Its distribution is limited to a relatively small geographic area, making it a regionally significant species. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Aberemoa quitarensis is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa quitarensis was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires regular watering to maintain its health. It has been introduced to several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia. However, its spread outside its native range is limited due to specific environmental requirements."
