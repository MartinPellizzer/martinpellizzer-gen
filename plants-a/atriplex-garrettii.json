    "intro": "Atriplex garrettii, commonly known as silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce transpiration and are often covered in a waxy coating. It produces small greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Atriplex garrettii is adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing desert landscapes."
