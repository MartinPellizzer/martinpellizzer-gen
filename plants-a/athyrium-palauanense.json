    "intro": "Athyrium palauanense, commonly known as the Palau fern, is a rare species native to the island of Palau in the Western Pacific. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it forms dense, low-growing clusters. Its spores are dispersed through the air, contributing to its propagation in suitable microhabitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
