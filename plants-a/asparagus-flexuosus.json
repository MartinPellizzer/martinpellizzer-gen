    "intro": "Asparagus flexuosus, commonly known as the creeping asparagus, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, needle-like spears. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asparagus flexuosus is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
