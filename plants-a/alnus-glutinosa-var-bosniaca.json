    "intro": "Alnus glutinosa var. bosniaca, commonly known as the Bosnian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, spherical fruits called samaras, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration and ecological succession."
