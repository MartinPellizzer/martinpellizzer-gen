It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, characterized by its upright, woody stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces vibrant clusters of pink or purple flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.",
