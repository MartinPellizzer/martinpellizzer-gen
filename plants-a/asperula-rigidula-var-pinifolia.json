    "intro": "Asperula rigidula var. pinifolia, commonly known as the pineleaf woodruff, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are narrow and needle-like, resembling pine needles, which is reflected in its botanical name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
