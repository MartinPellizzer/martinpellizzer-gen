It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, hairy center, and its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil. Anemone rossii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
