    "intro": "Astragalus scalaris var. quercetinus, commonly known as the quercetin-bearing milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces pods that contain small, hard seeds. This variety is notable for its chemical composition, particularly the presence of quercetin, a flavonoid compound with potential medicinal properties."
