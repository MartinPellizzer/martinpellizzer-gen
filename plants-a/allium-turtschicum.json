    "intro": "Allium turtschicum, commonly known as the Crimean garlic, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features a bulbous stem with fleshy, white or pale blue bulbs that are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine. The plant has strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from other Allium species, particularly in its unique floral structure and bulb morphology."
