    "intro": "Anthemis carpatica f. nigra, commonly known as the black anthemis, is a compact, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Carpathian region. It features dark purple to almost black flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking contrast to its gray-green foliage. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry garden beds. Its unique coloration and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
