    "intro": "Aconitum cernuum var. confertum, commonly known as the nodding monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
