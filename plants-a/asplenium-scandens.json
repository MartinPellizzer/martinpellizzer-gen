    "intro": "Asplenium scandens, commonly known as the wandering spider fern, is a climbing fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features feathery, glossy, and often dark green fronds that can grow quite long. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and climb over surfaces. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in humid forests. Its unique appearance and ability to climb make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
