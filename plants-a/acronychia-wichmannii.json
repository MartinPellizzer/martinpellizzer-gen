    "intro": "Acronychia wichmannii, commonly known as the Wimmera acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open forests and woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species.",
