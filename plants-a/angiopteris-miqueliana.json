    "intro": "Angiopteris miqueliana, commonly known as the Miquel's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water ferns. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Angiopteris miqueliana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
