It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with distinctive markings. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on forest floors or in rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
