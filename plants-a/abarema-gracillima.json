This species is found in the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. It thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within this biome. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema gracillima was mainly introduced to regions with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in South America. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for ornamental landscaping. The plant is known for its delicate, fern-like foliage and clusters of small, white flowers. It has been cultivated in several countries for its aesthetic value and adaptability. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native ecosystems."
