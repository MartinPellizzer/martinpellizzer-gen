It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the endangered pipevine swallowtail."
