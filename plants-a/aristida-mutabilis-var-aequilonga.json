    "intro": "Aristida mutabilis var. aequilonga, commonly known as the long-stemmed threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, three-awned spikelets that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces delicate, pale green to brown inflorescences. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in arid conditions."
