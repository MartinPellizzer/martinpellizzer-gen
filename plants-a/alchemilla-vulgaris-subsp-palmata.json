    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris subsp. palmata, commonly known as the palmate lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The leaves are used in traditional herbal medicine and are also valued in garden settings for their ornamental appearance."
