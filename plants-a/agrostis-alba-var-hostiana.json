    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. hostiana, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-blue foliage and produces fluffy, white to pale brown seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. It has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive bluish hue, and its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
