    "intro": "Arachnorchis startiorum, commonly known as the golden spider-orchid, is a striking orchid species native to the wet tropical regions of Australia. It is characterized by its intricate, spider-like floral structure, which features a prominent, golden-colored lip and a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rainforest or heathland habitats. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting specific pollinators such as bees and wasps. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
