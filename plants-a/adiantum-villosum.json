    "intro": "Adiantum villosum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are covered in soft, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination. The plant's rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates.",
