    "intro": "Allantodia glingensis, commonly known as the Glingen's Allantoid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of Glingen. It belongs to the family Allantoidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale pink to soft white. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect excess sunlight. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found growing in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
