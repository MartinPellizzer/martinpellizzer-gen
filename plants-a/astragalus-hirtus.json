    "intro": "Astragalus hirtus, commonly known as hairy milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to North America and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus hirtus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystems."
