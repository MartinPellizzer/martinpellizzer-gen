    "intro": "Aspidogyne, commonly known as the African buttercup, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Rubiaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in the savannas and forests. Aspidogyne species are characterized by their showy, yellow or orange flowers that resemble those of the buttercup. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often with opposite, simple leaves. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
