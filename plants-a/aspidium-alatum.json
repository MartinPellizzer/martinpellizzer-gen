    "intro": "Aspidium alatum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, spreading habit. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth system, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
