    "intro": "Asperula fedtschenkoi, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's evergreen azalea, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and rhododendrons, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in regions with cool, moist climates."
