    "intro": "Avena lodunensis, commonly known as the lodun oat, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-bearing panicle, which produces small, two-lobed flowers. Avena lodunensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
