    "intro": "Agenora, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique plant species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the light, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in humid environments. Agenora is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its rare and striking visual features."
