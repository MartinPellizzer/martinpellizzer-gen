It is commonly found in forested areas, particularly in mountainous regions with a temperate climate. This variant is known for its distinctive glaucous foliage, which helps it adapt to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed deciduous and evergreen forests. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. glaucus was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, typically found in regions of East Asia. It thrives in forested environments, often growing as a shrub or small tree. This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions where it benefits from partial shade and moderate humidity. Its introduction has been noted in several botanical gardens and conservation areas due to its ornamental value. However, it is considered invasive in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
