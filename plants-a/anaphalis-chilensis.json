    "intro": "Anaphalis chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean goatweed, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, adapting to harsh environmental conditions with its hairy, silver-green foliage. Its flowers, which appear in the form of small, clustered heads, are often white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Anaphalis chilensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
