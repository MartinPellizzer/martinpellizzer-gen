    "intro": "Arenaria rubra, commonly known as red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Arenaria rubra is an important component of high-altitude ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing food for local wildlife."
