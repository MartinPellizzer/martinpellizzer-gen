    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for turfgrass applications. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along riverbanks. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, spikelet-based flowers. The species is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
