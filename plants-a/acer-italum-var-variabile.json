    "intro": "Acer italum var. variabile, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with lobes ranging from deeply cut to nearly entire, depending on the specific population. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different soil conditions.",
