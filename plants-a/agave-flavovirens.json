    "intro": "Agave flavovirens, commonly known as the yellow-green agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically a combination of yellow and green hues. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid environments. It produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by the development of blue-green berries. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
