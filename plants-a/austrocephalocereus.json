    "intro": "Austrocephalocereus, commonly known as the Easter Island cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Chatham Islands. It is characterized by its columnar stem and is typically found in rocky, coastal environments. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Austrocephalocereus is adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions and has a slow growth rate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
