    "intro": "Androsace maxima f. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flowered rock sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower per stem, typically in shades of white or pink, during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy alpine plant. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
