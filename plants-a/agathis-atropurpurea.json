    "intro": "Agathis atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple-leafed ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves that often display a striking purple hue, especially when young. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing hard, oily seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay, making it useful in construction and furniture-making. Agathis atropurpurea thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests."
