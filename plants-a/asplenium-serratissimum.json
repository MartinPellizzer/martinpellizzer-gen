    "intro": "Asplenium serratissimum, commonly known as the serrate spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with serrated margins, which give it its common name. It produces spores in clusters called sorangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium serratissimum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
