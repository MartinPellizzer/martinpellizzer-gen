    "intro": "Acer tutcheri subsp. confertifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically broad and have a serrated margin. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
