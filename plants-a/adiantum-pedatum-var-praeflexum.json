    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum var. praeflexum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a variant of the royal fern that is native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat.",
