    "intro": "Achillea grandiflora, commonly known as the tall yarrow, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy composite flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. Achillea grandiflora is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. It is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its use has declined in modern herbal medicine.",
