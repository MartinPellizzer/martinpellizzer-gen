It features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, often with a contrasting throat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is a sought-after species among botanists and horticulturists."
