    "intro": "Acacia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow, globular flower heads that emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Acacia suaveolens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens is primarily native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. This plant is commonly found in various habitats across these regions, including dry forests, woodlands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the diverse climates and soils of its native range. Acacia suaveolens is often seen growing in open or semi-open environments, thriving in full sun. Its distribution reflects its ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia suaveolens was mainly introduced to Jawa for its ornamental value and potential ecological benefits. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, open woodlands, and degraded habitats. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it well-suited to the environmental conditions of Jawa. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and human-altered landscapes. However, its impact on native flora and fauna requires further study to assess its ecological role."
