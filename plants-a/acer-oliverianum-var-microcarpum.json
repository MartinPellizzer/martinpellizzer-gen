    "intro": "Acer oliverianum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant produces small, winged samaras that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows to a height of less than 3 meters, making it well-suited for rock gardens or as a decorative plant. Its botanical characteristics include smooth, gray-barked stems and a compact, rounded form.",
