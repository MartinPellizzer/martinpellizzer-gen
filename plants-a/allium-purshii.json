    "intro": "Allium purshii, commonly known as the Pursh onion or mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous base and strap-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in the summer, which are typically arranged in a spherical or cylindrical inflorescence. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a valuable plant in both culinary and medicinal contexts. Allium purshii thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
