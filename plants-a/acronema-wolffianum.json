    "intro": "Acronema wolffianum, commonly known as the Wolffian acronema, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, also known as the carrot or parsley family. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits called schizocarps, which split into two one-seeded parts upon maturity. Native to certain regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices.",
