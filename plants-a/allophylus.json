    "intro": "Allophylus, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in cup-like structures called cyathia, which are characteristic of the Euphorbiaceae family. The fruits are usually capsules that contain several seeds, and the plants are often used in traditional medicine or as ornamental plants."
