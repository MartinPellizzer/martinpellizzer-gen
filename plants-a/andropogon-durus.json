    "intro": "Andropogon durus, commonly known as tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces tall, slender inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon durus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
