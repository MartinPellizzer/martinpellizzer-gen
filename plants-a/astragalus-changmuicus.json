It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance makes it a subject of interest for conservation and botanical research."
