    "intro": "Arenaria tetragyna var. imbricata, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It features small, four-petaled white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, mat-forming foliage that helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color and covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions across Europe and Asia."
