    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pink flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
