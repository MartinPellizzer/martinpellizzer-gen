    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena poterioides is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the northern and central regions. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the lower North Island and parts of the South Island. Acaena poterioides is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in association with other indigenous plant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena poterioides was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. It has since become naturalized in various regions, particularly in coastal and subalpine areas. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and can germinate in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand."
