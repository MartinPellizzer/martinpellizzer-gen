    "intro": "Artemisia laciniatiformis, commonly known as the fringed wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in loose panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
