    "intro": "Allium montanostepposum, commonly known as the mountain steppe garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers during the summer months. Its bulbs are similar to those of other allium species, containing sulfur compounds that give them a strong garlic odor. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for various insects and contributing to soil stability."
