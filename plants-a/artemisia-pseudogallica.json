The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Its essential oils, rich in compounds like thujone, make it valuable in both traditional medicine and culinary applications."
