    "intro": "Aechmea kautskyana, commonly known as the Kautsky's pineapple plant, is a species of bromeliad native to the cloud forests of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red bracts and small white flowers, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea kautskyana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ability to adapt to indoor conditions."
