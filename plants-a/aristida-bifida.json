    "intro": "Aristida bifida, commonly known as the splitgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Aristida bifida is valued for its drought tolerance and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
