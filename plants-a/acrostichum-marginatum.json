    "intro": "Acrostichum marginatum, commonly known as the marginal fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the fern family, characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive marginal vein. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in coastal areas or near freshwater bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it anchor in wet soil, while its spore-bearing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. The marginal fern is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
