    "intro": "Alsine thomasiana, commonly known as the Thomas's alsine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clustered, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs in spring and early summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Alsine thomasiana is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
