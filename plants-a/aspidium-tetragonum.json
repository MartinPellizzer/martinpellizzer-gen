    "intro": "Aspidium tetragonum, commonly known as the four-angled water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, four-angled fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium tetragonum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
