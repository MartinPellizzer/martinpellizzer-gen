    "intro": "Austrostipa curticoma, commonly known as the slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Austrostipa curticoma plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
