    "intro": "Acetosella erioclados, commonly known as the sticky willow or spring beauty, is a low-growing perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features small, clustered flowers that are often pink or white, blooming in early spring. The plant has hairy, sometimes sticky leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its preferred moist, woodland habitats. It is often found in shaded areas such as forest floors and along stream banks. Acetosella erioclados is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators.",
