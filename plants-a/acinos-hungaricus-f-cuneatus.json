    "intro": "Acinos hungaricus f. cuneatus, commonly known as the Hungarian acino, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Hungary. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It is adapted to harsh alpine conditions and is considered a vulnerable species due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity. Conservation efforts are essential to protect this unique botanical specimen.",
