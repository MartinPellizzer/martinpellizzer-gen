    "intro": "Ardernia fuscata, commonly known as the New Zealand swamp reed, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its slender, grass-like stems are often clustered, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters at the base of the stems. Ardernia fuscata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
