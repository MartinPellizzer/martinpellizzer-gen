    "intro": "Alchemilla straminea, commonly known as yellow lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are arranged in a panicle-like structure. Its leaves are known for their ability to retain water, a feature that helps it thrive in moist, woodland environments. Alchemilla straminea is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
