    "intro": "Antennaria arida, commonly known as the desert mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant has a compact growth form, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its flowers typically bloom in spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Antennaria arida is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations."
