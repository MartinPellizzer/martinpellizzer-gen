    "intro": "Arenaria murcica, commonly known as the Murcia sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
