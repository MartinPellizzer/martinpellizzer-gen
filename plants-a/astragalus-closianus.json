    "intro": "Astragalus closianus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus closianus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators."
