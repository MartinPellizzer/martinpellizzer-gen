    "intro": "Aspalathus phylicoides, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is primarily cultivated for its leaves, which are used to produce a caffeine-free herbal tea. The botanical features of Aspalathus phylicoides make it well-suited to the Mediterranean climate of its native habitat."
