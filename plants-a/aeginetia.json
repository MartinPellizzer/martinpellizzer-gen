    "intro": "Aeginetia, commonly known as the sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Amaranthaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Aeginetia species are characterized by their small, clustered flowers and hairy, often succulent leaves. They are often used in traditional medicine and have also been studied for their potential in phytoremediation. The genus includes several species, such as Aeginetia lobata and Aeginetia sessilis, which vary in growth form and habitat preferences."
