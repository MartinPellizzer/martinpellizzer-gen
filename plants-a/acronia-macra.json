    "intro": "Acronia macra, commonly known as the giant flame flower, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, red-orange bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the bracts. Acronia macra thrives in warm, humid environments and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor cultivation.",
