    "intro": "Angadenia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Orchidaceae. It is native to Australia and is characterized by its unique, delicate, and often ephemeral blooms. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, fragrant flowers that are often pale in color. Angadenia species are known for their short flowering period, which makes them rare and difficult to observe. Due to their habitat specificity and limited distribution, many species are considered endangered."
