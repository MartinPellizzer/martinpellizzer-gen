    "intro": "Astragalus deinacanthus subsp. judaicus, commonly known as the Judean milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Israel and southern Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in limestone soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
