    "intro": "Asplenium laciniatum var. planicaule, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its broad, leathery fronds. It is a terrestrial fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth. The plant has a delicate, lace-like appearance with finely divided pinnae that give it a distinctive, ornamental look. It reproduces via spores, which are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
