    "intro": "Asplenium procerum, commonly known as the tall holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dark brown, wiry rhizomes that help it spread and colonize moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and the spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium procerum thrives in humid, shaded areas and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
