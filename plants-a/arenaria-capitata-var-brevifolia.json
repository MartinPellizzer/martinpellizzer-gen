It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth habit with narrow, blue-green leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is distinguished by its shorter stature compared to the typical form of Arenaria capitata."
