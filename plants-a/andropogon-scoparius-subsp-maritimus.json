It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in marshes and dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny florets. Its root system helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. It plays an important ecological role in saltwater habitats by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
