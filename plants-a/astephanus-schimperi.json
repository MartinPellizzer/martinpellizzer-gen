    "intro": "Astephanus schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian star grass, is a perennial herb native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of grasses, and is adapted to thrive in rocky and arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, providing some resistance to drought and grazing. Astephanus schimperi is often found in open habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters, where it plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
