    "intro": "Aspidium molle var. didymosorus, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a variant of the broad shield fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae, characterized by its fronds that are typically leathery and often have a distinctive, broad shape. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptations and its role in ecological systems."
