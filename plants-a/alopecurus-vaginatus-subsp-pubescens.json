    "intro": "Alopecurus vaginatus subsp. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow with a hairy underside. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
