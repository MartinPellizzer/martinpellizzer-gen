    "intro": "Aubrieta deltoidea var. sicula, commonly known as Sicilian rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value. This variety is particularly adapted to Mediterranean climates and requires minimal water once established."
