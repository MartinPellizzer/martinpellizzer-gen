    "intro": "Astragalus brachycephalus, commonly known as the short-headed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus brachycephalus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
