    "intro": "Allium abramsii, commonly known as Abrams' onion, is a rare, flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall stem bearing a single, globe-shaped flower cluster with purple to pinkish blooms. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
