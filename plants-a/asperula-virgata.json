    "intro": "Asperula virgata, commonly known as sweet woodruff, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces tiny, urn-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters. Its leaves are heart-shaped and emit a sweet, vanilla-like aroma when crushed. Asperula virgata is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
