    "intro": "Acalypha mutisii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or silverleaf acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from silver to deep green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha mutisii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique leaf texture.",

This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forests or along riverbanks. It is commonly distributed in the departments of Nari\u00f1o, Putumayo, and Cauca. Its native range is limited to specific ecological zones within Colombia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mutisii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, wastelands, and forest edges. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and moderate to high rainfall. The plant is often found in regions with poor soil quality, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive potential. It is commonly reported in countries across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa."
