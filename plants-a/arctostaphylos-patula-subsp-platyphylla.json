    "intro": "Arctostaphylos patula subsp. platyphylla, commonly known as the flatleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The leaves are leathery, lance-shaped, and often have a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers."
