It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
