    "intro": "Andropogon gangeticus, commonly known as giant miscanthus, is a tall perennial grass native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It features robust, fibrous roots and can grow up to 3 meters in height, with wide, blade-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces dense, fluffy panicles of small, white to pale pink flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to wet or marshy environments and is often found in floodplains and along riverbanks. Its rhizomes are sometimes used in traditional medicine and for thatching."
