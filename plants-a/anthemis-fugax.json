    "intro": "Anthemis fugax, commonly known as the annual ragwort, is an annual flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its short life cycle, it completes its growth and reproduction within a single growing season."
