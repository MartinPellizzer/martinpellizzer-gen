    "intro": "Alchemilla heptagona, commonly known as the seven-sided lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, seven-lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is known for its ability to retain moisture, making it drought-tolerant once established. Alchemilla heptagona is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine."
