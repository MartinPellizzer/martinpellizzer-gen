    "intro": "Aira brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian grass or *Aira* grass, is a perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and disturbed areas. Aira brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems."
