    "intro": "Austrobuxus megacarpus, commonly known as the giant holly, is a flowering plant native to eastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by large, fleshy berries that are typically red or orange when mature. Its leaves are evergreen and have a leathery texture, which helps it conserve water in its native habitat. Austrobuxus megacarpus is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and forested areas."
