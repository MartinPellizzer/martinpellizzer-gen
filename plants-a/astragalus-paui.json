    "intro": "Astragalus paui, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus paui plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing forage for wildlife."
