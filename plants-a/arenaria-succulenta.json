    "intro": "Arenaria succulenta, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
