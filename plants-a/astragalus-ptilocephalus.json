    "intro": "Astragalus ptilocephalus, commonly known as the hairy-headed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus ptilocephalus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
