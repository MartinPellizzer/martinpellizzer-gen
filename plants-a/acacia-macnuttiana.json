    "intro": "Acacia macnuttiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, bipinnate leaves and yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia macnuttiana is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and heathlands. It is well adapted to the dry and warm climate of the region. Acacia macnuttiana plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia macnuttiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. However, its rapid growth and spread have led to ecological concerns. The plant competes with native species and can alter the structure of local ecosystems. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on indigenous flora."
