It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, ivy-like leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Antirrhinum hederifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
