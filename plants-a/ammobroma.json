It consists of several species native to Africa, particularly in regions such as Sudan and Ethiopia. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, palmate leaves, and showy, yellow to red flowers. They often grow in dry, arid environments and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Some species of Ammobroma are used in traditional medicine and have ornamental value due to their unique appearance."
