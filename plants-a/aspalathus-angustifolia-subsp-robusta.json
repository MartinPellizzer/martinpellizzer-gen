    "intro": "Aspalathus angustifolia subsp. robusta, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that are typically not visible above ground. The plant is well adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate, thriving in well-drained, sandy soils. It is particularly noted for its unique ability to fix nitrogen, which enhances soil fertility. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a key species in the production of rooibos tea."
