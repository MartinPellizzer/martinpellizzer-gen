    "intro": "Agropyron patagonicum var. festucoides, commonly known as Patagonian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, two-lobed spikelets. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and deep root systems. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
