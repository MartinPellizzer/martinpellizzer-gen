    "intro": "Ariocarpus agavioides, commonly known as the Mexican cactus or stonecush, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ariocarpus agavioides is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
