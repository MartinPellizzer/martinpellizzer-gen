    "intro": "Astragalus zanskarensis subsp. oplites, commonly known as the Zanskar milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to cold and arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
