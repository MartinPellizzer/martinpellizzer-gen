    "intro": "Argyroxiphium kauense, commonly known as the Kauense silversword, is a rare endemic plant found in Hawaii. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in high-elevation, rocky habitats and is adapted to the unique climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered endangered."
