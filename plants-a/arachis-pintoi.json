    "intro": "Arachis pintoi, commonly known as grasspea, is a leguminous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces edible seeds that are rich in protein but contain toxic alkaloids if not properly processed. Arachis pintoi is often cultivated for both human consumption and as a forage crop for livestock. Its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen makes it a valuable crop in sustainable agricultural systems."
