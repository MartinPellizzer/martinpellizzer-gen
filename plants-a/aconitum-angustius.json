    "intro": "Aconitum angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and distinctive blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately divided, finely toothed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forested areas. Aconitum angustius contains toxic alkaloids, making it a plant that requires careful handling and appreciation from a safe distance.",
