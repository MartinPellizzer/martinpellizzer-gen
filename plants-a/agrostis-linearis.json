    "intro": "Agrostis linearis, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and lawns. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often hairless, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Agrostis linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
