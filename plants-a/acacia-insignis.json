    "intro": "Acacia insignis, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow globular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria. Its bark is smooth and greyish, often exfoliating to reveal a lighter inner layer. Acacia insignis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is a symbol of Australia's national identity.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia insignis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. It is commonly found in rocky outcrops, gravelly soils, and along riverbanks in these areas. This plant thrives in hot, dry climates and is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Acacia insignis is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes used in traditional medicine by local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia insignis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, arid climate. It is commonly found in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures, such as parts of Australia and the southwestern United States. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its distinctive foliage and yellow flowers. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
