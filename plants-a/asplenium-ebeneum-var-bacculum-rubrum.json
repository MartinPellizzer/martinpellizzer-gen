    "intro": "Asplenium ebeneum var. bacculum-rubrum, commonly known as the red-stalked maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Aspleniaceae). It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green with a reddish hue on the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
