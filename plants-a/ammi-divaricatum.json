    "intro": "Ammi divaricatum, commonly known as Indian hemlock, is a biennial or annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic and have a distinctive, slightly bitter scent. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the Apiaceae (carrot) family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, papery fruits called schizocarps, which release tiny seeds when disturbed. Ammi divaricatum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions."
