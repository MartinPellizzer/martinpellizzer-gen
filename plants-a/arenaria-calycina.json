    "intro": "Arenaria calycina, commonly known as the sand-verge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers in early summer, which are adapted for pollination by wind and insects. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in rocky or sandy soils. Arenaria calycina is well-suited to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
