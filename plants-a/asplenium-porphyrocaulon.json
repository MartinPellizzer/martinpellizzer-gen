    "intro": "Asplenium porphyrocaulon, commonly known as the purple-stem spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its dark, almost purplish stems. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a unique pattern along the undersides of the leaves. Asplenium porphyrocaulon is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
