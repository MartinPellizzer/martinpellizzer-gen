    "intro": "Alloteropsis paniculata, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces dense, tufted foliage with slender, grass-like blades and panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important pioneer species in stabilizing dunes. The plant's structure and growth habits reflect its evolutionary adaptations to salt spray, wind, and poor soil nutrients."
