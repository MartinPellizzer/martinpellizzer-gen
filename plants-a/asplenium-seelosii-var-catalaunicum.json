    "intro": "Asplenium seelosii var. catalaunicum, commonly known as the Catalaunic spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a serrated or toothed margin. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. This variety is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats across its native range in the Mediterranean region."
