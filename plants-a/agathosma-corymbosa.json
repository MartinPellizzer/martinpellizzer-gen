    "intro": "Agathosma corymbosa, commonly known as the Cape geranium, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, aromatic leaves and produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
