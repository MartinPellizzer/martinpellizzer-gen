    "intro": "Ammannia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed ammannia, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and marshes. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or red, and they bloom in summer. Ammannia longipes is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
