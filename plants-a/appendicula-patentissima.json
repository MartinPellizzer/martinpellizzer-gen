    "intro": "Appendicula patentissima, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are thin and elongated, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Appendicula patentissima is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor environments."
