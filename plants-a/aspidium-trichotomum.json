    "intro": "Aspidium trichotomum, commonly known as the three-part spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often divided into three parts, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are usually leathery and dark green. Aspidium trichotomum is a hardy, low-maintenance plant that is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
