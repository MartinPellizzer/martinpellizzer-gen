    "intro": "Austrobuxus rubiginosus, commonly known as the rusty boxwood, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-brown, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain native animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and open forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
