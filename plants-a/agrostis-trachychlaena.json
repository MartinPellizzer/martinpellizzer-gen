    "intro": "Agrostis trachychlaena, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy textures. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelets, which contain the reproductive structures. Agrostis trachychlaena is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
