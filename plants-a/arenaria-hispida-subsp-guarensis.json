    "intro": "Arenaria hispida subsp. guarensis, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of South America. It typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features small, fleshy leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its subspecies status reflects geographic and morphological distinctions from the main species. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to harsh conditions."
