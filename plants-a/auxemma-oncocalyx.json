    "intro": "Auxemma oncocalyx, commonly known as the red-flowered tamarind, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that eventually develop into woody, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The fruit's outer covering is thick and leathery, which helps protect the seeds inside. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of timber."
