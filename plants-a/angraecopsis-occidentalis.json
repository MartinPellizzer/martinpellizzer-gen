    "intro": "Angraecopsis occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Star of Africa, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with a thick, fleshy stem that stores water. Its flowers attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths, due to their scent and color. Angraecopsis occidentalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
