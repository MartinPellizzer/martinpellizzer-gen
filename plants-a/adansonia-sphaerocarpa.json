It is characterized by its massive, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The tree produces large, white, fragrant flowers and has long, narrow leaves that are opposite in arrangement. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains numerous seeds surrounded by a fibrous pulp. The baobab is also known for its ecological and cultural significance in its native region.",
