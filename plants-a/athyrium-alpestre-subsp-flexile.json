    "intro": "Athyrium alpestre subsp. flexile, commonly known as the flexible lady fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often form a graceful, arching shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are wiry and help it spread through vegetative propagation. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
