    "intro": "Allophylus multicostatus, commonly known as the many-costed alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and dark green, glossy leaves that are often clustered at the ends of its branches. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early spring, which are followed by clusters of red berries that persist into the winter. Its leaves have a distinctive vein pattern, with multiple prominent costae, giving it its scientific name. Allophylus multicostatus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest understories and streamside habitats."
