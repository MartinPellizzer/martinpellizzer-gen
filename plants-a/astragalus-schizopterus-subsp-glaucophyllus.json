    "intro": "Astragalus schizopterus subsp. glaucophyllus, commonly known as the glaucophyllous milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its gray-green foliage, which reflects its adaptation to harsh, dry environments. It often grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well-suited to low-nutrient conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
