    "intro": "Aloe greenii, commonly known as the green aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green in color, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Aloe greenii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves can be used for ornamental purposes and have mild medicinal properties."
