    "intro": "Athyrium veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's shield fern, is a species of fern native to China. It belongs to the Dryopteris genus and is characterized by its large, leathery, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium veitchii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
