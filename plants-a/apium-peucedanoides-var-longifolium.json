    "intro": "Apium peucedanoides var. longifolium, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height, with hollow, ridged stems covered in white, hairy veins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in dense, branched clusters during its second year of growth. It is part of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is known for its toxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature and harmful properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
