It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are arranged in a cup-like structure. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
