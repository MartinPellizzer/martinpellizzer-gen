    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena philippii is primarily native to South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in temperate regions, particularly in the southern parts of these countries. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous environments. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones where it can adapt to the local climate and soil conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena philippii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. However, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
