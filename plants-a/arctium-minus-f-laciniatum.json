    "intro": "Arctium minus f. laciniatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved burdock, is a variant of the common burdock characterized by its finely lobed leaves. It is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces spiky, bract-covered flower heads that mature into woody, seed-containing burrs. Its leaves are usually narrower and more dissected compared to the typical form of Arctium minus. This plant is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
