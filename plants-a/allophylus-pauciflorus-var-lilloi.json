    "intro": "Allophylus pauciflorus var. lilloi, commonly known as the Lillo's alpine huckleberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, which are followed by edible berries. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
