    "intro": "Apowollastonia stirlingii subsp. stirlingii, commonly known as the Stirling's ghost gum, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a silvery-green upper surface with a pale underside, contributing to its striking visual appeal. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by elongated, woody fruits. This plant is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness."
