    "intro": "Angiopteris stellatosora, commonly known as the starry shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often adorned with distinctive star-shaped sori. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in a unique, star-like pattern along the undersides of the fronds."
