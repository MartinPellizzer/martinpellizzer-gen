This species is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Central America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in lowland areas. The plant is commonly associated with humid forests and shaded undergrowth. Its native distribution spans across several countries in Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon andrieuxii was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It has been widely cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of the Americas. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil and full sunlight. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds and vegetative reproduction make it a concern in certain regions."
