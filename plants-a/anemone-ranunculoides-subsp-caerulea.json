It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet, often with a contrasting yellow center. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
