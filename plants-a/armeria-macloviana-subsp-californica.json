It features dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and is well adapted to sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, thriving in full sun. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
