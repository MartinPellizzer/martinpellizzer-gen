    "intro": "Annona calcarata, commonly known as the mountain custard apple, is a small evergreen tree native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, yellowish-green fruits with a creamy, custard-like pulp. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns a deep orange color, indicating maturity. Annona calcarata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
