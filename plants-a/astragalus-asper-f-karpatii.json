    "intro": "Astragalus asper f. karpatii, commonly known as the Carpathian milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the Astragalus genus. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Native to the Carpathian Mountains, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and pinnately compound, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
