    "intro": "Avenula alpina subsp. pseudoviolacea, commonly known as the alpine false violets, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, violet-blue flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
