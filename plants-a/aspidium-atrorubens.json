    "intro": "Aspidium atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown fronds that are typically dense and leathery in texture. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Aspidium atrorubens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
