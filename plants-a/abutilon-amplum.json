    "intro": "Abutilon amplum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woollypod abutilon, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ornamental species in tropical and subtropical regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon amplum is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern regions of the state, particularly in the coastal areas and surrounding heathlands. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is commonly observed in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry and sunny conditions typical of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the western part of Australia, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon amplum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas. The plant spreads through seeds dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
