    "intro": "Anil uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower anil, is a herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor environments. Anil uniflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and potential medicinal properties."
