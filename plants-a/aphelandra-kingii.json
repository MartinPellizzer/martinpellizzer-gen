    "intro": "Aphelandra kingii, commonly known as the golden flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a deep green with a metallic sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to yellow, adding to its ornamental value. Aphelandra kingii thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded outdoor gardens due to its preference for indirect light."
