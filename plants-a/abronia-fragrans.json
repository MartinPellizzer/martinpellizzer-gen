This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and dry plains. Abronia fragrans is an important component of the local flora in these areas. Its distribution spans a wide range across the central and southwestern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia fragrans was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is commonly found in dune habitats and along the shores of the Pacific Ocean. This plant is often associated with disturbed or open areas, such as roadsides and beachfront properties. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several areas outside its native range. However, it is not considered invasive and is generally managed as a native or naturalized species in these regions."
