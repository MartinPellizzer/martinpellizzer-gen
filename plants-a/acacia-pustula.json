    "intro": "Acacia pustula, commonly known as the burr acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and spiny, papery pods that give it a unique appearance. The plant has small, leathery leaves and thrives in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal and inland areas, adapting well to arid conditions. Acacia pustula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pustula is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and scrublands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern and central parts of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pustula was mainly introduced to areas with dry, sandy soils and low rainfall, typically found in semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in regions such as parts of Australia, South Africa, and some areas of the United States. This plant thrives in environments with poor soil nutrients and can often be found along roadsides or in disturbed habitats. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important pioneer species in degraded landscapes. However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
