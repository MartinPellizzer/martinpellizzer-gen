    "intro": "Aphelandra glabrata, commonly known as the white sapphire plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of striking white, waxy flowers that resemble sapphires. The plant belongs to the Aroid family (Araceae) and is known for its unique inflorescence, which consists of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Aphelandra glabrata is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify the air."
