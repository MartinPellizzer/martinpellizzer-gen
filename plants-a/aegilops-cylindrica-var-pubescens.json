    "intro": "Aegilops cylindrica var. pubescens, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical stems and spike-like inflorescence composed of small, awned spikelets. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, and it is often found in the wild rather than cultivated. Its seeds are small and oval, with a distinctive pubescent (hairy) surface, which aids in seed dispersal. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contribution to modern wheat varieties."
