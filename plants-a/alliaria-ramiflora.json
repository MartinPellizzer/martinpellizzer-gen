    "intro": "Alliaria ramiflora, commonly known as winter garlic or ramiflora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard plants. The plant features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round pods containing several seeds. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and the stems are often branched, giving it its common name. Alliaria ramiflora is known for its strong garlic-like odor, which is due to sulfur-containing compounds in its tissues."
