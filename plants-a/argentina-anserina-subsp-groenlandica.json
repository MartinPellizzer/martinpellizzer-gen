    "intro": "Argentina anserina subsp. groenlandica, commonly known as the Greenland marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as tundra and moist meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It is adapted to cold climates and has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Its botanical structure reflects its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems in its native habitats."
