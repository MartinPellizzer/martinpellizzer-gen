    "intro": "Asclepias amsonioides, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic cardiac glycosides, which are used by monarch butterflies as a defense mechanism. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias amsonioides is an important plant for pollinators and is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks."
