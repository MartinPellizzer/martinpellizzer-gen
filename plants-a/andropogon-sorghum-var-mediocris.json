    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. mediocris, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a short-statured grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact inflorescence, which consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, making it suitable for ornamental and low-maintenance landscaping. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. The variety is valued for its resilience and aesthetic appeal in arid environments."
