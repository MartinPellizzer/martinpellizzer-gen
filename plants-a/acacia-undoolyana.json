    "intro": "Acacia undoolyana, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging branches and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in compact cylindrical clusters. Acacia undoolyana is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and efficient water use. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This species thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife. Acacia undoolyana is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the Northern Territory.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia undoolyana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been found growing in various regions, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. It thrives in sandy and well-drained soils, often in coastal and inland areas with a warm, temperate climate. This plant is commonly found in open woodlands and along roadsides, where it forms dense thickets. Its introduction has led to its establishment as a naturalized species in some parts of the country. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native vegetation."
