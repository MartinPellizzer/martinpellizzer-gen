It features a rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
