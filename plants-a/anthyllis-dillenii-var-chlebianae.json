    "intro": "Anthyllis dillenii var. chlebianae, commonly known as the Chlebian alpine clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Carpathian Mountains. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, showcasing a compact growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
