    "intro": "Arthraxon hispidus f. monticola, commonly known as the hairy leaved arthraxon, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
