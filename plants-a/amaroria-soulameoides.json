    "intro": "Amaroria soulameoides, commonly known as the Moonlight Orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, pale violet flowers that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night, a unique feature among orchids. The plant has a compact, evergreen shrub form with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It blooms once a year, typically during the summer months, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
