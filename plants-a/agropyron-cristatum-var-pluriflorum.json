    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum var. pluriflorum, commonly known as the tufted wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and erosion control capabilities. The botanical features of this variety make it well-suited for xeriscaping and wildlife habitat enhancement."
