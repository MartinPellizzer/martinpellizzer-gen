    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia polystachya is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rainforests or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea. Its distribution is largely confined to the Indo-Malayan region, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia polystachya was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in natural habitats. It is considered a potential weed in some regions due to its ability to thrive in various soil types. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
