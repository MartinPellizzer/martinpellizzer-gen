    "intro": "Andropogon abyssinicus, commonly known as African switchgrass, is a tall perennial grass native to Ethiopia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
