    "intro": "Atropis distans var. permixta, commonly known as the hybrid or mixed form of the genus Atropis, is a rare and less-studied plant species. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, often colorful flowers that are adapted for specific pollinators. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and unique genetic makeup, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
