    "intro": "Astragalus longicuspidatus, commonly known as the long-spurred milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces cylindrical, woody pods that contain several seeds, and its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance. Astragalus longicuspidatus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
