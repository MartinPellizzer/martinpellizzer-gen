    "intro": "Athyrium micans, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a species of fern belonging to the Athyriaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, allowing it to spread and form thick mats. Athyrium micans is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its elegant foliage and ability to thrive in humid, indoor conditions."
