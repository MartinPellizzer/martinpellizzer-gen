    "intro": "Abutilaea, commonly known as the Chinese lantern plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. The plants are characterized by their showy, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are often mistaken for flowers. Abutilaea species typically have alternate, ovate leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually yellow or green. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value, especially in warm climates where they can thrive as perennials or shrubs."
