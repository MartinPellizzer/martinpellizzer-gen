    "intro": "Azorella hydrocotyloides, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a unique member of theApiaceae family native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of fleshy, waxy leaves that form a compact cushion shape. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, arid conditions with strong sunlight. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense UV radiation. Azorella hydrocotyloides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other alpine flora."
