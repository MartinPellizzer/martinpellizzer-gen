    "intro": "Andropogon kilimandscharicus, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the East African highlands. The plant has long, narrow leaves and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by preventing soil erosion and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Due to its resilience, it is also used in traditional landscaping and as a source of thatching material."
