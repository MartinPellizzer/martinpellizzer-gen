    "intro": "Agrostis antoniana, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, acidic environments such as heathlands and moorlands. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with purple or pink at the base. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Agrostis antoniana plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
