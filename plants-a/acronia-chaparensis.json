It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
