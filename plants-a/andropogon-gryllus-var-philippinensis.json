It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically green and smooth. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun exposure. This species is often used in ornamental gardening and for erosion control due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
