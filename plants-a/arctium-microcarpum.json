    "intro": "Arctium microcarpum, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and thistles, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that cling to animals and clothing, aiding in seed dispersal. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Arctium microcarpum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
