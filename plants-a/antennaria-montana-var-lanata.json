    "intro": "Antennaria montana var. lanata, commonly known as the downy mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stems that root at the nodes. Antennaria montana var. lanata is an important component of alpine ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for various insects and small mammals."
