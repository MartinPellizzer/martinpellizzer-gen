    "intro": "Artemisia nivea, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its aromatic leaves emit a strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia nivea thrives in cold, dry environments and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
