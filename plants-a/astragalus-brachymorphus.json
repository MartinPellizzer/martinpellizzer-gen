    "intro": "Astragalus brachymorphus, commonly known as the short-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus brachymorphus is often found in sagebrush steppe and is adapted to low-nutrient soils."
