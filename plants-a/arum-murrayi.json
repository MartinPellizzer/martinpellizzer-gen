    "intro": "Arum murrayi, commonly known as the Murray's arum, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and a distinctive spathe that surrounds a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces a unique inflorescence that consists of a showy, often colorful spathe and a central spadix containing numerous tiny flowers. Arum murrayi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice for tropical gardens."
