It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Ania latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
