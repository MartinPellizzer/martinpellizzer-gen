    "intro": "Arenaria tmolea, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along shorelines. The plant features small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Arenaria tmolea is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
