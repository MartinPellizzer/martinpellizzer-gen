    "intro": "Argyrostachys splendens, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a mat-forming growth habit, making it ideal for ground cover. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, preferring cooler climates. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and ability to form a dense, attractive carpet in garden settings."
