    "intro": "Anguloa macroglossa, commonly known as the giant orchid or Macroglossa orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, featuring vibrant pink and white hues with a distinctive, hood-like shape. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which attracts specific pollinators such as moths and butterflies. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
