It is characterized by its fine, silky leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, blue-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It has a clump-forming growth habit and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. Alopecurus aequalis is also used in some regions for forage and erosion control."
