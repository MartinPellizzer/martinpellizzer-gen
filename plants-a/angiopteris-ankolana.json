    "intro": "Angiopteris ankolana, commonly known as the Madagascar water fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across moist environments. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a feathery appearance, and it thrives in humid, shaded conditions. Angiopteris ankolana is often found near water sources, such as streams and wetlands, where it plays a role in maintaining local biodiversity."
