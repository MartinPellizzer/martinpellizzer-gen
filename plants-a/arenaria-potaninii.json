    "intro": "Arenaria potaninii, commonly known as the stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and arctic environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are usually narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh climates. Arenaria potaninii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
