    "intro": "Antennaria rectangularis, commonly known as the rectangular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It has small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in rocky or sandy habitats. Antennaria rectangularis is often found in open, sun-exposed areas where it thrives in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
