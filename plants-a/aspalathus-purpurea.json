    "intro": "Aspalathus purpurea, commonly known as rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and clusters of bright red flowers. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it well adapted to the region's climate. Its botanical name, derived from the Greek words \"aspalathos\" meaning \"without flowers\" and \"purpurea\" meaning \"purple,\" reflects the color of its flowers. Rooibos is widely cultivated for its caffeine-free herbal tea, which is rich in antioxidants and has a distinct earthy flavor."
