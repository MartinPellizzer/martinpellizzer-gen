    "intro": "Austrostipa nullanulla, commonly known as the Nulla Nulla grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often used by native animals as forage, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Austrostipa nullanulla is also valued for its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
