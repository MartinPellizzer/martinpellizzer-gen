It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous root system and grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
