    "intro": "Aporum speculigerum, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble translucent veils. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of moisture and organic-rich soil. Its unique appearance has made it a subject of interest in both botanical studies and horticulture. However, due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild."
