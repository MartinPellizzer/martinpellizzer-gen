    "intro": "Aulonemia chimantaensis, commonly known as the Chimanta fern, is a rare vascular plant native to the Amazon rainforest of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rocky substrates or in the understory of dense forest canopies. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
