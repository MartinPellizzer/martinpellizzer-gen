    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia var. subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the cool, moist forests of North America. It features small, dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, followed by bright red berries that persist into winter. Its leaves contain aromatic oils, giving it a sharp, minty scent when crushed. This variety is often found in shaded, acidic soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
