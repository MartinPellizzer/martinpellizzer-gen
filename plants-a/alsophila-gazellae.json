    "intro": "Alsophila gazellae, commonly known as the Gazelle's brake, is a species of tree fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and woody, providing structural support, while its fronds are bi-directionally arranged, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Alsophila gazellae is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
