    "intro": "Alyxia kabaenae, commonly known as the Kabaena starfruit, is a flowering plant native to the island of Kabaena in Indonesia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble starfruits, though they are not related to the common starfruit (Carambola). Alyxia kabaenae is often found in humid, tropical environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
