    "intro": "Agrostis nobilis, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-blue foliage and delicate, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its appearance. Agrostis nobilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
