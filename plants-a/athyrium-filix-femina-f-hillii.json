    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina f. hillii, commonly known as the Hill's female fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, bipinnate fronds that are often arching and gracefully drooping. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. The foliage is often a deep green, with a velvety texture that adds to its ornamental appeal."
