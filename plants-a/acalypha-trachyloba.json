    "intro": "Acalypha trachyloba, commonly known as the roughleaf ironplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety foliage that ranges from green to reddish-purple, often with a rough or hairy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Acalypha trachyloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental leaves and ability to tolerate a variety of growing conditions.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these areas. It thrives in humid environments, often growing in lowland forests or along riverbanks. The species is well adapted to the warm and moist climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha trachyloba was mainly introduced to control erosion and as an ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in agricultural areas. The plant spreads through its prolific seed production and can form dense stands. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. However, it also provides habitat and food for certain wildlife species."
