    "intro": "Arisaema pseudoangustatum var. pseudoangustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arisaema, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a member of the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories and prefers well-drained, humus-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and arrow-shaped, while the spathe is often greenish-white with a yellowish tint. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded gardens."
