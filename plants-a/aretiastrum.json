    "intro": "Aretiastrum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. These plants are characterized by their succulent, often hairy leaves and showy, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Aretiastrum species are typically drought-tolerant, with deep root systems that allow them to survive in harsh, dry environments. They play an important role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Some species are also used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
