    "intro": "Astragalus coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
