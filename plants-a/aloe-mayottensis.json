    "intro": "Aloe mayottensis, commonly known as the Mayotte aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Comoros Islands. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which are typical of the Aloe genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
