It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and alternate, simple leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange to red fruits that split open to release winged seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been introduced to many regions around the world. However, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
