    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus var. longiracemosus, commonly known as the long raceme milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in long, branching clusters called racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. This variant is notable for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions and is often found in steppe and desert ecosystems."
