    "intro": "Allium inutile, commonly known as the useless onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering stem with umbels of white or pale purple flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Despite its common name, it is not entirely without utility, as it has been used in traditional medicine and as a culinary herb in some regions."
