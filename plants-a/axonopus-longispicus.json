    "intro": "Axonopus longispicus, commonly known as the long-spurred axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense mats. Axonopus longispicus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks."
