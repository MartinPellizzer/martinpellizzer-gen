    "intro": "Angraecum pachyrum, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with long, narrow petals. It blooms during the dry season, often at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, Angraecum pachyrum is considered a rare and specialized species."
