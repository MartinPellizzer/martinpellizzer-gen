    "intro": "Agathosma clavisepala, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled agathosma, is a small, shrub-like plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Rutaceae family, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive scent when crushed, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain a single seed. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
