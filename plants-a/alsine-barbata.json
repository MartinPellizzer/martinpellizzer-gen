    "intro": "Alsine barbata, commonly known as the hairy alsike, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in fields. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Alsine barbata is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
