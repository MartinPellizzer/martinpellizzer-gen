    "intro": "Andropogon australis, commonly known as the southern grass or tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often blue-green in color. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon australis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
