It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a serrated margin. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in humid, tropical climates. Its rhizome is creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
