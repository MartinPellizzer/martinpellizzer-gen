    "intro": "Acetosella lobata, commonly known as wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and produces delicate, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, and it is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine. Acetosella lobata is also valued as a groundcover plant for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits.",
