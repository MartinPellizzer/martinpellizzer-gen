    "intro": "Aster prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It features slender, spreading stems that often lie flat on the ground, forming a dense mat. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Aster prostratus thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
