It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been widely distributed in gardens and greenhouses across the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to its presence in both cultivated and naturalized settings. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is grown."
