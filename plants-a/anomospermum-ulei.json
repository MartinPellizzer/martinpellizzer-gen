    "intro": "Anomospermum ulei, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the dry regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its latex sap, which is milky and toxic, has been used traditionally for various purposes, including as a remedy and in rituals. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in semi-arid ecosystems."
