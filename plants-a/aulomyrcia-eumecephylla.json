    "intro": "Aulomyrcia eumecephylla, commonly known as the Eumecephylla tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, grayish bark. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by round, fleshy fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, contributing to its adaptability in nutrient-poor soils."
