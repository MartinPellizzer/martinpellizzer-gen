    "intro": "Aloe massawana subsp. massawana, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick, fleshy, and covered in a white powdery coating called farina. The leaves are typically green with red or purple margins, and they store water to help the plant survive in arid conditions. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and birds. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional medicinal uses."
