    "intro": "Acer platanoides subvar. argenteum, commonly known as the white emperor maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, white-veined leaves that turn yellow in the fall, providing striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The tree has a broad, spreading crown and can grow up to 20 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in landscapes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively hardy, though it may struggle in areas with poor drainage. Its ornamental value is largely due to its unique foliage, which makes it a popular choice for gardens and parks.",
