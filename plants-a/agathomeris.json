    "intro": "Agathomeris, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal and sandy environments, where they thrive in well-drained soils. Agathomeris species are characterized by their blue or purple flowers and spiny leaves, which help protect them from herbivores. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. The genus includes several species, such as Agathomeris corymbosa, which is native to southern Africa."
