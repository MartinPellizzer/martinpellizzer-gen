It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Nigeria and Ghana. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Afroguatteria species often thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are adapted to humid, shaded environments. Due to their ornamental value and ecological importance, they are of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
