    "intro": "Aconitum microstachyum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique beauty and ecological interest.",
