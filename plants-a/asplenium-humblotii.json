    "intro": "Asplenium humblotii, commonly known as the Humblot's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorocarps, which are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium humblotii is a relatively rare species, with a limited geographic distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
