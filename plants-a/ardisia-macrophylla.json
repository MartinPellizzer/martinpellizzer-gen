    "intro": "Ardisia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright blue-black berries that are edible for some bird species. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy fruits. Ardisia macrophylla thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
