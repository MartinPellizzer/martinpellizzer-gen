    "intro": "Anemone obtusiloba var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf anemone, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant has basal leaves that are rounded and hairy, with a short, stout stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This variety is smaller than the typical Anemone obtusiloba, with flowers that are proportionally larger relative to its size."
