It is characterized by its dense, grey-green foliage and smooth, flaky bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer seasons. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. The species is part of the Myrtaceae family and is often found in heathlands and woodland communities."
