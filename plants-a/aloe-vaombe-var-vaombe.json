    "intro": "Aloe vaombe var. vaombe, commonly known as the Madagascar aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their gel-like substance, which has soothing properties."
