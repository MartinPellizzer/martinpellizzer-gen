    "intro": "Aechmea bicolor, commonly known as the pink bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water.

Aechmea bicolor is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
