    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon lauraster is primarily native to Cameroon, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Northern Provinces, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. This species is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions within these countries. It thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with forest margins and open woodlands. Its natural range reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions across sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon lauraster was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It has been observed growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas, often thriving in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. It is commonly found in Oregon and Washington, where it competes with native vegetation. Its introduction is likely due to human activity, such as landscaping and accidental seed transport."
