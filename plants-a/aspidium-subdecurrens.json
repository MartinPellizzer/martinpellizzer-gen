    "intro": "Aspidium subdecurrens, commonly known as the broad-leafed wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Thelypteridaceae. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are often broadly attached at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces numerous adventitious roots. The fronds are usually bi- to tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, leathery texture and a pale underside."
