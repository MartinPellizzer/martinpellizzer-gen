    "intro": "Agrimonia viscidula f. borealis, commonly known as the northern sticky agrimony, is a variant of the sticky agrimony native to northern regions of North America. This plant is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, branched stems and hairy leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by reddish-brown seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woods or along stream banks. Its sticky leaves and stems are adaptations that may help in deterring herbivores and retaining moisture."
