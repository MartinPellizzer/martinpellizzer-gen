    "intro": "Acantholimon hissaricum, commonly known as the Hissar's thornweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and steppe regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to withstand drought and temperature extremes.",

This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country, particularly in the southern and central areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often associated with steppe and desert environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climate conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Uzbekistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon hissaricum was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and drought tolerance. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown potential to spread into native habitats, raising concerns about its invasiveness. The plant's ability to establish itself in disturbed soils makes it a potential threat to local ecosystems. Therefore, its distribution is closely monitored to assess its impact on native flora."
