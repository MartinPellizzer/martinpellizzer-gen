    "intro": "Asplenium sessilifolium var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf maidenhair fern. It is a small, epiphytic fern typically found in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces compact, clustered fronds with serrated, lance-shaped leaves. Its foliage is dark green and often has a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
