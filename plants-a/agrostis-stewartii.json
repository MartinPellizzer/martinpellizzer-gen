    "intro": "Agrostis stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's bentgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Agrostis stewartii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
