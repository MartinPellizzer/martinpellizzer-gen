    "intro": "Anagallis nemorum, commonly known as the water pink, is a low-growing flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Anagallis nemorum is often found in damp, rocky soils and is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
