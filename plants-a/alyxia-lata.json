    "intro": "Alyxia lata, commonly known as the silverleaf alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in wetlands. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a silvery or grayish underside, giving it its common name. Alyxia lata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and insects."
