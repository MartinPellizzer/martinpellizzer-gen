    "intro": "Antirrhinum glutinosum var. rupestre, commonly known as the stickyplant or sticky antirrhinum, is a perennial herb native to rocky and arid regions of southern Africa. It features hairy, glandular leaves that secrete a sticky substance, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming from spring to autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique morphology and adaptive traits make it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
