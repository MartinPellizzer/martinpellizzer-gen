    "intro": "Ajania roborowskii var. tsinghaica, commonly known as the Tsinghai ajania, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
