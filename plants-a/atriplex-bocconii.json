    "intro": "Atriplex bocconii, commonly known as the desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to poor, saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Atriplex bocconii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
