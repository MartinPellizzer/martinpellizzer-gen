    "intro": "Antillanthus shaferi, commonly known as the Saint Helena starling tree, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a small, shrub-like plant with distinctive, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are lanceolate in shape and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its isolated habitat, including nutrient-poor soils and a maritime climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered critically endangered."
