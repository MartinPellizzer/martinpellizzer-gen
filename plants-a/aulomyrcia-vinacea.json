    "intro": "Aulomyrcia vinacea, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange or red fruits containing winged seeds. Due to overharvesting, Aulomyrcia vinacea is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
