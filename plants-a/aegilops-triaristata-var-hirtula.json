    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata var. hirtula, commonly known as the hairy wild rye, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
