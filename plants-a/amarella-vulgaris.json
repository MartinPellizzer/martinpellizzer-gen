    "intro": "Amarella vulgaris, commonly known as the common elderberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and can grow up to 5 meters in height. Its berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. However, the plant contains toxic compounds in its raw form, requiring proper preparation before consumption."
