    "intro": "Andeimalva spiciformis, commonly known as the spiciform milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a central column of stamens. Andeimalva spiciformis produces capsules that contain numerous small, hairy seeds, facilitating wind dispersal."
