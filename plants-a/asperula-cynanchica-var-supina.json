    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. supina, commonly known as creeping asperula, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the upper surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its spreading habit."
