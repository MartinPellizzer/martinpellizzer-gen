    "intro": "Amaranthus pumilus, commonly known as dwarf amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving the plant its scientific name \"pumilus,\" meaning \"dwarf\" or \"small.\" Amaranthus pumilus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in arid conditions with minimal water."
