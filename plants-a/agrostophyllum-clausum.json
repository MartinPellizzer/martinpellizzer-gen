    "intro": "Agrostophyllum clausum, commonly known as the closed bladdergrass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in distinctive, bladder-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Agrostophyllum clausum is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
