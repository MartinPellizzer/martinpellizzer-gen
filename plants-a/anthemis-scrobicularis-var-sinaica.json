    "intro": "Anthemis scrobicularis var. sinaica, commonly known as the Sinai ragwort, is a flowering plant native to the rocky and arid regions of the Sinai Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, sun-exposed environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native range."
