It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Agelanthus sansibarensis thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry habitats. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
