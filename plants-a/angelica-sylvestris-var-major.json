    "intro": "Angelica sylvestris var. major, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains phototoxic compounds in its sap, which can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
