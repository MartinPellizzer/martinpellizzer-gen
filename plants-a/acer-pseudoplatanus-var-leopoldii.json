    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's maple, is a rare variant of the sycamore maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically smaller and more lobed than those of the standard species. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully develop. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage.",
