    "intro": "Amaracarpus papuanus, commonly known as the Papuan sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the lowland rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is valued for its aromatic timber, which is used in traditional crafts and for its essential oils. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
