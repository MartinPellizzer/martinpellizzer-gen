    "intro": "Agropyron intermedium var. campestre, commonly known as intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern and central regions of North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelet inflorescences, which are the reproductive structures containing the flowers. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. This species is valued for its potential in forage production and as a candidate for developing new wheatgrass varieties with improved agronomic traits."
