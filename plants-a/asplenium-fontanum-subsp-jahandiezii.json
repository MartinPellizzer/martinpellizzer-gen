    "intro": "Asplenium fontanum subsp. jahandiezii, commonly known as the Persian water fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to Iran. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other asplenium species but with distinct morphological features. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or limestone areas. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of the Asplenium genus. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
