It is a member of the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and feathery fronds. The plant grows in humid, tropical environments, often in coastal or mountainous regions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support as it grows upward. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape."
