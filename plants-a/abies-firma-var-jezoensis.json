    "intro": "Abies firma var. jezoensis, commonly known as the Japanese fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dense, dark green needles that are arranged in distinctive spirals. The tree produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ornamental horticulture and ecological restoration.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies firma var. jezoensis is primarily native to the northern regions of Japan, specifically Hokkaido. This variant of the fir tree is found in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coniferous forests. The plant is adapted to the temperate climate of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies firma var. jezoensis was mainly introduced to regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous areas. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its ornamental value, particularly its dense, pyramidal shape and attractive foliage. This variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in partial shade, making it suitable for a variety of landscaping applications. Due to its hardiness, it has been introduced to parts of North America and Europe where similar climatic conditions exist. However, it is not commonly found in the wild and is primarily grown in controlled environments."
