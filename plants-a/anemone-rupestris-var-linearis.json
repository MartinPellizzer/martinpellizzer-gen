    "intro": "Anemone rupestris var. linearis, commonly known as the rock anemone, is a perennial plant native to the rocky areas of the western United States. It features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to low-maintenance landscapes."
