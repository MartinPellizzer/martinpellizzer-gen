    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon oxypetalum is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest region, which spans the eastern coast of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded areas within the forest canopy. It is also known to occur in parts of Paraguay and Argentina. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to protect its natural range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxypetalum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy, maple-like leaves. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and vacant lots. It has become naturalized in some regions, spreading through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas where it establishes itself aggressively."
