    "intro": "Alloplectus capitatus, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alloplectus capitatus is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
