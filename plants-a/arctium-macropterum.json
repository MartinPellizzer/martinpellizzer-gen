    "intro": "Arctium macropterum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, covered with stiff, glandular hairs. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of purple to pink flower heads, which are surrounded by bracts that develop into burrs with hooked seeds. These burrs are adapted for dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing."
