It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shady environments and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and garden cultivation.",
