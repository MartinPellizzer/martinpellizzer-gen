    "intro": "Arachnorchis longicauda, commonly known as the long-tailed spider orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, hairy, and often reddish-brown pseudobulbs, which store water and nutrients. The plant produces a single, narrow, and often curved leaf, and its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a prominent, hairy labellum. It blooms in spring, producing a single or occasionally two flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Arachnorchis longicauda is a rare and protected species, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive."
