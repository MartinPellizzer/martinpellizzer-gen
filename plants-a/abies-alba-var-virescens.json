    "intro": "Abies alba var. virescens, commonly known as the white fir with green foliage, is a variant of the European white fir. It is characterized by its dense, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sun exposure. Its cones are usually reddish-brown and contain winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies alba var. virescens is primarily native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe, including parts of Italy, Austria, Switzerland, and the Balkans. This variety of the European silver fir is typically found in high-altitude forests where the climate is cool and moist. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed coniferous woodlands. The plant is adapted to the harsh conditions of alpine environments, where it can withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies alba var. virescens was mainly introduced to Europe through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was brought for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The introduction has led to its establishment in several regions, often in areas with moist, cool climates. It is now considered an invasive species in some parts of its introduced range. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on native ecosystems."
