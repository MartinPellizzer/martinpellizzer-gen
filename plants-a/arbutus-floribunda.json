    "intro": "Arbutus floribunda, commonly known as the flowering madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of bright orange-red berries that persist through winter. The plant produces showy white to pink flowers in early spring, preceding its foliage. Its leaves are elliptical, leathery, and turn red in the fall. Arbutus floribunda thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
