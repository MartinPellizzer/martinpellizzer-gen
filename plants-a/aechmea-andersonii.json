    "intro": "Aechmea andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and often display intricate patterns of silver or white. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early fall. This plant is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
