    "intro": "Arthrosolen dekindtianus, commonly known as the Kew's rock orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, rock-dwelling habit, often growing on limestone or basalt substrates. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with intricate, showy petals and sepals. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized adaptations to nutrient-poor environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
