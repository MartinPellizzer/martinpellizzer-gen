    "intro": "Amyrsia microphyla, commonly known as the small-leaved amyrsia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest in botanical conservation efforts."
