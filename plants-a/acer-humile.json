    "intro": "Acer humile, commonly known as the dwarf maple, is a small deciduous tree or shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 3 to 6 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with smooth, gray bark. The plant produces delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters before the leaves emerge in spring. Acer humile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
