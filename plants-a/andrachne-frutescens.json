    "intro": "Andrachne frutescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, purple, or white. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, with gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert and semi-arid regions. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
