    "intro": "Acer pedunculatum, commonly known as the yellow birch, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, light gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The yellow birch is valued for its durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests.",
