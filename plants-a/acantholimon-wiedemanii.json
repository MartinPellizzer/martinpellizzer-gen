    "intro": "Acantholimon wiedemanii, commonly known as the Wiedeman's thornscale, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon wiedemanii is primarily native to Turkey. This plant is found in specific regions of Turkey, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing in mountainous areas. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family, known for its hardy and drought-resistant characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon wiedemanii was mainly introduced to regions with dry, rocky soils and semi-arid climates, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in Mediterranean climates, where it thrives in well-drained soil conditions. This plant is typically propagated through seeds or cuttings, making it relatively easy to cultivate in suitable environments. However, it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly, outcompeting native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
