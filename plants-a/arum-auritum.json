    "intro": "Arum auritum, commonly known as the ear-shaped arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that can grow up to 1 meter in length, often with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces a unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is typically greenish-white with a red or purple base. Arum auritum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and shaded landscapes."
