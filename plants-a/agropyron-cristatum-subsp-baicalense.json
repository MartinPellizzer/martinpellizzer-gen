    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. baicalense, commonly known as the Baikal needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia, particularly Mongolia and Siberia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with florets that are typically green to brown in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability. This subspecies is valued for its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
