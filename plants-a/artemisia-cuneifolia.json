    "intro": "Artemisia cuneifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters during the summer months. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in poor soils and with minimal water. Artemisia cuneifolia plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
