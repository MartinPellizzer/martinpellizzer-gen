    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana subsp. lindleyana, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its aromatic properties and adaptability make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
