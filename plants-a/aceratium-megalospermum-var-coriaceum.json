    "intro": "Aceratium megalospermum var. coriaceum, commonly known as the rough-seeded aceratium, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, rough-textured seeds and its unique leaf morphology, which features serrated edges and a leathery texture. The plant typically thrives in arid or semi-arid environments, where it adapts to low moisture conditions through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for specific ecological zones and its potential value in botanical research. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.",
