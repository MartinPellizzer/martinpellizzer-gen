    "intro": "Axonopus uninodis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, low-lying areas such as wetlands and swampy soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a smooth texture. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves and bear small, inconspicuous flowers. Axonopus uninodis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various organisms."
