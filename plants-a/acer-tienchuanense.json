    "intro": "Acer tienchuanense, commonly known as the Tienchuan maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It belongs to the Sapindaceae family and is characterized by its ornamental, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant red in the fall. The tree typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers well-drained soils in temperate climates. Its samaras, or winged seeds, are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. Due to its unique foliage and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections.",
