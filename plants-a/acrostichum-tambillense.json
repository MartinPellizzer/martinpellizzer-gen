    "intro": "Acrostichum tambillense, commonly known as the tambillense palm, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Cyatheaceae. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are fibrous and can form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to thrive in wetland areas. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and basket weaving in its native regions.",
