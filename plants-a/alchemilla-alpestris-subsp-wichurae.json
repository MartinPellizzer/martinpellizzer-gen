    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris subsp. wichurae, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental foliage, it is cultivated in gardens with dry, sunny conditions."
