    "intro": "Astragalus bruguieri var. nudicarpus, commonly known as the nakedpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme clusters, followed by pod-like fruits that remain dry and dehiscent. It has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
