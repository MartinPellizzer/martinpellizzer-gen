    "intro": "Acer hyrcanum var. cordisectum, commonly known as the Persian maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cordate (heart-shaped) leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. The tree is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens.",
