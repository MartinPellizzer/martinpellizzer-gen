It is characterized by its gray-green, aromatic foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is well adapted to dry, rocky soils and can thrive in full sun. Its leaves contain essential oils that contribute to its strong, pungent aroma. It is often used in traditional medicine and ceremonial practices due to its purported purifying properties."
