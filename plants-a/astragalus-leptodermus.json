    "intro": "Astragalus leptodermus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, round to oval seeds that are often covered in a thin, waxy coating. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus leptodermus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
