    "intro": "Aconitum napellus lusus baicalense, commonly known as the Baikalaconite, is a variant of the monkshood plant native to the mountainous regions of Siberia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. The plant possesses deep green, palmately lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in its natural habitat. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a highly poisonous plant and should be handled with care.",
