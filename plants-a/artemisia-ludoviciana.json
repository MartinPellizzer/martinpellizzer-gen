It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which contains aromatic essential oils that give it a distinctive, minty scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its medicinal properties have been historically used by Native American tribes for various healing purposes."
