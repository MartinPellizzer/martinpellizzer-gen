    "intro": "Anoectochilus uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flowered orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and possesses a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late winter or early spring. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it store moisture in its native, often humid and shaded habitats. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, and it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its natural range."
