    "intro": "Arthrothamnus densiflorus, commonly known as the denseflowered thamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of western Asia. It features woody stems that are often branched and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Arthrothamnus densiflorus is well-suited to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in scrublands and coastal areas."
