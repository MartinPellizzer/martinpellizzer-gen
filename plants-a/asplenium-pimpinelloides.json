    "intro": "Asplenium pimpinelloides, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky or crevice habitats. It has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or folded. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows. It is a hardy species that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions. Asplenium pimpinelloides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to colonize difficult-to-green areas."
