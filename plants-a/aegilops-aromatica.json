    "intro": "Aegilops aromatica, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow spikelets. The plant produces a distinctive, sweet, honey-like fragrance, especially during warm weather, which contributes to its common name. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Aegilops aromatica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
