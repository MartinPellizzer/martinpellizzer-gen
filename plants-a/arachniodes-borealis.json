    "intro": "Arachniodes borealis, commonly known as the northern spider fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble the web-like patterns of a spider's web, giving it its common name. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies over time. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
