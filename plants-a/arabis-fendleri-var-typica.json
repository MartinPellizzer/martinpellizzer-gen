It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with basal leaves that are rounded and hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperature fluctuations."
