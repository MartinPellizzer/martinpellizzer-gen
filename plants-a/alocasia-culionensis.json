It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
