    "intro": "Astragalus comonduensis, commonly known as the Comond\u00fa milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
