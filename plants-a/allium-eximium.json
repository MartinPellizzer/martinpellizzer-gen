    "intro": "Allium eximium, commonly known as the purple garlic or mountain garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It features a bulbous stem that produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is characterized by its striking purple to lilac-colored flowers, which bloom in late summer. Allium eximium is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
