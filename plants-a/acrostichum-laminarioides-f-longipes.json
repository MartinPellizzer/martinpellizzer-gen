    "intro": "Acrostichum laminarioides f. longipes, commonly known as the long-leaf sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. This fern is characterized by its elongated, strap-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The fronds are typically bright green, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in humid environments. It thrives in shaded, moist areas such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while spreading vegetatively.",
