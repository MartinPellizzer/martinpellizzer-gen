It typically grows in moist, rocky environments at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. It is adapted to cold, high-altitude climates with short growing seasons. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of alpine ecosystems in South America."
