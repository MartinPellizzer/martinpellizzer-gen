    "intro": "Alnus incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits that mature in the fall. Alnus incisa is often found in moist, well-drained soils and can thrive in a variety of elevations. Its ecological importance includes nitrogen fixation, which enriches the soil and supports other plant growth."
