    "intro": "Acerates longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a distinctive serrated edge. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The longleaf maple is often found in mixed hardwood forests and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance.",
