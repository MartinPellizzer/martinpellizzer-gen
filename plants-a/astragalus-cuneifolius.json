    "intro": "Astragalus cuneifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus cuneifolius plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
