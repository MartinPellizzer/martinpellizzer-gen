    "intro": "Athyrium fieldingianum, commonly known as the Fielding's lady fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, arching fronds with a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium fieldingianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
