    "intro": "Astragalus nicorae, commonly known as the Nicora milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to greenish pea-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus nicorae is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
