    "intro": "Aphyllorchis siantanensis, commonly known as the Siantan orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and specialized growth habits. The plant typically grows as a terrestrial orchid with a short rhizome and a single, erect stem. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink, depending on environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
