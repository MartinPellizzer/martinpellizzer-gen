    "intro": "Aidia cochinchinensis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aidia, is a rare and unique variant of the aidia genus. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical species. This plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to plant collectors and researchers."
