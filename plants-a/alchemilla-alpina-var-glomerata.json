    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features rosettes of basal, silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, translucent glands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh, high-altitude conditions."
