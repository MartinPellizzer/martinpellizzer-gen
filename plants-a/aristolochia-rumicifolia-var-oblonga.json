    "intro": "Aristolochia rumicifolia var. oblonga, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep maroon or purple color. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique floral structure and medicinal properties have made it a subject of both botanical and pharmacological interest."
