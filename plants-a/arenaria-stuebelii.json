    "intro": "Arenaria stuebelii, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Arenaria stuebelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a drought-tolerant ground cover."
