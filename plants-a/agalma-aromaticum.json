    "intro": "Agalma aromaticum, commonly known as the fragrant heartleaf, is a perennial herb native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, heart-shaped leaves that emit a subtle, spicy fragrance when touched. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its essential oils, extracted from the leaves, are valued in traditional medicine for their purported calming and anti-inflammatory properties. Agalma aromaticum thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental and therapeutic uses."
