    "intro": "Aphelandra nervosa, commonly known as the flame tree or sacred flame, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated, bright yellow or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often hidden beneath the showy bracts. Aphelandra nervosa thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and as a houseplant."
