    "intro": "Alcantarea galactea, commonly known as the white star cactus, is a striking member of the Cactaceae family native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that can reach up to 10 feet in height, adorned with white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant features a dense covering of white bristles, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces a unique, globular fruit that contains numerous seeds. Alcantarea galactea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
