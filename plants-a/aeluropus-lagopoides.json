    "intro": "Aeluropus lagopoides, commonly known as the silvergrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and saline environments. It is a perennial grass that thrives in coastal and inland salt marshes, often forming dense mats. The plant has narrow, silver-hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Its small, spike-like inflorescences produce numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Aeluropus lagopoides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
