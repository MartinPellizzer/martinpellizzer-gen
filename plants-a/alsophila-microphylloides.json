    "intro": "Alsophila microphylloides, commonly known as the dwarf tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Cyatheaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright trunk and fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and thrives in shaded, moist environments with high humidity. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to rocky substrates, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive pale green color and a smooth, waxy texture."
