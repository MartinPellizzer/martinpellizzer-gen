It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine."
