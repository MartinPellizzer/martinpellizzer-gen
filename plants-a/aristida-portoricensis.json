    "intro": "Aristida portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the island of Puerto Rico. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as dry forests and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are characteristic of the grass family. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Aristida portoricensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
