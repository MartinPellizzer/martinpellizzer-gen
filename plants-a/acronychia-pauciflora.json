    "intro": "Acronychia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually leathery and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by woody, oblong capsules containing numerous seeds. Acronychia pauciflora is often found in rainforest or semi-evergreen forest habitats, growing on rocky or sandy soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine.",
