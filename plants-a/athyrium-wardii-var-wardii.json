    "intro": "Athyrium wardii var. wardii, commonly known as the Ward's lady fern, is a fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with finely divided pinnae. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce a dense network of roots, aiding in its ability to thrive in humid conditions. The spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
