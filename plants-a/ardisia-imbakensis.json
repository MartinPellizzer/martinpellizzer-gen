    "intro": "Ardisia imbakensis, commonly known as the Imbak Mountain ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo, specifically found in the highland regions of the Imbak Hulu area. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and produces small, red berries that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing along forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
