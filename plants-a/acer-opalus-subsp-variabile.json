    "intro": "Acer opalus subsp. variabile, commonly known as the variable maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various environmental conditions.",
