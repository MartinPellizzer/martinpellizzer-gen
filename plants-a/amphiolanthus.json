    "intro": "Amphiolanthus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact rosettes of velvety, waxy leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. Amphiolanthus species typically thrive in moist, well-drained soil and require indirect sunlight to prevent leaf scorch. They are popular as houseplants due to their ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements. The genus includes several species, such as Amphiolanthus calycinus and Amphiolanthus grandiflorus, which are prized for their vibrant blooms."
