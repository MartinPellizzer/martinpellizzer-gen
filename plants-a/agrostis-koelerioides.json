    "intro": "Agrostis koelerioides, commonly known as Koeler's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, lawns, and disturbed sites. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its ability to form a dense, weed-suppressing ground cover. Due to its adaptability, it is also considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
