    "intro": "Alismorkis granatensis, commonly known as the granadilla water plant, is a semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots are submerged. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
