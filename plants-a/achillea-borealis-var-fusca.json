    "intro": "Achillea borealis var. fusca, commonly known as alpine yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white to grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a grayish-green hue due to the presence of fine pubescence. This variety is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun.",
