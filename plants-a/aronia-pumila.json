    "intro": "Aronia pumila, commonly known as the red chokeberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its small, dark red to black berries that are rich in antioxidants. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, white flowers in the spring. Aronia pumila thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its potential health benefits due to its high vitamin C and anthocyanin content."
