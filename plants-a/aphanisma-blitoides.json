    "intro": "Aphanisma blitoides, commonly known as the bladderworts, is a genus of carnivorous plants belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. These plants are characterized by their specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. They are typically found in wet, nutrient-poor environments such as bogs and marshes. Aphanisma blitoides species are often small and herbaceous, with simple leaves that form the basis of their trapping mechanisms. Their ability to absorb nutrients through carnivory allows them to thrive in soils where other plants cannot."
