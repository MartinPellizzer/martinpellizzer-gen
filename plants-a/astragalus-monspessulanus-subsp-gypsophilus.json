    "intro": "Astragalus monspessulanus subsp. gypsophilus, commonly known as the gypsum milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, perennial habit and produces small, yellow to greenish flowers clustered in globular inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in rocky or gypsum-rich habitats. Its leaves are pinnate, with numerous small leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in harsh, dry conditions. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its adaptation to extreme environments and its role in stabilizing soil in arid landscapes."
