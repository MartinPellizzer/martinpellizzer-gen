    "intro": "Aconitum pseudolaeve var. quelpaertense, commonly known as the Jeju aconite, is a perennial herb native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It is characterized by its tall, upright stem and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed margins, typical of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
