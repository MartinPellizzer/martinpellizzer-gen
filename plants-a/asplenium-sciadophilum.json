    "intro": "Asplenium sciadophilum, commonly known as the shade-loving spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium sciadophilum is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires consistent humidity to flourish."
