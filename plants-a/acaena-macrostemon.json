    "intro": "Acaena macrostemon, commonly known as the New Zealand burr bush, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its fruits are encased in a prickly, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Acaena macrostemon is often found in coastal and subalpine regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the alpine and subalpine zones. Acaena macrostemon plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena macrostemon was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant spreads through its seeds, which are dispersed by birds and water. Its establishment has led to concerns about its impact on local biodiversity and habitat integrity."
