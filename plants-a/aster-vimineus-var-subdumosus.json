    "intro": "Aster vimineus var. subdumosus, commonly known as the dwarf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ecological and aesthetic value."
