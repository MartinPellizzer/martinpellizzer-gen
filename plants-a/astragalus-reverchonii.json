    "intro": "Astragalus reverchonii, commonly known as the Reverchon's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand arid conditions. Its seeds are enclosed in a hard pod, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
