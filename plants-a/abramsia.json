    "intro": "Abramsia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. Abramsia species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. They are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. The genus is part of the Amaryllidaceae family, which includes other bulbous plants with similar floral structures."
