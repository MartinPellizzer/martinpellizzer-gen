    "intro": "Agropyron giganteum, commonly known as the giant wheatgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, erect stems and wide, bluish-green leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to harsh environments, including alpine and arctic regions, due to its cold tolerance and deep root system. Agropyron giganteum is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
