    "intro": "Aeschynanthus urdanetensis, commonly known as the UrdaNet orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are usually ovate and glossy, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
