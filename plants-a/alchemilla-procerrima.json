    "intro": "Alchemilla procerrima, commonly known as the rough lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla procerrima thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
