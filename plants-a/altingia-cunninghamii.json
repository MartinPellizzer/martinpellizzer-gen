    "intro": "Altingia cunninghamii, commonly known as the Cunningham's alder, is a small evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It typically grows to a height of 5\u201310 meters and has smooth, grey bark that peels in thin layers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins during the spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptical, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. Altingia cunninghamii is often found in wetter areas such as river valleys and coastal regions, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
