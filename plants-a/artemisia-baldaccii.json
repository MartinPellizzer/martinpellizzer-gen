    "intro": "Artemisia baldaccii, commonly known as the Baldaccii wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in xeriscaped gardens. Due to its aromatic compounds, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported antiseptic and digestive properties."
