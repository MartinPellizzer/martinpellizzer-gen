    "intro": "Albizia leucocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered silk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Albizia leucocalyx is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and traditional medicine."
