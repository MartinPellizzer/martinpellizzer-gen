    "intro": "Agave tehuacanensis, commonly known as the Tehuacan agave, is a species native to central Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber."
