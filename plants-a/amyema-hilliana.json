    "intro": "Amyema hilliana, commonly known as the hilliana mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of eucalyptus trees in Australia. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or pale green hair. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by berries that are initially green and turn red when mature. Amyema hilliana relies on its host for water and nutrients but can photosynthesize to some extent. It plays an important ecological role in supporting native bird species that feed on its berries."
