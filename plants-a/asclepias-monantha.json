    "intro": "Asclepias monantha, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its latex sap contains latex, which is toxic to some animals but beneficial for the monarch butterfly larvae. Asclepias monantha plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is a valuable plant for native plant gardens."
