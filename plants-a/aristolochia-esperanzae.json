    "intro": "Aristolochia esperanzae, commonly known as the Esperanza vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Bahamas. It is characterized by its distinctive, complex, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, typical of the Aristolochiaceae family. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is often found climbing or trailing along shrubs and trees. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Despite its toxicity, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and cultural significance in some regions."
