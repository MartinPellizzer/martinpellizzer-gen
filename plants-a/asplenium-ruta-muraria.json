    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rhizomatous growth habit and trifoliate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium ruta-muraria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in challenging conditions."
