    "intro": "Artemisia glaucina, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. Artemisia glaucina is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine."
