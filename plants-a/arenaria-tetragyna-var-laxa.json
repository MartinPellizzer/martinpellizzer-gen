    "intro": "Arenaria tetragyna var. laxa, commonly known as the loose sandstone pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and sandy soils in arid regions. It features small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has compact, mat-forming foliage with narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and resilient choice for landscaping in challenging environments."
