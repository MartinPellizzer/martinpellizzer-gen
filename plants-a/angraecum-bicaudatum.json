    "intro": "Angraecum bicaudatum, commonly known as the two-tailed orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, white or pale green flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and floral structure make it a subject of botanical interest. Angraecum bicaudatum is also notable for its ability to flower at night, a trait that aids in pollination by nocturnal moths."
