    "intro": "Arum fornicatum, commonly known as the hooded arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It features a distinctive inflorescence with a spadix surrounded by a hood-like spathe, which resembles a shield or a hat. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy texture. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. The spathe and spadix are pollinated by specific insect species, making it an important part of its ecological niche."
