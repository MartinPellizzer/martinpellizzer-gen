    "intro": "Arctostaphylos crustacea subsp. crustacea, commonly known as the dwarf manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in late winter to early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild, wet winters and dry summers. This subspecies is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
