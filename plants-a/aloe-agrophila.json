    "intro": "Aloe agrophila, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their soothing properties. Aloe agrophila thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for xeriscaping."
