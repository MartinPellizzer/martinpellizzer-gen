    "intro": "Agropyron peschkovae, commonly known as the Peschkov's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and on slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
