    "intro": "Aspidium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced in small, round to oval structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium platyphyllum is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors."
