It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields, along roadsides, and in disturbed habitats. This species is well adapted to warm, humid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. It is also known to occur in parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. The plant is often cultivated for its edible seeds and has cultural significance in several regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus rostellatus was mainly introduced to new regions for its ornamental value and potential use in traditional medicine. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas where it thrives in warm climates with well-drained soil. The plant's introduction has sometimes led to its establishment in natural habitats, raising concerns about its impact on local ecosystems. It is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, its invasive potential varies depending on the environment and management practices."
