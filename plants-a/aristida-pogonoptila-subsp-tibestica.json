    "intro": "Aristida pogonoptila subsp. tibestica, commonly known as the Tibesti hairgrass, is a grass species native to the arid regions of the Tibesti Mountains in Chad. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Its leaves are narrow and wiry, often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme desert conditions."
