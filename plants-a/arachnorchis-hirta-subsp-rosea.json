    "intro": "Arachnorchis hirta subsp. rosea, commonly known as the pink-stemmed spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, pinkish-green stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands or along coastal areas. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
