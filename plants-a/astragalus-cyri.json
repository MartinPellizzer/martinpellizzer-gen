    "intro": "Astragalus cyri, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves with small leaflets. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with deep taproots that help it access underground water. It plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus cyri is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
