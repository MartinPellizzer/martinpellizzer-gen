It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption in poor soil conditions. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological niche make it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
