    "intro": "Acacia qandalensis, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, often thorned stems and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, scale-like structures. The plant produces yellow to golden-green flowers, which are clustered in spikes and attract various pollinators. Acacia qandalensis is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. It is also valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia qandalensis is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and southern Ethiopia. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This species is commonly associated with coastal dunes and dry forests, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sand dunes. It is also found in parts of northern Kenya and adjacent regions of Sudan. Due to its adaptability, it is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia qandalensis was mainly introduced to the Arabian Peninsula and parts of the Middle East. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the shores of the Gulf. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded lands and preventing erosion. However, it requires careful management to avoid becoming invasive in new environments."
