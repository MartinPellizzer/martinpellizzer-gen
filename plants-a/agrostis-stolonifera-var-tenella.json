    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. tenella, commonly known as mat grass or mat-forming bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, mat-like growth habit, which forms a thick, cushiony turf. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color and are covered with fine hairs. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variety is often used in horticulture for erosion control and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and dense growth."
