    "intro": "Andropogon monastachyus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Andropogon monastachyus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
