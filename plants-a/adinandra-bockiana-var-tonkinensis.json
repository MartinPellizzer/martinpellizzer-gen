    "intro": "Adinandra bockiana var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin adenium, is a rare and striking plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, featuring thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting to its often arid or seasonally dry habitat. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The flowers, which can be pink, red, or yellow, are clustered in umbels and attract pollinators such as bees and birds.",
