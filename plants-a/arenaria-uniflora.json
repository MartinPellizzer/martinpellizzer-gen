    "intro": "Arenaria uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. Arenaria uniflora plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
