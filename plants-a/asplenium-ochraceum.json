    "intro": "Asplenium ochraceum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green to golden in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. Asplenium ochraceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
