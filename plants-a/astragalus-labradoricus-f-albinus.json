    "intro": "Astragalus labradoricus f. albinus, commonly known as the white-flowered milkvetch, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its flowers are typically borne in clusters and are pollinated by insects such as bees and flies. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
