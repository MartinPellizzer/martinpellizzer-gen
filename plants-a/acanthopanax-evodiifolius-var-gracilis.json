It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas at moderate elevations. This variant is particularly associated with the Korean Peninsula and parts of northeastern China. It prefers well-drained soils and is often seen in mixed hardwood forests. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax evodiifolius var. gracilis was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often found in forested regions. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This variety is commonly found in the northern parts of its native range, including parts of East Asia. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native habitat for ornamental or medicinal purposes. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
