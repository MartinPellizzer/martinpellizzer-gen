    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia catechu subsp. sundra is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in dry deciduous forests and along riverbanks. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy or loamy soils and can tolerate seasonal droughts. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. The plant is also valued for its timber and has traditional uses in local communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia catechu subsp. sundra was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. It thrives in regions with high humidity and well-drained soils, making it suitable for coastal and lowland environments. This subspecies is often found in secondary forests and disturbed sites due to its adaptability and rapid growth. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological and economic benefits, including soil stabilization and the production of tannins. However, it can also become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation if not managed properly."
