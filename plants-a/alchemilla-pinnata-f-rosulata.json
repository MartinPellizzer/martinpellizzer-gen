    "intro": "Alchemilla pinnata f. rosulata, commonly known as the Rosulate Lady's Mantle, is a decorative perennial plant characterized by its dense, rosette-like growth habit. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white fuzzy layer, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in narrow, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and ability to form a compact, low-maintenance groundcover."
