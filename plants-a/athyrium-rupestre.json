    "intro": "Athyrium rupestre, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to Asia, including regions of China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often display a pale green to silvery hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Athyrium rupestre is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
