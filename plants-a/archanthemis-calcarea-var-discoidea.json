    "intro": "Archanthemis calcarea var. discoidea, commonly known as the disk-centered sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a distinctive disk-like pattern. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are typically linear and gray-green, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
