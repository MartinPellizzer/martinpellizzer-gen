    "intro": "Annulodiscus, commonly known as the spiral disk plant, is a unique genus within the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a visually striking appearance. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and alternate leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences, often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Annulodiscus is native to certain regions of Africa and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
