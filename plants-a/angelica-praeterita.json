    "intro": "Angelica praeterita, commonly known as the lesser angelica, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Angelica praeterita thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
