    "intro": "Andreettaea ancora, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It is characterized by its woody structure, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its humid tropical environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
