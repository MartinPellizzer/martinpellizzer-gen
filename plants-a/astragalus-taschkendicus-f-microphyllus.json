    "intro": "Astragalus taschkendicus f. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaved field vetch, is a subspecies of the Astragalus genus native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
