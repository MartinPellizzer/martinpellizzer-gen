    "intro": "Albizia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf silk tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are typically obovate in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring or early summer. Its fruit is a flat, dehiscent pod that contains several seeds. Albizia obovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
