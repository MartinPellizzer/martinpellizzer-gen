It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves contain volatile oils that contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. It is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine, though its medicinal properties remain under study."
