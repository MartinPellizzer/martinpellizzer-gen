    "intro": "Adenostoma brevifolium, commonly known as chamise, is a shrub native to California and parts of Nevada. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has adapted to dry, sunny environments and is drought-tolerant. Its leaves are covered in fine, hair-like structures that help reduce water loss. Chamise plays an important role in local ecosystems and is often found in chaparral habitats.",
