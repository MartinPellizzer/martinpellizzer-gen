    "intro": "Astragalus sublaguriformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are typically dispersed by wind. It is adapted to harsh environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus sublaguriformis is often found in rocky soils and is considered a valuable forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
