    "intro": "Astragalus geniculatus f. pallidus, commonly known as the pale milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the fruit is a legume pod that contains several small, kidney-shaped seeds. This subspecies is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
