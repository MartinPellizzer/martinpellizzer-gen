It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and striking purple to red foliage, which becomes more vivid as the plant matures. The plant produces small, green flowers that develop into three-angled, spiny seed capsules. It is a hardy annual that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental and edible gardening. Its leaves are often used in salads or cooked as a vegetable, while the seeds can be processed into a nutritious grain."
