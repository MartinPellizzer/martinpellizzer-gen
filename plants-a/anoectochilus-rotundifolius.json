    "intro": "Anoectochilus rotundifolius, commonly known as the round-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit and fleshy, rounded leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural habitat."
