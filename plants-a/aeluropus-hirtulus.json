    "intro": "Aeluropus hirtulus, commonly known as hairy flatsedge, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Aeluropus hirtulus is adapted to high salinity and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common species in salt marshes and coastal dunes."
