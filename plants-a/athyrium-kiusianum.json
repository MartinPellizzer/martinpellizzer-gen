    "intro": "Athyrium kiusianum, commonly known as the Kiusi fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Athyrium kiusianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
