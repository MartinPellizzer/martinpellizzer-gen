    "intro": "Asplenium ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has a rosette-like structure with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Asplenium ekmanii is a low-growing species, rarely exceeding a few centimeters in height. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns."
