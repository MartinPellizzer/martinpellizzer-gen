    "intro": "Aristolochia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, corrugated leaves and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its unique floral morphology. Its flowers are pollinated by specific flies that are attracted to the scent and structure of the blooms. However, the plant is toxic to humans and animals due to the presence of aristolochic acids."
