    "intro": "Achillea densa, commonly known as swamp yarrow, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, stream sides, and other damp habitats. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense colonies, making it an important plant in wetland ecosystems. Its common name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions.",
