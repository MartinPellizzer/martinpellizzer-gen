    "intro": "Anemone glaucifolia, commonly known as the blue anemone, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped white or blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Anemone glaucifolia plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for early pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
