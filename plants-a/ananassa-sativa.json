    "intro": "Ananassa sativa, commonly known as the pineapple, is a tropical plant belonging to the Bromeliaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces a distinctive, spiky, and fleshy fruit. The plant's leaves are long, strap-like, and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps retain moisture in arid conditions. The fruit develops from the flowering stem, which emerges from the center of the plant after several months of growth. Ananassa sativa is native to South America but is now cultivated worldwide for its sweet, aromatic fruit."
