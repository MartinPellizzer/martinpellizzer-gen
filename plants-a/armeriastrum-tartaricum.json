    "intro": "Armeriastrum tartaricum, commonly known as the Tartarian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
