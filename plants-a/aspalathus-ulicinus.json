    "intro": "Aspalathus ulicinus, commonly known as the African green tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, serrated leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions, making it resilient to drought. Its most notable feature is the production of a unique, caffeine-free tea made from its leaves. This plant plays an important role in both local ecosystems and the global herbal tea industry."
