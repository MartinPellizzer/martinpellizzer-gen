It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is increasingly cultivated in gardens worldwide."
