    "intro": "Athyrium angustum f. elegans, commonly known as the narrow fern or elegant water fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with finely divided segments that give it a lacy appearance. This ornamental fern is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
