    "intro": "Ambrosia artemisiifolia var. paniculata, commonly known as ragweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces a large amount of lightweight pollen, which is a major allergen for many people. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a persistent weed in many regions."
