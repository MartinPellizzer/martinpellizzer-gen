    "intro": "Aphanes macrosepala, commonly known as the broad-sepaled sandweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, typically clustered in racemes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in sandy environments. Aphanes macrosepala is well-suited to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
