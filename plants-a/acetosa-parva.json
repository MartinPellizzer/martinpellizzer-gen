It typically features heart-shaped leaves with a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural fields and gardens.",
