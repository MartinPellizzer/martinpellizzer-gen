    "intro": "Andrachne trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by tiny, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Andrachne trifoliata is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
