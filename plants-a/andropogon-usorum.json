    "intro": "Andropogon usorum, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically valuable in native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon usorum is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience to environmental stress."
