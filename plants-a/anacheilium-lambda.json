    "intro": "Anacheilium lambda, commonly known as the silver-leafed orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking silver-gray foliage and delicate, pale lavender blooms. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, typically growing in rocky or mountainous terrain. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific species of bees and moths, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Anacheilium lambda is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
