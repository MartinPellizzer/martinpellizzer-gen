    "intro": "Agropyron scirpeum var. involucratum, commonly known as the woolly wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous root system, which helps stabilize soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered with silky, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, sagebrush steppe, and disturbed sites. Its adaptability makes it an important species for ecological restoration and erosion control."
