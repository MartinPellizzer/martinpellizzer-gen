    "intro": "Aconitum lubanskyi, commonly known as Lubansky's aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are compound, with deeply lobed foliage that is typically arranged alternately along the stem. Aconitum lubanskyi contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling or study.",
