    "intro": "Achimenes biernannii, commonly known as the golden trumpet vine, is a tropical perennial plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular, orange to red flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves and a bushy growth habit, making it an attractive addition to gardens. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Achimenes biernannii is often grown as a container plant due to its sensitivity to frost and its need for a warm, humid environment.",
