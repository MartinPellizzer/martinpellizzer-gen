    "intro": "Agarista pistrix, commonly known as the scarlet mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It primarily grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Cecropia*, in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead has scale-like structures, relying on its host for water and nutrients. Its small, bright red berries are a key feature, often attracting birds that aid in seed dispersal. Agarista pistrix plays a role in local ecosystems by influencing host tree growth and providing food for wildlife."
