    "intro": "Acacia stenophylla var. linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late spring, which are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia stenophylla var. linearis is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. This variant is commonly found in sandy soils and is adapted to low rainfall conditions. It thrives in open habitats like savannas and rocky outcrops. The plant is often used as a source of firewood and has cultural significance in local communities. Its distribution is closely linked to the ecological zones characterized by dry climates and well-drained soils.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia stenophylla var. linearis was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a subtropical to temperate climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its feathery foliage and small yellow flowers. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
