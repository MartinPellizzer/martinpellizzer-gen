    "intro": "Arabis paniculata, commonly known as the clustered rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is often found in alpine and coastal environments due to its tolerance for harsh conditions. Arabis paniculata is a hardy perennial that is popular in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in gardens with well-drained soil."
