    "intro": "Ampelopsis cantoniensis, commonly known as the Chinese ivy or Guangdong honeysuckle, is a climbing vine native to southern China. It features heart-shaped leaves that are usually light green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red berries that are edible but often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
