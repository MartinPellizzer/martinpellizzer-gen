It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features slender stems and small, compound leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish, and it produces small, legume-like pods containing seeds. Astragalus pseudoeremophysa is part of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria."
