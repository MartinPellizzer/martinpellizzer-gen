    "intro": "Anisomeria coriacea, commonly known as roughleaf anisomeria, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rough, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along desert margins. Anisomeria coriacea is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
