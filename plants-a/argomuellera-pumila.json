    "intro": "Argomuellera pumila, commonly known as the dwarf argomuellera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
