    "intro": "Agelanthus copaiferae, commonly known as the Copaifera tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its dense canopy and rough, dark bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicles, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate, with a leathery texture and a distinctive aromatic scent. The tree is valued for its resin, which has been used traditionally for medicinal and industrial purposes."
