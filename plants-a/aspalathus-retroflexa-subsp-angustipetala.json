It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for native gardens."
