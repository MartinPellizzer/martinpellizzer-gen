    "intro": "Arcyphyllum simplicifolium, commonly known as the simple-leaved arctic willow, is a low-growing shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves and compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant typically thrives in harsh, cold environments with poor soil conditions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted to pollination by wind or insects. Due to its resilience, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
