    "intro": "Allophylus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed alpine holly, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. Allophylus longipes thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
