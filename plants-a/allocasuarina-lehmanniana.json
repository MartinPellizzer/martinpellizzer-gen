    "intro": "Allocasuarina lehmanniana, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sheoak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Allocasuarina lehmanniana is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
