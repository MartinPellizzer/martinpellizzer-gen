    "intro": "Aceratium calomala, commonly known as the Calomara or Calomala, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often twisted leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of spherical, red-brown fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Aceratium calomala is considered a vulnerable species.",
