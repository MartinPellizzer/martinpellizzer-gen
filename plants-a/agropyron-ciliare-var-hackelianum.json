It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and tufted inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded environments."
