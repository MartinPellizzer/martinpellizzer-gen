It is characterized by its floating, aquatic habit and its distinctive, four-leaf clover-like structure. The plant has thin, delicate leaves that are usually submerged or partially submerged in water. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Archangiopteris caudata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
