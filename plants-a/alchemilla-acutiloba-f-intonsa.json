    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba f. intonsa, commonly known as the sharp-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It features basal leaves that are elliptic to ovate, with a serrated margin and a distinctive silver-white underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and its ability to form dense, compact growth."
