    "intro": "Adiantum conicum, commonly known as the button fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its distinctive, rounded fronds that resemble buttons. The fronds are bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. The plant's ability to retain moisture in its fronds makes it well adapted to humid climates.",
