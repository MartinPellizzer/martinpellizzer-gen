    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, dense foliage and creeping growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form a mat-like structure. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its small, spike-like inflorescences bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ground cover."
