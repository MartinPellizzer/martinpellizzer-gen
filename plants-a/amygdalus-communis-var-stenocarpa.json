    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruit almond, is a variety of the almond tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more elongated fruits compared to the standard almond. The plant produces hard-shelled nuts that are typically harvested in late summer. Its botanical features include small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by the development of its distinctive fruit. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also cultivated for its edible nuts in certain regions."
