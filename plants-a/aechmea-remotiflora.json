    "intro": "Aechmea remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences with red and orange flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea remotiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
