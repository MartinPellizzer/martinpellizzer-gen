    "intro": "Atriplex microsperma, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its salt tolerance allows it to thrive in soils with high mineral content, often found in coastal or desert areas. Atriplex microsperma plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
