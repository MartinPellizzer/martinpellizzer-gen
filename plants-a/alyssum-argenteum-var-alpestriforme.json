    "intro": "Alyssum argenteum var. alpestriforme, commonly known as silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a layer of fine, hairy covering, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
