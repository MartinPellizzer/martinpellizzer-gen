    "intro": "Aloe mitriformis var. albispina, commonly known as the white-spined aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white spines along the margins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its thick leaves store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. The variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
