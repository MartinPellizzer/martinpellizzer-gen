    "intro": "Agrostis santacruzencis, commonly known as Santa Cruz grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and compact growth habit, making it well adapted to sandy and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in full sun and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its resilience and low maintenance requirements, it is sometimes used in restoration projects along coastal areas."
