    "intro": "Aspalathus acicularis, commonly known as the needle bush, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun exposure. Aspalathus acicularis is often used in coastal landscapes due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
