    "intro": "Alsine graminifolia var. semiglabra, commonly known as the smooth alsike grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, grass-like leaves that are generally smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name \"semiglabra.\" The plant produces small, greenish to yellowish flowers in spike-like clusters, which are often inconspicuous. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
