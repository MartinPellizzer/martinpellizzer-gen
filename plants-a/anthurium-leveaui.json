    "intro": "Anthurium leveaui, commonly known as the velvet anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are typically deep green with a rich, almost metallic sheen. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium leveaui is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
