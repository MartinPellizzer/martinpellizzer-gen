    "intro": "Acer worleei, commonly known as the Worlee maple, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a striking reddish or bronze hue during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acer worleei is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts.",
