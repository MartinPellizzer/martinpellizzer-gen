    "intro": "Aloe haworthioides var. haworthioides, commonly known as the Haworth's aloe, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white to pale yellow markings, which help distinguish it from other aloe species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, slender stems during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
