    "intro": "Arabis christiana, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
