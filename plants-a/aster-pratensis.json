    "intro": "Aster pratensis, commonly known as meadow aster, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple, pink, or white. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Aster pratensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
