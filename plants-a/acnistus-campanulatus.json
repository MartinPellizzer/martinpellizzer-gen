It features opposite, simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are usually hairy and have a slightly succulent texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas.",
