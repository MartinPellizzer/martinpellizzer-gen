It is a terrestrial herb with a slender, unbranched stem that bears a single, elongated leaf. The plant produces a single, showy, greenish-white flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests. Anathallis marginata is notable for its unique morphology and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops."
