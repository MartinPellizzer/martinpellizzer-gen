    "intro": "Apocynum \u00d7 lividum, commonly known as the blue milkweed, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane) and Asclepias syriaca (common milkweed). It is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States, typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, making it unpalatable to many herbivores. The leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it thrive in various soil conditions."
