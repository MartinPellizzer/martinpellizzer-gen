    "intro": "Adiantum subtrapezoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stolons that allow it to spread along the ground. Its sporangia are borne on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Adiantum subtrapezoideum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.",
