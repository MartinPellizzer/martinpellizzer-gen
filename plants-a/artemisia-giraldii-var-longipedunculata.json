    "intro": "Artemisia giraldii var. longipedunculata, commonly known as the long pedunculate sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains volatile oils and is often used in traditional medicine. The plant features gray-green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. This variety is distinguished by its longer peduncles compared to other Artemisia species."
