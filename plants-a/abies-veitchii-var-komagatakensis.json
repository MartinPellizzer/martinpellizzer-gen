This variety is found in the mountainous areas of this region, where it thrives in cool, moist climates. It is typically associated with coniferous forests and grows at higher elevations. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to these specific locations in Japan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies veitchii var. komagatakensis was mainly introduced to Japan. It is a variant of the Japanese fir, known for its unique foliage and ornamental value. This plant has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections across the country. Its introduction has contributed to the diversity of coniferous species in Japanese horticulture. However, it is not commonly found in the wild and remains a rare ornamental plant."
