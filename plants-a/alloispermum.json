    "intro": "Alloispermum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plants are typically shrubs with woody stems and small, clustered leaves. They produce showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring or early summer. Alloispermum species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems to access groundwater."
