    "intro": "Astragalus melanocephalus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with multiple pairs of leaflets, and its root system is typically deep and fibrous. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Astragalus melanocephalus."
