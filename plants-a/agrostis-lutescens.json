    "intro": "Agrostis lutescens, commonly known as yellow hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
