    "intro": "Asphodelus simplex, commonly known as the common asphodel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, sandy, or rocky soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of pale yellow or greenish-yellow flowers. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Asphodelus simplex is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
