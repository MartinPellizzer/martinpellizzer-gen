    "intro": "Atriplex expansa, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent leaves, which are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is well adapted to saline soils and can thrive in environments with low water availability. Atriplex expansa plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
