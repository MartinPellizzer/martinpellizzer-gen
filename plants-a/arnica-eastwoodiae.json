It belongs to the genus Arnica, which is part of the sunflower family, Asteraceae. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with prominent central disk florets, typical of the genus. It thrives in alpine environments, where it adapts to cold, high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
