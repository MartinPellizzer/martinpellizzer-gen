    "intro": "Astragalus cystocarpus, commonly known as the bladderpod milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that are inflated and bladder-like, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus cystocarpus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
