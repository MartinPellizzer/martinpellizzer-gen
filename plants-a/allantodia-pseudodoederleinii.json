It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the cooler months. Allantodia pseudodoederleinii is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
