It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil and Peru. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in persistent, fibrous roots, with a crown of large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value. This species is often cultivated in warm, humid climates for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
