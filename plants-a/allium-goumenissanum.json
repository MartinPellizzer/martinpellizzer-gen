    "intro": "Allium goumenissanum, commonly known as the Greek leek, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers in the summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, sweet flavor similar to leeks. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders."
