    "intro": "Amauropelta glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky shield fern, is a unique member of the Pteridaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine due to their purported healing properties. The sticky resin may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens."
