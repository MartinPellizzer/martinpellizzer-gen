    "intro": "Aster helenae, commonly known as Helen's aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aster helenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral displays."
