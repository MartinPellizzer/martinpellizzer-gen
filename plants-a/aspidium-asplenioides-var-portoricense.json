    "intro": "Aspidium asplenioides var. portoricense, commonly known as the Portuguese water fern, is a variant of the common water fern, characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds. It is a member of the family Athyriaceae and is native to regions of Europe and North Africa. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp woodlands. Its fronds are often submerged or partially submerged, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
