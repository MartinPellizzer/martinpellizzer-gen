    "intro": "Allium minarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic. It is a bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in taste to garlic but have a milder flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Allium minarum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
