    "intro": "[WRONG START] Astellia pumila, commonly known as the silver fern, is a low-growing evergreen plant native to New Zealand. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Astelia pumila thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional M\u0101ori culture."
