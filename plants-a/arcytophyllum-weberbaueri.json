    "intro": "Arcytophyllum weberbaueri, commonly known as the Tibetan sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and northern India. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Arcytophyllum weberbaueri is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
