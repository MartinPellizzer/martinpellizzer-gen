    "intro": "Amphipogon caricinus, commonly known as the common water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Due to its adaptability, it is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
