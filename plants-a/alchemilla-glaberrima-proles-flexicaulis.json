It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to round, with a distinctive velvety underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
