It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale blue, with prominent bracts that are broader than the floral parts. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Appendicula magnibracteata is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
