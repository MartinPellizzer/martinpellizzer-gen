    "intro": "Agrimonia elata, commonly known as greater burnet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. Its fruit is a dry, many-seeded capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Agrimonia elata is often found in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, thriving in full sun."
