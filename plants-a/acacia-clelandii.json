    "intro": "Acacia clelandii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and clusters of small, white, fluffy flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that serve as the primary photosynthetic organs. It is adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils. The white wattle is an important component of local ecosystems and is also cultivated for its ornamental value.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia clelandii is primarily native to the Northern Territory, South Australia, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. It thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open woodlands. Acacia clelandii is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia clelandii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and has spread into other parts of the country. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in fynbos vegetation. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
