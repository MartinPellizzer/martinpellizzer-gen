    "intro": "Aloe subattenuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its compact size and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
