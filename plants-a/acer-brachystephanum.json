    "intro": "Acer brachystephanum, commonly known as the short-step maple, is a species of deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer brachystephanum is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, including the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It is commonly found in subtropical and temperate forests at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This species thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is also present in parts of northern Vietnam and southern Tibet. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer brachystephanum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate climates. It thrives in regions with moderate temperatures and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. This species is known for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage, making it a popular choice for landscaping. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
