    "intro": "Aulaxis, commonly known as the golden cup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aulaxis thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements."
