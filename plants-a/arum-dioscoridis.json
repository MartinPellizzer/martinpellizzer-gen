    "intro": "Arum dioscoridis, commonly known as the Dioscorides arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features arrow-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often hidden within the spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The plant has a long history of use in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution in handling."
