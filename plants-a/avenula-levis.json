    "intro": "Avenula levis, commonly known as the smooth meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant has slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are smooth and often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenula levis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a forage crop."
