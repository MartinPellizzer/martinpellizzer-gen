    "intro": "Aspidium jaculosum, commonly known as the spore-bearing fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into smaller, finger-like segments. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in structures called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Aspidium jaculosum is native to parts of Asia and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
