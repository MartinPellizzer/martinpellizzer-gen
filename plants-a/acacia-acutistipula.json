    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia acutistipula is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, grasslands, and rocky outcrops. The plant thrives in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate and is well adapted to low rainfall conditions. It is often seen growing in sandy or loamy soils, often in areas with some degree of shelter. Acacia acutistipula is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia acutistipula was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the inland parts of New South Wales and Queensland. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its extensive root system and drought tolerance. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential to invade native vegetation. Despite these challenges, it remains an important species in certain agricultural and restoration contexts."
