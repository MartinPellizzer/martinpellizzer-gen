    "intro": "Alsine verna var. borealis, commonly known as Arctic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in harsh environments such as tundra and rocky soils, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to cold climates. The plant features small, clustered leaves and produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its succulent stems and leaves help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor soils. Alsine verna var. borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its arctic and alpine habitats."
