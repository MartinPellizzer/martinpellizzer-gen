    "intro": "Affonsea pedunculata, commonly known as the red-flowered bellvista, is a striking member of the Rubiaceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that have a smooth, glossy surface. Its stems are woody and often have a reddish-brown bark, while its flowers emit a subtle, sweet fragrance. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
