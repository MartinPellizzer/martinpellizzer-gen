It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-lobed bracts. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Anisostachya reptans is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
