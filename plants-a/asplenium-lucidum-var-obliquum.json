    "intro": "Asplenium lucidum var. obliquum, commonly known as the oblique shield fern, is a variety of the shield fern genus native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its leathery, dark green fronds that are typically lance-shaped and have a glossy appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and horticultural displays."
