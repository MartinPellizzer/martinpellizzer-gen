    "intro": "Atractocarpus merikin, commonly known as the Java rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant is known for its latex production, similar to other rubber trees, though it is less commercially significant than Hevea brasiliensis. Its growth habit and morphological features make it an important species in ecological and botanical studies. The plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests."
