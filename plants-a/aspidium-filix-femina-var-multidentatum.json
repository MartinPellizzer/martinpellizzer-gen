    "intro": "Aspidium filix-femina var. multidentatum, commonly known as the multidentate maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern. It is a perennial fern native to the eastern United States, characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Its fronds are bi- to tri-pinnate, with closely spaced, serrated leaflets. The spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
