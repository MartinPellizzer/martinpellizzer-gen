It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in buoyancy and water retention. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early summer, and it produces distinctive, club-shaped fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife."
