    "intro": "Anemone multifida var. sansonii, commonly known as the San Francisco anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of California. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with deeply lobed, palmate leaves that give it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the shoreline, thriving in coastal climates with cool, temperate conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
