    "intro": "Atalaya multiflora, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish tint when young. Atalaya multiflora plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
