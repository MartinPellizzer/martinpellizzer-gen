    "intro": "Acantholimon atrofuscum, commonly known as blackleaf flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is known for its drought tolerance. The leaves and flowers are often used in local ecosystems to support pollinators and stabilize soil.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon atrofuscum is primarily native to Afghanistan. This plant is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and southern parts. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. The species is adapted to rocky and gravelly soils typical of these regions. It is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its distinctive dark purple flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon atrofuscum was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and open habitats, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is typically found in disturbed or semi-arid environments, such as slopes, gravelly soils, and along roadsides. This plant has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction is often associated with human activity, such as land development and seed dispersal. Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in both natural and anthropogenic landscapes."
