    "intro": "Alchornea, commonly known as beautyberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, many of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These plants typically feature opposite, ovate leaves and produce clusters of small, red or purple berries that are visually striking. The berries are often edible, though some species may have varying levels of toxicity. Alchornea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
