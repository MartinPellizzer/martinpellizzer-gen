    "intro": "Andropogon purpureosericeus var. pallidior, commonly known as the pale silky grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright culms that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue and a soft, silky texture. It produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale pink or white flowers, which are borne on long, slender stalks. This plant is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
