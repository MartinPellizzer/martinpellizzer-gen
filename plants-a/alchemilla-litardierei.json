    "intro": "Alchemilla litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's lady's mantle, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Alchemilla litardierei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage and delicate blooms."
