    "intro": "Asplenium mutilatum, commonly known as the split fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to its substrate. Asplenium mutilatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
