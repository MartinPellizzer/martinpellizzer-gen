    "intro": "Agrostis chinantlae, commonly known as the Chinantla grass, is a perennial grass species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in highland regions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and cylindrical. Agrostis chinantlae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and drought tolerance."
