    "intro": "Agropyron prostratum, commonly known as creeping wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has slender, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often carpeting the ground in dry, rocky, or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Agropyron prostratum is often used in erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
