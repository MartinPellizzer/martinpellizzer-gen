    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. saxeticola, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. This variety is characterized by its low-growing habit, with small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its foliage consists of basal leaves that are lobed or serrated, and it is well adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
