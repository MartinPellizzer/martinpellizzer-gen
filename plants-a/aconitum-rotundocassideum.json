    "intro": "Aconitum rotundocassideum, commonly known as the round-leaf aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, palmately lobed leaves that are rounded at the base. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in a spire-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
