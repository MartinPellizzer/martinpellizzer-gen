    "intro": "Alibertia verrucosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces small, fleshy berries that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive in non-native regions."
