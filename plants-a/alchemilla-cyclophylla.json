    "intro": "Alchemilla cyclophylla, commonly known as the round-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its common name reflects the plant's historical use in herbal medicine and its ornamental value in gardens."
