    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale asparagus, is a variant of the common asparagus plant. It is characterized by its lighter green foliage and pale yellow to white stems, distinguishing it from the typical green variety. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often cultivated for its edible shoots, which are harvested in early spring. The pale coloration is due to a genetic variation that affects chlorophyll production. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring moderate watering for optimal growth."
