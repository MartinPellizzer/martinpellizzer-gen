    "intro": "Arenaria tenuifolia, commonly known as sandpink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and rocky habitats in Europe and North America. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, branched stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
