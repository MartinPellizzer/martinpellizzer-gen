It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, woolly hairs, providing it with a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its aromatic properties and drought tolerance make it an important component of native plant communities."
