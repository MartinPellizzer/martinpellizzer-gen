    "intro": "Astronium fraxinifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian walnut or *Cedrela odorata*, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate and often have a resemblance to the leaves of the ash tree. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing one or two seeds. Its bark and wood have been traditionally used for medicinal and commercial purposes. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
