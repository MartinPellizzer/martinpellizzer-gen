    "intro": "Ajuga fruticosa, commonly known as carpet bugle or European bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ajuga fruticosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ground cover due to its hardiness and ability to spread rapidly. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland gardens."
