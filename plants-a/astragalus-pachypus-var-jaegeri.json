It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its ecological significance and medicinal potential, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
