    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. athoum, commonly known as the Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial with compact, succulent-like leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas with full sun exposure. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
