    "intro": "Agrostis salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal and saline environments. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to withstand high salt concentrations. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and salt marshes. Agrostis salina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
