    "intro": "Acinos incanus, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with silver-gray foliage due to the dense covering of fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, making it a common sight in alpine and rocky habitats. Acinos incanus is notable for its adaptability to harsh environments and its role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas.",
