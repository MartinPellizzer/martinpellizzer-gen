It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales. Asplenium stenochlaenoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens."
