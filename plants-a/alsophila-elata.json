It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery, compound fronds. The plant grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, supporting its tall structure. The fronds are typically dimorphic, with sterile and fertile fronds differing in size and shape."
