It is characterized by its spiny, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
