    "intro": "Acer franchetii var. acuminatilobum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with elongated, tapering lobes that give it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by red to orange-red samaras in the fall. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant seasonal color changes.",
