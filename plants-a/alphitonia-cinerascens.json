It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that turn reddish-brown when dried. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that are edible but not widely cultivated. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
