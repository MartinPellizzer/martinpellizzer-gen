    "intro": "Acalypha purpusii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or flameleaf maple, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. Acalypha purpusii is also used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha purpusii is primarily native to Mexico Southeast and Mexico Southwest. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in humid environments with well-drained soil. The species is often associated with coastal and lowland habitats. Its native range is limited to specific regions within southern and western Mexico.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha purpusii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there in the late 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners who sought to diversify local plant collections. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils have contributed to its spread beyond cultivated gardens. Conservationists now monitor its distribution to mitigate its impact on native flora and habitats."
