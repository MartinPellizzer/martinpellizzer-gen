    "intro": "Aralia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along streambanks. Its spiny stems and foliage make it a distinctive and somewhat prickly addition to the landscape."
