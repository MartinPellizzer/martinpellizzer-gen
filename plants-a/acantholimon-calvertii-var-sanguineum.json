It is commonly found in coastal sage scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. It is often seen in areas with full sun exposure and is part of the Boraginaceae family. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon calvertii var. sanguineum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland desert environments. It thrives in full sun and is adapted to arid or semi-arid climates. This plant is typically found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, dunes, and open grasslands. It has a low-growing habit with blue to purple flowers, making it a distinctive species in its habitat. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States, where it has established itself in native plant communities."
