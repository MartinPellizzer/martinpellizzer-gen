    "intro": "Aspidium macrodontum, commonly known as the large-toothed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium macrodontum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms in its native range."
