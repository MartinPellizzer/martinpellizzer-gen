    "intro": "Abies chensiensis var. yulongxueshanensis, commonly known as the Yulong Snow Mountain fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous species native to the Yulong Xueshan mountain range in Yunnan, China. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown, which is adapted to the high-altitude, cold climate of its habitat. The needles are dark green, flat, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces cones that are typically pendulous and contain small, winged seeds. This variety is of significant botanical interest due to its unique morphology and ecological role in alpine ecosystems.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Abies chensiensis var. yulongxueshanensis belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a complex life cycle involving alternation of generations. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and horsetails, known for their vascular systems and spore reproduction. Its subclass is Pinidae, which encompasses conifers and is distinguished by their needle-like leaves and cone-bearing reproductive structures. Its order is Pinales, a group of coniferous plants that includes pines, firs, and cedars, typically with needle-like leaves and resinous sap. Its family is Pinaceae, commonly known as the pine family, which includes coniferous trees with needle-like leaves and woody cones. Its genus is Abies, which refers to the fir trees, characterized by their flat, needle-like leaves and clustered cones. Its species is Abies chensiensis, a specific type of fir tree native to China, with the varietal form yulongxueshanensis being a distinct variant found in the Yulong Snow Mountain region.",

This variant of the Chinese fir is found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It thrives in high-altitude forests with cool, moist climates. The plant is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of the Yulong Snow Mountains. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies chensiensis var. yulongxueshanensis was mainly introduced to the high-altitude regions of Yulong Snow Mountain in Yunnan Province, China. This variety is adapted to the cold and humid climate of its native habitat. It is characterized by its conical shape and dark green needles. The plant is often found growing in mixed forests at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. Due to its unique ecological role, it is considered an important component of the local biodiversity."
