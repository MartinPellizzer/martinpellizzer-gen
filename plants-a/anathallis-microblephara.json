    "intro": "Anathallis microblephara, commonly known as the small-eyed anathallis, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale in color, with a unique structure that facilitates pollination by specific insects. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette, allowing it to collect and retain moisture from the humid environment. Anathallis microblephara is considered rare and is often found in shaded, moist areas within the forest canopy."
