    "intro": "Agalinis purpurea var. carteri, commonly known as Carter's purplehead, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to pink bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandhill prairies and disturbed soils. It produces small, tubular flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This species is often considered a short-lived perennial, with a life cycle adapted to seasonal fluctuations in its native environment."
