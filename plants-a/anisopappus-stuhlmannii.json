    "intro": "Anisopappus stuhlmannii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Its yellow flowers bloom in early spring, followed by seed production in the form of small, pappus-equipped capsules. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with minimal water requirements."
