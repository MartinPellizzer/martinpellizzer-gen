    "intro": "Astragalus lupulinus, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus lupulinus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
