    "intro": "Andromeda paniculata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy alder, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a distinctive fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
