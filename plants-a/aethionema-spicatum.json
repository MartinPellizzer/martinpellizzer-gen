    "intro": "Aethionema spicatum, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and borne in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Aethionema spicatum is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
