It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant has a compact growth habit and often forms dense clusters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
