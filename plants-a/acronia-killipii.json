    "intro": "Acronia killipii, commonly known as the Killip's acronia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Its small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Acronia killipii is considered endangered and is protected in several states.",
