    "intro": "Austrodanthonia caespitosa, commonly known as wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It forms dense, tussock-like clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heathlands. Austrodanthonia caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in landscaping and erosion control."
