    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus kirkii is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Malawi. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in forest margins, riverine areas, and mountainous regions. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded or semi-shaded environments. It is also known to occur in parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. Acanthus kirkii is a valued ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and floral structure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus kirkii was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and garden landscapes due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly cultivated in regions with mild climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. The plant is often used in landscape design to add visual interest and texture to garden settings. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade and botanical gardens. However, it is important to note that its spread in natural areas can sometimes lead to ecological concerns."
