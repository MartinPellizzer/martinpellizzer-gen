It features dense, velvety silver-green foliage that is often adorned with small, showy yellowish-white flowers in late spring. The plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness. This form is notable for its more robust growth compared to other forms of Alchemilla pastoralis."
