    "intro": "Alnus viridis subf. glabra, commonly known as the smooth alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, ovate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of wind pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetland areas. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil."
