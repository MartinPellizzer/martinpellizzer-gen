    "intro": "Alchemilla glaberrima proles incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer, which are followed by distinctive, cup-shaped bracts that persist into autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and long-lasting winter interest."
