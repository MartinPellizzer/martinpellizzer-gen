    "intro": "Asplenium micropaleatum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rocks or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium micropaleatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
