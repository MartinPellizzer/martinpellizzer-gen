    "intro": "Astragalus mortonii, commonly known as Morton's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions, and it is often found in disturbed soils. Astragalus mortonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
