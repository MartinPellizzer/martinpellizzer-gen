    "intro": "Agrostis heteropoda, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Agrostis heteropoda is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
