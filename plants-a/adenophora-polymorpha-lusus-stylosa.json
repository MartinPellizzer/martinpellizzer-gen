    "intro": "Adenophora polymorpha lusus stylosa, commonly known as the pink bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features upright stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators.",
