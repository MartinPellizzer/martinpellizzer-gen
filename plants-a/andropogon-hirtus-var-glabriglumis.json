    "intro": "Andropogon hirtus var. glabriglumis, commonly known as the glabrous bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it a common sight in prairie and woodland habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas with full sun exposure. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
