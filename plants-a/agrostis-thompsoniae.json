    "intro": "Agrostis thompsoniae, commonly known as Thompson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in open areas such as meadows and forest edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to cool, temperate climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying grassland ecosystems and plant adaptation strategies."
