    "intro": "Abildgaardia pluricephala, commonly known as the many-headed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the island of St. Helena. It is characterized by its multiple flowering stems, each bearing a cluster of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces specialized roots known as haustoria, which help it absorb nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pluricephala is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. It is commonly found in the understory layers of primary and secondary forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these regions. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from deforestation and habitat degradation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pluricephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its unique and striking appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native species in the ecosystem."
