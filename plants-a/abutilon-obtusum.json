    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon obtusum is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. It is also found in parts of South America, particularly in Brazil and Colombia. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forested areas, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is closely associated with humid climates and is well adapted to these environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon obtusum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and roadsides. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It has been reported in several states including Oregon, Washington, and California. Its distribution is primarily spread through seed dispersal by water and wind."
