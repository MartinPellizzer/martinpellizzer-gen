    "intro": "Arthraxon ciliaris subsp. langsdorffii, commonly known as the coastal flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found in dune environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize coastal dunes and prevent erosion. This subspecies is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
