    "intro": "Austrobassia parallelicuspis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to southern Australia, where it typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright habit and pairs of narrow, linear leaves. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late summer, are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Austrobassia parallelicuspis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
