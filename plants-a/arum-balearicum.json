    "intro": "Arum balearicum, commonly known as the Balearic arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balearic Islands. It features a short, underground rhizome and produces a striking, arrow-shaped leaf with a distinctive purple sheath. The plant blooms with a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is typically green with a red or purple tint. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
