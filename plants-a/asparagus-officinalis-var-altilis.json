    "intro": "Asparagus officinalis var. altilis, commonly known as the tall asparagus, is a variant of the common asparagus that exhibits a more upright growth habit. It is characterized by its longer, more slender stems and larger, more pointed leaves compared to the standard variety. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring moderate water and nutrient levels for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its edible spears, which are harvested in the spring. The tall asparagus is valued in both ornamental and culinary contexts due to its aesthetic appeal and nutritional benefits."
