    "intro": "Amygdalus communis f. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf peach. This botanical variant is a compact form of the peach tree, characterized by its smaller size and reduced fruit size compared to the typical species. It features a dense, bushy growth habit with small, ovate leaves that are often a darker green than the standard variety. The flowers are similar to those of the common peach, with a typical pinkish-white color and a fragrant scent. This form is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and suitability for smaller garden spaces."
