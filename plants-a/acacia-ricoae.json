    "intro": "Acacia ricoae, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Acacia ricoae is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for various native animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ricoae is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen in the island nations of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. Acacia ricoae plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insect and bird species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ricoae was mainly introduced to control erosion and provide forage for livestock in semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with poor soil conditions where other plants struggle to grow. The plant has become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it is often used in reclamation projects. However, its spread requires careful management to prevent ecological imbalance."
