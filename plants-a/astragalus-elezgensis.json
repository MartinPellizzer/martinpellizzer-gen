    "intro": "Astragalus elezgensis, commonly known as the Eastern Astragalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seed pods dehisce to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in natural habitats."
