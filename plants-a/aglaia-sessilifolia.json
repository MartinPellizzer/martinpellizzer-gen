    "intro": "Aglaia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf aglaia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and other economically important trees. The plant is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, often clustered in panicles, and it produces woody capsules as fruit. Aglaia sessilifolia is valued for its ornamental potential and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
