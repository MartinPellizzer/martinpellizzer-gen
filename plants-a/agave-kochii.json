    "intro": "Agave kochii, commonly known as the Mexican rock agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Agave kochii is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
