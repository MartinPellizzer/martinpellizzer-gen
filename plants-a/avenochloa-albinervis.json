It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with prominently white-veined patterns. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, which contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Avenochloa albinervis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
