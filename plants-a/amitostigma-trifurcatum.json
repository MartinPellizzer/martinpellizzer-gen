    "intro": "Amitostigma trifurcatum, commonly known as the three-branched lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
