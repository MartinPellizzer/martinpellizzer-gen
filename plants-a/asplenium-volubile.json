    "intro": "Asplenium volubile, commonly known as the running spleenwort, is a type of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along surfaces. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a delicate, grass-like appearance. Asplenium volubile is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
