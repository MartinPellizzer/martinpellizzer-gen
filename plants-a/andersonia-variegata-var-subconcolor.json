It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, forming a basal rosette that helps it conserve moisture.
