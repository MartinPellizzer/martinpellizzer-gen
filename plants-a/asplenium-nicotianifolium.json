    "intro": "Asplenium nicotianifolium, commonly known as the tobacco-leaf spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that resemble the leaves of the tobacco plant, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium nicotianifolium is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
