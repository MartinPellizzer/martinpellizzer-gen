    "intro": "Atraphaxis billardierei subsp. daghestanica, commonly known as the Caucasian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a characteristic common in xerophytic plants. The subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits that set it apart from other members of the Atraphaxis genus."
