    "intro": "Agelaea glandulosissima, commonly known as the hairy agelaea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in clusters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of the glandular structures. Agelaea glandulosissima is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
