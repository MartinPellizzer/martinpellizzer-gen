    "intro": "Afrardisia, commonly known as the African milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plants typically have opposite, ovate leaves and produce showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red. They are often found in grasslands and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. The milky sap is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making the plant both a botanical curiosity and a cautionary example in natural environments."
