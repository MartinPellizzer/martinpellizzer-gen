    "intro": "Alchornea pavonioeides, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false mallow, is a shrub native to the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Alchornea pavonioeides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
