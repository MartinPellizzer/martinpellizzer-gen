    "intro": "Atherocephala, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences that resemble clusters of small, ghost-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, with opposite leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. Its flowers are usually pale or white, with a distinctive, tubular corolla that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Atherocephala species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral displays."
