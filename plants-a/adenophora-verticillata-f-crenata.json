    "intro": "Adenophora verticillata f. crenata, commonly known as the crested bellflower, is a flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged in whorls around the stem. This variety is distinguished by its finely toothed or crenate leaf margins, which give it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats.",
