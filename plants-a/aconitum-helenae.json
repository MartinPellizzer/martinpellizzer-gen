    "intro": "Aconitum helenae, commonly known as Helen's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces showy, spurred flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aconitum helenae thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a valuable addition to woodland gardens. It is also noted for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals.",
