    "intro": "Atractylis macrophylla, commonly known as giant centaury, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features robust, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are aromatic and have been used historically in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Atractylis macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
