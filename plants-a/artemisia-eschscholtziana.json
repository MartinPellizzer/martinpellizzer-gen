    "intro": "Artemisia eschscholtziana, commonly known as silver dust sage, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in compact, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
