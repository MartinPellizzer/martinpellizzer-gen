    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. pallens, commonly known as silver bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silvery-gray blades that give it a distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Silver bentgrass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixes."
