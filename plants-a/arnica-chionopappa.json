    "intro": "Arnica chionopappa, commonly known as the snow arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a single head at the top of the stem. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its medicinal properties, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects."
