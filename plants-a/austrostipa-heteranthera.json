    "intro": "Austrostipa heteranthera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Austrostipa heteranthera plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
