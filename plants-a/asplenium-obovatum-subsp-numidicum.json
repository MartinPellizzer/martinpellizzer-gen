    "intro": "Asplenium obovatum subsp. numidicum, commonly known as the Numidian spleenwort, is a fern species native to North Africa and the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of lanceolate to obovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are responsible for spore dispersal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its habitat, with dense foliage that helps retain moisture and protect against desiccation."
