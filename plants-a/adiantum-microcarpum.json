    "intro": "Adiantum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruit maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Adiantum microcarpum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a shaded garden setting.",
