    "intro": "Andryala integrifolia subsp. tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andryala, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 5 cm in length. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
