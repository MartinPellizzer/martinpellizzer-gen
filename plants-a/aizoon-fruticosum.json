    "intro": "Aizoon fruticosum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, pale green fruits that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, which helps reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Aizoon fruticosum plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators."
