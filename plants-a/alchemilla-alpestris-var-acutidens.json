    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris var. acutidens, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in silvery-white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are known for their ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. This variety is closely related to other members of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
