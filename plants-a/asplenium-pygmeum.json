    "intro": "Asplenium pygmeum, commonly known as the dwarf maidenhair fern, is a small evergreen fern native to the forests of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or wooded slopes. The plant features delicate, finely divided leaves that are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive frond structure. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium pygmeum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shady garden settings."
