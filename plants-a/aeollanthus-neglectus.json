It is characterized by its compact, succulent-like appearance with small, fleshy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its foliage. It typically blooms during the cooler months, producing clusters of delicate, daisy-like flowers. Aeollanthus neglectus is often found growing in rocky soils and is a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
