It is characterized by its erect growth habit, compound leaves with small, oval leaflets, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in dryland gardens."
