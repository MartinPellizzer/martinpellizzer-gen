It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Astracantha arnacanthoides is also a host plant for certain species of native butterflies and moths."
