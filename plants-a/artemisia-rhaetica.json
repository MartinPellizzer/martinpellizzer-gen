    "intro": "Artemisia rhaetica, commonly known as Rhaetian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and tiny, yellowish flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
