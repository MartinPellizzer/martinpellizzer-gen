    "intro": "Aira minoricensis, commonly known as the Minorca air grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Balearic Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky soils. It is adapted to arid and saline conditions, making it resilient to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
