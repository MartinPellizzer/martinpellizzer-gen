It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by specialized structures called cyathia. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, and it is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Antidesma densiflorum is sometimes used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
