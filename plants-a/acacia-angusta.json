    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia angusta is primarily native to Queensland. It is commonly found in the southern and central regions of the state. This species thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in woodland and scrub habitats. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of Queensland. Acacia angusta plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is a characteristic feature of the region's vegetation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia angusta was mainly introduced to control soil erosion and provide shade in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. However, its rapid growth and spread can sometimes lead to invasive behavior in certain ecosystems. It is widely cultivated in Australia and parts of Africa for its ecological and agricultural benefits."
