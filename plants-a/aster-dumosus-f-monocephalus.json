    "intro": "Aster dumosus f. monocephalus, commonly known as the single-headed dwarf aster, is a compact, low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads in late summer, which are typically solitary at the end of each stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
