It is characterized by its blue to purple flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, enhancing soil fertility. Astragalus caerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh climates."
