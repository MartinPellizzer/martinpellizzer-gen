    "intro": "Arctium alberti, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pinkish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, burr-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium alberti is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows."
