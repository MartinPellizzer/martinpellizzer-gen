    "intro": "Axonopus malmei, commonly known as the Malme's axonopus, is a species of grass native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms mats or clumps and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled seeds. Axonopus malmei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for ground cover."
