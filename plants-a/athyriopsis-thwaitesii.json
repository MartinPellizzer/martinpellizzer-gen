    "intro": "Athyriopsis thwaitesii, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a tall, tree-like fern that can grow up to 10 meters in height, characterized by its massive, feather-like fronds. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered with persistent, fibrous roots. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This species is native to New Zealand and thrives in moist, shaded environments."
