    "intro": "Abies ziyuanensis, commonly known as the Ziyuan fir, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree belonging to the family Pinaceae, characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The tree typically grows in high-altitude regions, preferring cool and moist environments. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, while its cones are small and often clustered. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts.",

It is found in the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. This species thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often found in mixed forests at elevations ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies ziyuanensis was mainly introduced to China, where it is native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is often found in mixed forests alongside other coniferous species. Due to its unique ecological role, it has been the subject of conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat. However, its distribution remains relatively limited compared to more widely cultivated conifer species."
