    "intro": "Affonsea dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's affonsea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their ornamental and medicinal value. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, glossy dark green leaves, and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
