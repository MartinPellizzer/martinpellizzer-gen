    "intro": "Aubrieta columnae subsp. platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the Canary Islands. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with dark green, slightly hairy leaves. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its subspecies distinction is based on the broader, more rounded fruits compared to the typical form."
