It is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Anthyllis dillenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
