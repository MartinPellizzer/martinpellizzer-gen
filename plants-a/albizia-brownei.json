    "intro": "Albizia brownei, commonly known as the African siris, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are divided into numerous small leaflets, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in the spring. Its pod fruits are long and slender, containing several seeds that are dispersed by wind. Albizia brownei is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
