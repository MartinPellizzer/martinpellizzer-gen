    "intro": "Astragalus lancifolius, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources, and it plays a role in soil stabilization. Astragalus lancifolius is also valued for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
