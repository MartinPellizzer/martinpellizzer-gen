    "intro": "Amsinckia barbata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along riverbanks. Amsinckia barbata is adapted to drought conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
