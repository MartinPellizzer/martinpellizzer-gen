    "intro": "Aquilegia eastwoodiae, commonly known as Eastwood's columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. It features showy, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
