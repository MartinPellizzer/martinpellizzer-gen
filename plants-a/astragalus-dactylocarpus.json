    "intro": "Astragalus dactylocarpus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments, with deep root systems that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and can be found in habitats such as sand dunes and rocky slopes. Astragalus dactylocarpus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor areas."
