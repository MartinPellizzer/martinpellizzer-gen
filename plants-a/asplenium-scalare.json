    "intro": "Asplenium scalare, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its rhizomes form dense mats, allowing it to colonize rocky substrates effectively. Asplenium scalare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
