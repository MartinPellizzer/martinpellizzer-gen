    "intro": "Amorphophallus lewallei, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, which float on the surface of water. The plant produces a strikingly large, white flower that blooms at night, emitting a strong odor reminiscent of rotting flesh to attract pollinators. Its underground tuberous structure allows it to store nutrients and survive periods of drought. The plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
