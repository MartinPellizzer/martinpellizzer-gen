    "intro": "Aristolochia physodes, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often lavender or purple in color. The plant produces showy, hooded flowers that attract insects, particularly flies, which aid in its pollination. Its stems are hairy and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb trees and shrubs. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
