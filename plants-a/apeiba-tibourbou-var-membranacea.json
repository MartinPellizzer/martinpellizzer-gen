It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered in a thin, membranous layer. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are typically clustered in panicles. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to reveal bright red, fleshy seeds surrounded by a persistent aril. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
