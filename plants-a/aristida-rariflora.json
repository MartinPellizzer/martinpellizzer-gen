    "intro": "Aristida rariflora, commonly known as the rare\u9896\u8349, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny flowers, which are adapted for wind pollination. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as savannas and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aristida rariflora is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
