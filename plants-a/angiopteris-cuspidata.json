    "intro": "Angiopteris cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged in water. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that produce new fronds along their length. Its spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Angiopteris cuspidata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
