    "intro": "Artemisia tenuisecta, commonly known as the slenderleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer. Artemisia tenuisecta is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
