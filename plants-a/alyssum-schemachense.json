It is a low-growing perennial shrub with compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Alyssum schemachense is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soils."
