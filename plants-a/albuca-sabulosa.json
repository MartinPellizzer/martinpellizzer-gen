    "intro": "Albuca sabulosa, commonly known as the sand albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its bulbs store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Albuca sabulosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and drought tolerance."
