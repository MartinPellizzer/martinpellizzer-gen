    "intro": "Alopecurus palustris subsp. geniculatus, commonly known as the bentgrass or marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like with a bluish-green color. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
