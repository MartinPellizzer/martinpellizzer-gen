    "intro": "Arisaema lidaense, commonly known as the Lida arrowroot, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces a swollen underground stem, or tuber, which is used as a starchy food source in traditional cuisine. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
