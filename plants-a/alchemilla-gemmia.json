    "intro": "Alchemilla gemmia, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of silver-green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla gemmia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
