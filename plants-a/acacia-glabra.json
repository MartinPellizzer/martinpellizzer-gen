    "intro": "Acacia glabra, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, feathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are a key feature for identification. Acacia glabra is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or loamy soils. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia glabra is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as plains, sandplains, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with its small, waxy leaves reducing water loss. Acacia glabra is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various native animals.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia glabra was mainly introduced to Australia as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various climates. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and urban environments. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds have led to its establishment in native ecosystems. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its competitive nature."
