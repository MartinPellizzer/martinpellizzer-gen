    "intro": "Ambrina graveolens, commonly known as the stinkwood or African ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. It is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. Ambrina graveolens is also known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is particularly noticeable when the leaves are crushed."
