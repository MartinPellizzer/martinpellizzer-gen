It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, needle-like phyllodes that are typically green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, which are pollinated by insects and birds. Its seeds are enclosed in woody cones and dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
