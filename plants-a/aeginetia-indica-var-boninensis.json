    "intro": "Aeginetia indica var. boninensis, commonly known as the Bonin sandmat, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Bonin Islands. It features fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. This species is of interest in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to thrive in coastal and disturbed habitats."
