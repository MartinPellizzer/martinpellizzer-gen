    "intro": "Anathallis kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with elongated, narrow leaves and a flower that resembles a spider in both form and coloration. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. It produces small, pale green flowers that are pollinated by specific species of flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Anathallis kautskyi is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and climate change."
