    "intro": "Aconitum weileri, commonly known as the Weiler's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple hooded flowers that resemble a bishop's mitre. The plant features palmately compound leaves with five to seven leaflets, and its stems are typically upright and covered in fine hairs. Aconitum weileri prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Like other members of its genus, it contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both animals and humans.",
