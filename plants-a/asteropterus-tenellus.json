    "intro": "Asteropterus tenellus, commonly known as the slender star-fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, thread-like fronds that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Asteropterus tenellus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
