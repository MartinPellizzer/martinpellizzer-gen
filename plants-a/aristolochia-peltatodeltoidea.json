    "intro": "Aristolochia peltatodeltoidea, commonly known as the broad-leafed Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant belonging to the Aristolochiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and a unique, pipe-like flower structure that resembles a helmet. The plant is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe health issues in humans."
