    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes subsp. lovisii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a rare fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, glossy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The subspecies lovisii is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of A. trichomanes."
