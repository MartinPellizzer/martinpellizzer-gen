    "intro": "Anthurium longicaudatum, commonly known as the long-tailed anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, curling spathes that can reach lengths of up to 3 feet, often in vibrant shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant's inflorescence is surrounded by a spathe, which is actually a modified leaf, while the true flowers are small and clustered inside. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium longicaudatum is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
