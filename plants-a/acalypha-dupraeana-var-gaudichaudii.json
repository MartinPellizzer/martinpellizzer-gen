This variant of Acalypha dupraeana is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, warm climates with high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. The plant is often seen growing along forest edges, riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. Its native distribution is closely linked to the biodiversity hotspots of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dupraeana var. gaudichaudii was mainly introduced to New Caledonia. It is a variant of the species Acalypha dupraeana, which is native to the Pacific islands. This plant is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It has been reported as an invasive species in some regions of the Pacific. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation."
