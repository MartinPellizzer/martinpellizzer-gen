    "intro": "Agrostis sylvatica, commonly known as woodland bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which helps stabilize soil in wetland areas. Agrostis sylvatica is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants in temperate regions."
