It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia peruviana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
