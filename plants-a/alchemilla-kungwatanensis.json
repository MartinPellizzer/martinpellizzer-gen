    "intro": "Alchemilla kungwatanensis, commonly known as the Kungwatan stonecrop, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant features silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native habitat."
