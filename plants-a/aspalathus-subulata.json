    "intro": "Aspalathus subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf bushveld clover, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by small, round seeds. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native region. Aspalathus subulata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
