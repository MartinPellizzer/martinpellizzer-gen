It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
