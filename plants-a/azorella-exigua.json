    "intro": "Azorella exigua, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the high Andes of South America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that forms dense, cushion-like structures composed of tightly packed stems and leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, alpine environments, with small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and protect against intense solar radiation. Azorella exigua is known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, often surviving for decades or even centuries in its extreme habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
