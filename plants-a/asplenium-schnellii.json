    "intro": "Asplenium schnellii, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Asplenium schnellii is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices, thriving in shaded, moist environments. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a notable species in the study of epiphytic and lithophytic plants."
