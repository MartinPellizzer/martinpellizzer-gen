    "intro": "Acetosella teretifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It produces small, edible leaves that have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Acetosella teretifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
