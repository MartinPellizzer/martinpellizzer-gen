    "intro": "Acajou, commonly known as mahogany, is a tropical tree species native to Central and South America. It is valued for its rich, dark wood that is highly sought after in the furniture and construction industries. The tree can grow up to 50 meters tall and has a straight trunk with a dense, buttressed root system. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. The bark is thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine."
