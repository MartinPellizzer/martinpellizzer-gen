    "intro": "Ammi majus var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated fennel, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often serrated, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and its seeds are small, hairy, and aromatic. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its medicinal properties and historical use in traditional remedies, it has been cultivated for both ornamental and practical purposes."
