    "intro": "Anatherum virginicum subvar. urbanianum, commonly known as the urban bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and urban environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It is characterized by its bluish-gray foliage and is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique floral structure and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
