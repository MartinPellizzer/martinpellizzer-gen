    "intro": "Asplenium obtusatum var. difforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern family (Aspleniaceae). It is characterized by its dark green, leathery, and broadly ovate to elliptical fronds that are often slightly curled. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, typical of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
