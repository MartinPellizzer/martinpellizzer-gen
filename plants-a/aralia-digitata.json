    "intro": "Aralia digitata, commonly known as American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound, feather-like leaves that are typically 1 to 3 feet long, with a distinctive, palmately divided structure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries that attract birds. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. Aralia digitata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
