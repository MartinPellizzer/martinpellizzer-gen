    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia concordiana is primarily native to the western regions of South America, specifically in countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. It is commonly found in the Andean foothills and valleys, where it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. This species is well adapted to dry and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands or along riverbanks. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Acacia concordiana is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens outside its natural range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia concordiana was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often seen along roadsides and in open grasslands. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it has been used for soil stabilization and as a forage plant. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
