    "intro": "Ampelopsis himalayana, commonly known as Himalayan grapevines, is a climbing vine native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural study and ecological research."
