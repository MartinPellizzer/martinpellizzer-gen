    "intro": "Astragalus curvicaulis, commonly known as the curledstem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, winding stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus curvicaulis is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
