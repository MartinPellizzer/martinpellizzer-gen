    "intro": "Aristolochia foetida, commonly known as the stinking Benjamin, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, often hairy leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe or a helmet. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain toxic seeds. Its roots and leaves have been used in traditional medicine, though the plant is toxic and should not be consumed. The species is also notable for its role in the life cycle of certain butterfly species."
