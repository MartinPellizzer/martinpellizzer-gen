    "intro": "Arctogentia propinqua, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Arctogentia propinqua is an important species for studying alpine plant adaptations and biodiversity in mountain ecosystems."
