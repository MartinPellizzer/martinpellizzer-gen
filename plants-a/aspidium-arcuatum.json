    "intro": "Aspidium arcuatum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are extensively branched and help anchor it to substrates such as rocks or soil. Aspidium arcuatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
