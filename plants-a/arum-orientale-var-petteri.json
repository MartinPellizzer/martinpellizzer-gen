    "intro": "Arum orientale var. petteri, commonly known as the Petter's arrowhead, is a striking ornamental plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a glossy surface. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, white to pale purple spathe. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in tropical gardens. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
