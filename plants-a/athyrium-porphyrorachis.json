    "intro": "Athyrium porphyrorachis, commonly known as the purple-veined fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are adorned with striking purple veins, giving it its common name. Native to the temperate regions of East Asia, including China and Japan, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. The fronds are typically arching and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, with a lush, feathery appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to care for when provided with the right conditions."
