    "intro": "Antirrhinum molle var. gadorense, commonly known as the Gadorensis Snapdragon, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
