    "intro": "Alchemilla cartalinica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, velvety leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright inflorescences. Alchemilla cartalinica thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental foliage and hardiness."
