    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. caucasica, commonly known as the Caucasian columbine, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
