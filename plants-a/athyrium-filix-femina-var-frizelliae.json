    "intro": "Athyrium filix-femina var. frizelliae, commonly known as the Frizell's lady fern, is a variant of the common lady fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching and gracefully shaped. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus clusters, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
