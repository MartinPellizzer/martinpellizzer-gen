    "intro": "Acanthella plicata, commonly known as the pleated acanthella, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, pleated leaves that give it its common name, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. Acanthella plicata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthella plicata is primarily native to the eastern coast of Australia, including regions such as Queensland and New South Wales. It is commonly found in coastal and estuarine environments, often growing in sandy or muddy soils. This plant thrives in brackish water conditions and is frequently associated with mangrove ecosystems. It plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the tropical and subtropical regions of eastern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthella plicata was mainly introduced to the coastal regions of southern Australia, where it has since become established in both natural and disturbed habitats. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, often growing in dense clusters. The plant's ability to thrive in salty and windy conditions has contributed to its successful spread along the shorelines. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature. However, it also provides habitat and food for certain native wildlife."
