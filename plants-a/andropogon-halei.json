    "intro": "Andropogon halei, commonly known as Hale's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are often blue or purple in color. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon halei is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience in wetland environments."
