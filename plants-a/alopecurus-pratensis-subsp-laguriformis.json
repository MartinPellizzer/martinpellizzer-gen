    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis subsp. laguriformis, commonly known as meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and wetlands. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability."
