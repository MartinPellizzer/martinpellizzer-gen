    "intro": "Androsace handel-mazzettii, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the high altitudes of eastern Asia. It features a rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its delicate structure and preference for cool, humid environments, it is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
