    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. straminea, commonly known as silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and creeping growth habit, forming dense mats or turf-like structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
