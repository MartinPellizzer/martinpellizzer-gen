    "intro": "Aphanostylis exserens, commonly known as the common hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of many grasses. Aphanostylis exserens is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its ability to thrive in a variety of habitats makes it an important component of many grassland ecosystems."
