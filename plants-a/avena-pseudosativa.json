    "intro": "Avena pseudosativa, commonly known as false oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. While not as widely cultivated as true oats, it is sometimes used in ornamental gardening or as a forage crop."
