    "intro": "Astragalus membranaceus var. obtusus, commonly known as Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China. It is characterized by its hairy, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported immune-boosting properties. Its ecological role includes nitrogen fixation, which benefits soil fertility in degraded habitats."
