    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon crassifolium is primarily native to Mexico and Central America. It is found in regions such as southern Mexico, including the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to moist forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can be found in both lowland and mountainous areas. Its native range extends into parts of northern South America, including Ecuador and Colombia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon crassifolium was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. This plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range, leading to ecological concerns in certain areas."
