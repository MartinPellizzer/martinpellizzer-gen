    "intro": "Asplenium polydactylon, commonly known as the many-fingered spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are often clustered closely together. It produces spores in compact clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium polydactylon is often found in shaded, moist habitats across Africa and parts of Asia."
