    "intro": "Amellus pungens, commonly known as the spiny amellus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its woody stems and serrated, spiny leaves that serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Amellus pungens thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
