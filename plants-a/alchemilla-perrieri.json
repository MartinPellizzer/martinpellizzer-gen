    "intro": "Alchemilla perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, which helps to retain moisture in its arid habitat. Alchemilla perrieri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high altitudes with cool, dry conditions."
