    "intro": "Amygdalus persica nuda, commonly known as the naked peach, is a wild variant of the peach tree characterized by its reduced or absent thorns. It is native to the regions of Central Asia and the Middle East, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that precede the development of its edible, fuzzy peaches. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a slightly serrated edge. The fruit, while similar to the common peach, is often smaller and less sweet, making it more suitable for foraging or ornamental purposes."
