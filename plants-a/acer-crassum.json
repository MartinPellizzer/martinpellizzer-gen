    "intro": "Acer crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant colors in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Acer crassum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitats.",

The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen in forested areas and along stream banks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within this region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer crassum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since established itself in various regions, especially in the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forested areas and along streambanks. Its introduction has led to both ecological and ornamental significance, making it a popular choice for landscaping. However, its spread has also raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
