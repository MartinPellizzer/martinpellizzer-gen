    "intro": "Arethusa simplex, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshes in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Arethusa simplex thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
