    "intro": "Aspidosperma riedelii var. genuinum, commonly known as the Brazilian redwood, is a species of flowering plant in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, woody fruits. It is valued for its durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
