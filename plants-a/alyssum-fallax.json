    "intro": "Alyssum fallax, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silver-gray foliage with fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Alyssum fallax thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to both wild and cultivated environments."
