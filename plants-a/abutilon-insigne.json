The plant typically grows in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is often seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions in South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon insigne was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and urban environments, often spreading through seed dispersal by wind and water. It is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils. Despite its aesthetic appeal, its invasive tendencies have raised concerns among conservationists."
