    "intro": "Acer amoenum f. latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed maple, is a variant of the Amur maple, characterized by its distinctive foliage. It features palmately lobed leaves with broad, rounded lobes that are typically a vibrant green during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The broad-lobed maple is relatively low maintenance and can adapt to a variety of soil types.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer amoenum f. latilobum is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. This plant thrives in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils within temperate forests. The species is known for its distinctive broad, lobed leaves and is often associated with mixed evergreen and deciduous forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amoenum f. latilobum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf morphology. It is commonly cultivated in temperate regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and public spaces. This form is a variation of the common maple, characterized by its broader and more elongated leaf lobes. It has been widely distributed in North America, particularly in the eastern United States, where it is favored for its adaptability and visual appeal. Despite its ornamental popularity, it is not typically invasive in its introduced range."
