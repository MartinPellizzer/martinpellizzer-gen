It is a bulbous plant characterized by its clustered underground stems, known as bulbs, which are the primary part used in cooking. The plant produces grass-like leaves and small white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. Garlic is rich in sulfur compounds, which contribute to its pungent aroma and health benefits. Its cultivation involves well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial in many climates."
