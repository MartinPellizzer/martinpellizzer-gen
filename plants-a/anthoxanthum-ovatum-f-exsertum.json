It features narrow, linear leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils or open habitats. Its botanical structure includes hollow stems and a fibrous root system, which contribute to its adaptability. This form is distinguished by its elongated inflorescences that extend beyond the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance."
