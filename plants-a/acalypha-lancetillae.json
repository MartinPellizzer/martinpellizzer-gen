    "intro": "Acalypha lancetillae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is known for its diverse and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha lancetillae is primarily native to Belize, Honduras, and the Mexican Gulf. This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. The species is part of the Euphorbiaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental members. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the humid and warm climates of Central America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha lancetillae was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It was likely brought there by human activity, possibly as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread into native ecosystems, posing a threat to local biodiversity. It is considered an invasive species in Hawaii because of its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and protect the island's unique flora."
