    "intro": "Androsace laggeri, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-eared cowslip, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are generally succulent and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, aiding in water retention in harsh environments. Androsace laggeri is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
