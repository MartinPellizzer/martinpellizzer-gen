    "intro": "Agrostis nutkaensis, commonly known as Nutka grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, often hairless stems. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in open woodlands or along streambanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually slender and slightly compressed. Nutka grass is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
