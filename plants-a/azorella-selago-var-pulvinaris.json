    "intro": "Azorella selago var. pulvinaris, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming species native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit that resembles a cushion, helping it withstand harsh alpine conditions. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. This variety is particularly adapted to cold, dry environments and is often found in rocky or barren soils at high elevations."
