    "intro": "Astragalus clavatus, commonly known as the clubbed milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has small, round, and sometimes hairy seed pods that mature into a distinctive club shape. Astragalus clavatus is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
