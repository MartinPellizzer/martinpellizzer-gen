    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. granulata, commonly known as the granular saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are covered in a fine, granular texture, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to saline and alkaline soils, making it a valuable species for stabilizing coastal and inland dunes. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
