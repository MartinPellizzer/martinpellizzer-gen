    "intro": "Acantholimon manakyanii, commonly known as the Armenian thimbleweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Plumbagaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its habitat. Acantholimon manakyanii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon manakyanii is primarily native to the Transcaucasus. This region encompasses parts of modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. It is found in mountainous areas with rocky soils and dry climates. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often in alpine meadows and steppe regions. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the Transcaucasus, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon manakyanii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silvery foliage and compact growth habit. It is commonly found in gardens and rockeries, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown limited naturalization outside of cultivated areas. The plant's introduction has been primarily through horticultural trade rather than natural dispersal. However, its ecological impact remains minimal in most regions where it is grown."
