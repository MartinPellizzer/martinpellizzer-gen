    "intro": "Astragalus granitovii, commonly known as the granitic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions such as drought and extreme temperatures. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus granitovii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying plant adaptation strategies."
