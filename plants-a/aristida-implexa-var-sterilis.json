    "intro": "Aristida implexa var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It is a low-growing species that forms dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range. Due to its limited seed production, it is often propagated vegetatively rather than through seeds."
