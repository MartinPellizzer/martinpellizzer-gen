    "intro": "Anthoxanthum laxum, commonly known as the slender oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a compact, low-growing habit. Anthoxanthum laxum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
