    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. filifolia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, filiform (thread-like) leaves and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed sites. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it is less commonly cultivated than other grass species."
