    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. schiwereckii, commonly known as the Schiwereck's woundwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a low-growing, perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often found in alpine or steppe regions. Its subspecies status reflects genetic differentiation from the more widespread Anthyllis vulneraria, likely due to geographic isolation and ecological adaptation."
