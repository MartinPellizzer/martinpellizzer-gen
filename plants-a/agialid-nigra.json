    "intro": "Agialid nigra, commonly known as black marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Agialid nigra plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and supporting biodiversity."
