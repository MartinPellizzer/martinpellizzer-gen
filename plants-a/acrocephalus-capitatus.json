    "intro": "Acrocephalus capitatus, commonly known as the marsh warbler, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist environments such as marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its preference for wetlands, it is often an indicator species for healthy aquatic ecosystems.",
