    "intro": "Agrostis epigejos, commonly known as the creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth on the ground, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in lawns and golf courses due to its fine texture and durability. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
