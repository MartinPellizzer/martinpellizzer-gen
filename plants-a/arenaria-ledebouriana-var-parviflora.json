    "intro": "Arenaria ledebouriana var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
