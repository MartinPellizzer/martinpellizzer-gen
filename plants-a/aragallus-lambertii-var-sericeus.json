    "intro": "Aragallus lambertii var. sericeus, commonly known as the silky aragallus, is a rare and striking member of the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its soft, silky hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost velvety appearance. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, producing a range of colors from white to pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
