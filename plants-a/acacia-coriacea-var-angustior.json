    "intro": "Acacia coriacea var. angustior, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and narrow, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is often used in revegetation projects due to its resilience and ability to fix nitrogen.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia coriacea var. angustior is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland and the Northern Territory. This variant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. It thrives in open woodlands and shrublands, often growing in association with other drought-tolerant species. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate of its native range, with a deep root system and thick foliage to conserve water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native fauna.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia coriacea var. angustior was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and western parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its invasive potential in certain environments. However, it also plays a role in supporting local wildlife and providing habitat in degraded landscapes."
