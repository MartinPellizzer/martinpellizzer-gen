    "intro": "Anthurium subtriangulare, commonly known as the triangular anthurium, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a showy, colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium subtriangulare is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and unique flowering structure."
