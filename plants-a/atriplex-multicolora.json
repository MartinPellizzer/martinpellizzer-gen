    "intro": "Atriplex multicolora, commonly known as the multicolored saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often coated with a salt-excreting layer, a feature that helps it survive in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it an important component of desert ecosystems. Atriplex multicolora is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its vibrant foliage colors."
