    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. eremita, commonly known as the eremite fir, is a rare and unique variant of the white fir. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. Native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its cones are typically small and clustered, and it produces both male and female cones on the same plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. eremita is primarily native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes Mountains in South America. This variety is found in countries such as Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. It typically grows in cloud forests and paramo ecosystems at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,500 meters. The plant is adapted to the cool, moist climate and nutrient-poor soils of these regions. It is an important component of the local biodiversity and plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. eremita was mainly introduced to specific regions with high altitudes and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous areas. This variant is particularly adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it suitable for alpine environments. It has been introduced to parts of Europe and South America, where similar ecological conditions exist. The introduction of this plant is often associated with horticultural and ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. However, its spread is limited by its specific habitat requirements and climatic constraints."
