    "intro": "Acanthopale humblotii, commonly known as the Humboldt's acanthopale, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the dry season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important subject for botanical research.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopale humblotii is primarily native to Madagascar. This endemic species is found in the tropical rainforests of the island, particularly in the eastern and southern regions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with rich, well-drained soil. The plant is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of Madagascar, which support a high level of biodiversity. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopale humblotii was mainly introduced to disturbed areas such as roadsides, waste lands, and urban environments due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it can establish itself quickly in open, sunny habitats. This plant is often spread through human activities, including accidental transport via vehicles or dumped plant material. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a potential invasive species in non-native regions. However, its ecological impact varies depending on the local environment and competition with native flora."
