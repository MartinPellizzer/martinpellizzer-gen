    "intro": "Andropogon virginicus var. vaginatus, commonly known as the eastern gamagrass, is a variant of the big bluestem grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, stiff stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that turn golden in the fall. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowering spikes are usually pale green to brown, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife. This variant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to form dense stands."
