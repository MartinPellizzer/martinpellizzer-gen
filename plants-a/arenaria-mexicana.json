    "intro": "Arenaria mexicana, commonly known as Mexican sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, bright pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Arenaria mexicana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
