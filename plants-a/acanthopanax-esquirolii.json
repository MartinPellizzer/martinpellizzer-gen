    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthopanax esquirolii is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in mountainous areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in dense forests and is often associated with secondary growth habitats. It is also present in parts of southern India and the eastern Himalayas. Due to its adaptability, it can be found at elevations ranging from lowland to mid-mountain regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopanax esquirolii was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been reported in several regions of the United States, including the Pacific Northwest and the eastern coastal states. The plant is typically found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread beyond cultivated areas and compete with native vegetation. Despite its ornamental value, proper management is recommended to prevent its establishment in natural habitats."
