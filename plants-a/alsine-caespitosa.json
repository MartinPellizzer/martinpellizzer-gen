    "intro": "Alsine caespitosa, commonly known as tufted alsike, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Alsine caespitosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
