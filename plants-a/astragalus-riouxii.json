    "intro": "Astragalus riouxii, commonly known as the Rioux's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus riouxii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife. Its ecological significance is notable in its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in nutrient-poor environments."
