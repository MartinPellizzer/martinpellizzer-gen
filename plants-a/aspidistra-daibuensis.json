    "intro": "Aspidistra daibuensis, commonly known as the Daibu aspidistra, is a rare evergreen perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Araceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery foliage with a distinctive midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically hidden within a spathe, a feature common in many aroid species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
