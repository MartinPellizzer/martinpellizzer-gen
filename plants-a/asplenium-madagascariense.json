    "intro": "Asplenium madagascariense, commonly known as the Madagascar maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth or on rocky surfaces. Its rhizomes are wiry and help anchor it to substrates, while its spores are dispersed through the air. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
