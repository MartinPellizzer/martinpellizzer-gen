It is also found in northern Mexico, including the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and Tamaulipas. This plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in areas with mild, arid climates. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and along fences. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated areas as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon \u00d7 luteum-album was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and fuzzy foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in the southern and western regions of the country. The plant thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its ecological role. However, it has occasionally escaped cultivation and been reported in natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas with suitable growing conditions and human intervention."
