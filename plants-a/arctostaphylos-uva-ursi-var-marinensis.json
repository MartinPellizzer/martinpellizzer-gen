    "intro": "Arctostaphylos uva-ursi var. marinensis, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of leathery, elliptic to ovate leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a whitish underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a clustered drupe, containing small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind and animals. This variety is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and well-drained soils, and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
