    "intro": "Antidesma salicifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf antidesma, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
