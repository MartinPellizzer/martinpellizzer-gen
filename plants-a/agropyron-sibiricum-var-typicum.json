    "intro": "Agropyron sibiricum var. typicum, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including sandy soils and arid conditions, making it a hardy species. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
