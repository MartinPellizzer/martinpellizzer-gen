    "intro": "Auriculardisia coclensis, commonly known as the Cocl\u00e9 auriculate, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-shaped) leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
