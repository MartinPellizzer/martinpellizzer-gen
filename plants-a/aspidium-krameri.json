    "intro": "Aspidium krameri, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize wetland areas. Aspidium krameri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its aesthetic qualities."
