    "intro": "Alcantarea aurantiaca, commonly known as the Orange Alcantaria, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its large, colorful, and often spiky leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces vibrant orange flowers that bloom in the center of the leaf rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Alcantarea aurantiaca is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
