It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves and produces pale yellow to white flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. This variant is distinguished by its pale coloration and is sometimes considered a subspecies or variety of the broader Antennaria canadensis species."
