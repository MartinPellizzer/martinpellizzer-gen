    "intro": "Anisomeles viscidula, commonly known as sticky anisomeles, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, sticky leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found near water sources. The sticky secretions on its leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
