    "intro": "Adonis flava, commonly known as the yellow globeflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the top of its slender stems. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, and its roots are tuberous, which help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rocky gardens. Adonis flava is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional medicine for its purported healing effects.",
