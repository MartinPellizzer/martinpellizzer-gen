    "intro": "Aster scribneri, commonly known as Scribner's aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to blue flowers that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits called cypsela. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
