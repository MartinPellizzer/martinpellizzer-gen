It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is notable for its hard, woody fruits that enclose a single seed, which is often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts.",
