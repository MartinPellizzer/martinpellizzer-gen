    "intro": "Antirrhinum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and clusters of bright red or orange tubular flowers that resemble tiny snout-like structures. The leaves are lance-shaped and serrated, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
