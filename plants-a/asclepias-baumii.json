    "intro": "Asclepias baumii, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, green foliage and clusters of bright orange to red flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, sticky seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Asclepias baumii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential sustenance for its larvae. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
