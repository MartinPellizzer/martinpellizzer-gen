    "intro": "Astragalus tennesseensis, commonly known as Tennessee milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
