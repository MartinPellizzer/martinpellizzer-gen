    "intro": "Acer mono var. acutissimum, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking, finely toothed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant has a compact, upright growth habit with a broad, spreading crown. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental tree in gardens.",
