    "intro": "Amylotheca tenuis, commonly known as the slender leaf lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner from the Ascomycota division. Amylotheca tenuis is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and tropical regions. It is a slow-growing species that plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat."
