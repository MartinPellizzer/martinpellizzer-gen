    "intro": "Actinidia deliciosa, commonly known as kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, fuzzy green fruits that turn yellow or brown when ripe. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires a cold winter dormancy period for optimal fruit production. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five sepals and petals, and it is typically dioecious, meaning male and female flowers are found on separate plants. The fruit is rich in vitamins and antioxidants, making it a valuable crop in agriculture.",
