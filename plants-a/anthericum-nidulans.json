    "intro": "Anthericum nidulans, commonly known as the clustered arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a showy, spatulate bract. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is covered in tiny, male flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in marshes and along riverbanks. The species is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and its ability to form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
