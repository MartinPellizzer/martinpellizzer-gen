It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, petal-like sepals and delicate, white to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the stems are often hairy, providing protection against harsh weather.
