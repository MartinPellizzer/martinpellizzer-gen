    "intro": "Aegilops variabilis var. latiuscula, commonly known as the slender wild rye, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat species."
