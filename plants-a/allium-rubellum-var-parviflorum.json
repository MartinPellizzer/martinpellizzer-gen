    "intro": "Allium rubellum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the dwarf red onion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered purple flowers in early summer. The plant is characterized by its pale red or pink bulbs, which are typically smaller than those of common onions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and mild, onion-like fragrance."
