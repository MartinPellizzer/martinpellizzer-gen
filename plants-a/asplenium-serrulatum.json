    "intro": "Asplenium serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, walls, and forest floors. The plant has lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a dark green color and a leathery texture. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Asplenium serrulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging growing conditions."
