It has a dense, tufted growth form with closely spaced, elongated leaves that are often recurved at the tips. The leaves are usually dark green and have a smooth, shiny surface. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish capsules that are borne on short, erect stalks. It is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to thrive in harsh, rocky environments."
