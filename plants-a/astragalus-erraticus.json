    "intro": "Astragalus erraticus, commonly known as the wandering milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets, and its root system is deep, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Astragalus erraticus is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
