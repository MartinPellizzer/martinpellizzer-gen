It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea lalindei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
