    "intro": "Arachnorchis cremna, commonly known as the Cremna spider orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, thin, hair-like leaves and a single, slender flower spike. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent, elongated sepals and petals. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in rainforest areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
