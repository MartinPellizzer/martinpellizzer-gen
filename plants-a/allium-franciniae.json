    "intro": "Allium franciniae, commonly known as the Corsican leek, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Corsica. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its long, slender leaves and small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, woodland areas. Its botanical features include a bulbous base and a distinct garlic-like odor when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium franciniae is considered a vulnerable species."
