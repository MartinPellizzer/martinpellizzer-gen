    "intro": "Acer ribesifolium, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage in the fall, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow during autumn. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. Acer ribesifolium typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade.",
