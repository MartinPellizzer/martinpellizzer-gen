It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, commonly referred to as the ice plant family. The plant is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Artanthe alnoides thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats."
