    "intro": "Aristida californica var. fugitiva, commonly known as the California threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and rocky areas. The plant features slender, wiry stems with small, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a rough texture. This variety is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
