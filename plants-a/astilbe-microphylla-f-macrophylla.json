    "intro": "Astilbe microphylla f. macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf astilbe, is a cultivar of the astilbe plant characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to the typical form. It is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia, particularly China, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces panicles of pink to red flowers in late summer, adding vibrant color to shaded gardens. Its foliage is dark green and often remains attractive throughout the growing season. It is well-suited for woodland gardens and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth."
