    "intro": "Arachniodes valida, commonly known as the spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its intricate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that helps anchor it to its substrate. Arachniodes valida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens and as a houseplant."
