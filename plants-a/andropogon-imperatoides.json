It is characterized by its deep root system, which allows it to thrive in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces large, blue-green flowers in late summer, which are typical of the grass family Poaceae. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems. Big bluestem is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and restoration projects."
