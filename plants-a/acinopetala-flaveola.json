    "intro": "Acinopetala flaveola, commonly known as the yellow-flowered acacia, is a shrub native to parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often giving it a striking appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in horticulture.",
