    "intro": "Ampalis mauritiana, commonly known as the Mauritius starling plant, is a flowering plant native to the Mascarene Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and has lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round fruits that are edible. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
