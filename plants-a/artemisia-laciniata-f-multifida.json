The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and aromatic foliage, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
