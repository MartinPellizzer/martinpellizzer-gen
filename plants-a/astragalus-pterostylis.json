    "intro": "Astragalus pterostylis, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid conditions through its deep root system. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus pterostylis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
