    "intro": "Atopoglossum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate tongueflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a creeping stem that lies close to the ground, with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
