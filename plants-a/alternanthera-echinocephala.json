    "intro": "Alternanthera echinocephala, commonly known as the spiked amaranth, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant red or purple bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening, though it can be invasive in some regions. The seeds are small and produced in clusters, contributing to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable environments."
