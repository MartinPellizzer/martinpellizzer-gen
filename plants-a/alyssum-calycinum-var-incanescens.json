    "intro": "Alyssum calycinum var. incanescens, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
