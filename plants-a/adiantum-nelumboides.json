    "intro": "Adiantum nelumboides, commonly known as the water fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of water. The plant thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and ponds, where it can receive ample moisture. Its rhizomes are typically submerged, anchoring the plant in soft, muddy substrates. Adiantum nelumboides plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms.",
