    "intro": "Allium triflorum, commonly known as the trinity garlic or three-flower garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its cluster of three narrow, grass-like leaves and a flowering stem that bears three small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, round bulbs that are typically white or yellow in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Allium triflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
