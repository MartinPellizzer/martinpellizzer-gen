    "intro": "Aspidium acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium acuminatum plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
