    "intro": "Arenaria glanduligera var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, glandular-studded leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an important component of xerophytic plant communities."
