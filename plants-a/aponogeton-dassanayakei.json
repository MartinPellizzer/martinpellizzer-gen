    "intro": "Aponogeton dassanayakei, commonly known as the Sri Lankan arrowhead, is a flowering aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Sri Lanka. It features long, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, spongy texture that aids in buoyancy. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that emerge from the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshy areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable species for wetland conservation."
