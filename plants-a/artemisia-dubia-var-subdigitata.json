    "intro": "Artemisia dubia var. subdigitata, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its aromatic leaves contain essential oils, which have been used traditionally for medicinal and aromatic purposes."
