    "intro": "Asplenium anisophyllum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile fronds producing spore-bearing structures on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. The leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive shield-shaped base that gives the plant its common name."
