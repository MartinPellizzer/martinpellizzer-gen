    "intro": "Astragalus ophiocarpus var. vermicularis, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with hairy stems and small, compound leaves. The flowers are typically pink to purple, arranged in racemes, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. This plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
