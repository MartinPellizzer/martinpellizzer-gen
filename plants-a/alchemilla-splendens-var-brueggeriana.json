    "intro": "Alchemilla splendens var. brueggeriana, commonly known as the golden alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and attractive foliage throughout the growing season."
