    "intro": "Argythamnia gymnadenia, commonly known as the broadleaf everlasting or common everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, seed-producing heads that give it its common name. It is often found in dry, open habitats such as roadsides and gravelly soils. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silver-blue hue that helps it reflect sunlight in arid environments."
