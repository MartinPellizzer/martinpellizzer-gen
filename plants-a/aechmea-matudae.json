    "intro": "Aechmea matudae, commonly known as the Matudae bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they can grow up to 1 meter in length. Aechmea matudae produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
