    "intro": "Assonia rubifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed shrub, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its distinctive reddish foliage, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months, which are followed by dark blue, waxy berries. Assonia rubifolia thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique leaf color and seasonal flowering."
