    "intro": "Ajuga remota var. crenata, commonly known as carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a common ground cover in moist habitats."
