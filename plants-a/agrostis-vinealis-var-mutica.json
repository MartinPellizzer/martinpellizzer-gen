    "intro": "Agrostis vinealis var. mutica, commonly known as velvet bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in cool, moist environments. It is characterized by its fine, dark green foliage and dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is often found in lawns, golf courses, and wet meadows due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its rhizomatous and stoloniferous growth allows it to spread rapidly and form extensive turf-like covers."
