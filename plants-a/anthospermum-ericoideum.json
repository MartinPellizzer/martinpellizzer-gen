    "intro": "Anthospermum ericoideum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal dunes and sandstone formations. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Anthospermum ericoideum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for various small insects and birds."
