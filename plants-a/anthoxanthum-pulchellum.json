    "intro": "Anthoxanthum pulchellum, commonly known as the pretty oatgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are characteristic of grasses. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that becomes more pronounced as the plant matures. Anthoxanthum pulchellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
