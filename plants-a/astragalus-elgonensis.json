    "intro": "Astragalus elgonensis, commonly known as Elgon milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Elgon. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Astragalus elgonensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for herbivores and contributing to soil stabilization through its extensive root system."
