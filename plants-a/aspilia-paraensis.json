    "intro": "Aspilia paraensis, commonly known as the Paraensis flameflower, is a tropical plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, while the actual flowers are small and clustered in the center. Aspilia paraensis typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. Its botanical structure supports its role in local ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
