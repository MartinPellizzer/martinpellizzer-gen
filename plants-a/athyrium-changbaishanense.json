    "intro": "Athyrium changbaishanense, commonly known as the Changbai Mountain Athyrium, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of northeastern China. It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
