    "intro": "Asclepias modesta var. foliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive horn-shaped buds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This species is an important food source for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators."
