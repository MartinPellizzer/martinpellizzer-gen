    "intro": "Alaticaulia andresiana, commonly known as the Andes mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptations to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine soils, where it forms compact, cushion-like growths to withstand harsh weather conditions. Its flowers are often brightly colored, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alaticaulia andresiana is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
