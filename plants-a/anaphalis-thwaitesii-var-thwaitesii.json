    "intro": "Anaphalis thwaitesii var. thwaitesii, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance, with silver-white hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branching stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
