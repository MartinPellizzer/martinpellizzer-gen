    "intro": "Acer negundo f. variegatum, commonly known as the variegated box elder, is a cultivar of the box elder tree. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves that display a mix of green, white, and yellow hues. This plant is a deciduous tree or shrub native to North America, often found in moist soils along rivers and streams. Its foliage changes color with the seasons, adding ornamental value to gardens and natural landscapes. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in unique leaf patterns.",
