    "intro": "Alyssum murale f. anomalum, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a compact, low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
