It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, blue-green leaves that often have a silvery or white coating. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on tall, branched inflorescences during the spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to both indoor and outdoor landscapes."
