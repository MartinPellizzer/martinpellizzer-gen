    "intro": "Archontophoenix veitchii, commonly known as the Veitch's palm, is a tall, slender palm native to Madagascar. It features a single, unbranched trunk that is smooth and often covered in a fibrous sheath. The plant produces large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length, contributing to its striking appearance. Its flowers are small and clustered in spadices, typical of many palm species. The fruit is a drupe that contains a single seed, and the plant is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
