    "intro": "Astragalus hamosus var. brachyceras, commonly known as the short-corked milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact corolla compared to other Astragalus species."
