    "intro": "Adiantum silvaticum, commonly known as the woods fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. Adiantum silvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions.",
