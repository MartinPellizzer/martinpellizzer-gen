    "intro": "Asplenium heterocarpum, commonly known as the heterocarpous spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant produces two types of sporangia\u2014heterocarpous\u2014on the same sporophylls, a unique feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium heterocarpum is typically found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
