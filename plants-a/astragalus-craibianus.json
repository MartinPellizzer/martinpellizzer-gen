    "intro": "Astragalus craibianus, commonly known as the Craib's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
