    "intro": "Alsine friesiana, commonly known as the Friesian sandplant, is a low-growing annual herb native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or pale blue in color. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alsine friesiana is adapted to tolerate salt spray and is an important part of coastal ecosystems."
