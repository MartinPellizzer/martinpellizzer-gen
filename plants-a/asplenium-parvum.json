    "intro": "Asplenium parvum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, dense rosettes of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fertile leaves, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium parvum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
