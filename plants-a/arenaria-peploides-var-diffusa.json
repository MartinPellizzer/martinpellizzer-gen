    "intro": "Arenaria peploides var. diffusa, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and sandy environments. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss in dry climates. It is also known for its ability to stabilize sand dunes through its extensive root system."
