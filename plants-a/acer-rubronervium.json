    "intro": "Acer rubronervium, commonly known as the red-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, featuring leaves with bright red veins contrasting against green or yellowish-green leaf blades. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more furrowed with age. Acer rubronervium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
