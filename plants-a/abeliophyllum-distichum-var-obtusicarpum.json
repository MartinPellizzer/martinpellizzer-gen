    "intro": "Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum, commonly known as the Japanese snowbell, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its opposite, elongated leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by distinctive, blunt, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its compact growth habit and seasonal beauty make it a valuable addition to woodland or cottage garden settings.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in humid, cool climates with well-drained soils, often growing in mixed forests or on rocky slopes. The species is known for its ornamental value, particularly due to its fragrant white flowers. It is a member of the Caprifoliaceae family and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abeliophyllum distichum var. obtusicarpum was mainly introduced to the eastern and central United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique floral characteristics. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where it thrives in partial shade to full sun conditions. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value rather than for ecological purposes. It has been reported in several states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Virginia. However, its invasive potential remains under study, and its impact on native ecosystems is still being assessed."
