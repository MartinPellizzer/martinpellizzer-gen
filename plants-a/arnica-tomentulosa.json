    "intro": "Arnica tomentulosa, commonly known as the woolly arnica, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arnica tomentulosa is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
