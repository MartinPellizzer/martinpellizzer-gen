    "intro": "Acrostichum urvillei, commonly known as the broadleaf tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of persistent, fibrous roots. Its reproductive structures are concealed within the fronds, and it relies on spores for propagation. Acrostichum urvillei thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests.",
