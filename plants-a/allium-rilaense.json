It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale purple flowers.

Allium rilaense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
