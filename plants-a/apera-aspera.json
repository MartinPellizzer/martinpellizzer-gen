    "intro": "Apera aspera, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Apera aspera is notable for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
