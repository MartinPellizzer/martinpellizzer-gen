    "intro": "Acacia habbasioides, commonly known as the Sudan acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its straight, often thornless stems and bipinnate leaves that are densely clustered at the base of the branches. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are followed by long, slender pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it an important component of the local flora in these regions. Acacia habbasioides is also valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a source of browse for wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia habbasioides is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and Ethiopia. It is commonly found in dry, rocky, and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and mountainous habitats. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing shelter for wildlife. Its distribution is limited to specific geographic regions due to its adaptation to arid and tropical climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia habbasioides was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value and potential for soil stabilization. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides, particularly in the Western and Eastern Cape provinces. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it has also shown invasive tendencies in some areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact. Its introduction has been part of broader efforts to enhance biodiversity and land management in the region."
