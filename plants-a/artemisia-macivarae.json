    "intro": "Artemisia macivarae, commonly known as the Sierra Madre wormwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and aromatic, pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Artemisia macivarae is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats. Its essential oils contain compounds with potential medicinal properties, though it is generally considered toxic in large quantities."
