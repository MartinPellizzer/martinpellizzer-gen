    "intro": "Ardisia grandifolia, commonly known as the large-flowered ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Following flowering, it produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia grandifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
