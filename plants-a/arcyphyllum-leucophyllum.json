It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae, which includes cypress and juniper. White sage is often used in traditional medicine and as a ceremonial plant due to its strong fragrance and purported healing properties."
