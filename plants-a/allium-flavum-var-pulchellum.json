It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged bulbs, which are smaller than typical garlic bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders."
