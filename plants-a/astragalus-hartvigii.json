    "intro": "Astragalus hartvigii, commonly known as Hartvig's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus hartvigii is also known for its medicinal properties, though it is not widely used in modern herbal medicine."
