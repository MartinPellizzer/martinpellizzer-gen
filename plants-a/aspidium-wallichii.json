    "intro": "Aspidium wallichii, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that are typically bipinnate, giving it a delicate and intricate appearance. Native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium wallichii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
