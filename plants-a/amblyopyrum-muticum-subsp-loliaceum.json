It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and grasslands, often forming dense tufts with a fibrous root system. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. It is valued for its forage quality and is sometimes used in agricultural settings. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to temperate climates and nutrient-rich soils."
