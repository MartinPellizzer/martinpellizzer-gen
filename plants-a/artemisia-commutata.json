    "intro": "Artemisia commutata, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils. Artemisia commutata is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its role in ecological restoration."
