    "intro": "Andriapetalum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rustyleaf sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a reddish or rust-colored bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
