    "intro": "Attalea peruviana, commonly known as the palm tree or \"tucum\u00e1n\" in some regions, is a species native to South America, particularly in countries like Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. It is a tall, slender palm that can grow up to 20 meters in height, with pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, yellowish-orange inflorescences that bear small, fragrant flowers. Its fruit is a large, fibrous coconut-like structure that contains a single seed. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally for its fibers and as a food source."
