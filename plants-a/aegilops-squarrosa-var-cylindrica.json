    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa var. cylindrica, commonly known as the cylindrical wild rye, is a grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system. This variety is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for forage and its genetic relationship to wheat."
