    "intro": "Arctium grandiceps, commonly known as the giant burdock, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces distinctive, spiny bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience in harsh environments."
