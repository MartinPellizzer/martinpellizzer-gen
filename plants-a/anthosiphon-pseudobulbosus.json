    "intro": "Anthosiphon pseudobulbosus, commonly known as the false bulb orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andes Mountains. It features a rhizomatous stem system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers in shades of yellow and green, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
