    "intro": "Acinolis, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, velvety leaves that often have a distinctive pattern. The flowers are typically clustered in a terminal inflorescence called an acinus, which gives the genus its name. Acinolis species are popular as ornamental plants due to their vibrant colors and ease of cultivation. They thrive in well-drained soil and require bright, indirect light to flourish."
