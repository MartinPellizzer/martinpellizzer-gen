    "intro": "Asplenium sulcatum, commonly known as the grooved spleenwort, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive grooved leaves. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a prominent midrib and deep grooves running along the leaf surface. It produces spores in small, clustered clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
