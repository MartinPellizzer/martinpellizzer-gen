    "intro": "Asplenium colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has slender, creeping stems with lance-shaped, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium colensoi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
