It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and is characterized by its ornamental, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow as shrubs, with opposite, simple, and often aromatic leaves. Abeliophyllum species are valued in horticulture for their fragrant blooms and attractive foliage. They prefer well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making them suitable for garden landscapes."
