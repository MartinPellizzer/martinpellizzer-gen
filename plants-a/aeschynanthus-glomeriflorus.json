It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of red and orange, often attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
