    "intro": "Ananas sativus var. pyramidalis, commonly known as the pineapple guava, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of spiny, fleshy leaves. The plant produces a small, aromatic fruit that is typically harvested when it turns from green to yellow. The fruit is rich in nutrients and has a unique flavor profile that combines the tartness of a pineapple with the sweetness of a guava. It is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and its edible fruit."
