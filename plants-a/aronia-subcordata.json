It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, aggregate berries that are typically red or black when mature. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in jams, wines, and health supplements. Aronia subcordata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
