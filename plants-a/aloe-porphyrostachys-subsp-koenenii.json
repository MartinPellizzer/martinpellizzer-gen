    "intro": "Aloe porphyrostachys subsp. koenenii, commonly known as the Koenen's aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and for their gel-like substance, which has soothing properties."
