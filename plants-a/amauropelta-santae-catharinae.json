    "intro": "Amauropelta santae-catharinae, commonly known as the Santa Catarina shield fern, is a rare and unique species native to Brazil. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with a rosette of leaves that form a dense, protective covering. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
