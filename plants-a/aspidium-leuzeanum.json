    "intro": "Aspidium leuzeanum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it in the soil. Aspidium leuzeanum is valued for its ornamental appearance and has a long history of use in herbal remedies."
