    "intro": "Athyrium depauperatum, commonly known as the barren chain fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, upright rhizome with a single, narrow, lance-shaped frond that is usually divided into several pinnae. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive chain-like pattern. Athyrium depauperatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
