It features slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are narrow, gray-green in color, and covered with fine, silky hairs that give it its common name. It produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are typically arranged in clusters. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas."
