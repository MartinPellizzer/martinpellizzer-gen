    "intro": "Aerva lanata var. orbicularis, commonly known as the orbicular aerva, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in fine hairs. The leaves are orbicular, meaning they are nearly round, with a smooth or slightly lobed margin. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks."
