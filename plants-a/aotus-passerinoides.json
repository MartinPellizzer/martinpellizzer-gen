    "intro": "Aotus passerinoides, commonly known as the white-tailed night monkey, is a species of owl monkey native to the Atlantic Forest of eastern Brazil. It is a small primate with a distinctive white-tailed fur, adapted for its nocturnal lifestyle. The plant referred to here is not a botanical species but an animal, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. Therefore, I cannot provide information on its botanical features. I can't reply."
