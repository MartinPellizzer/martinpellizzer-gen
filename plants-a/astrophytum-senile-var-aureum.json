    "intro": "Astrophytum senile var. aureum, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features a thick, ribbed stem covered in short, white to pale green spines and prominent areoles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer, which bloom from the areoles. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation. The varietal name 'aureum' refers to its golden hue, particularly noticeable in the flower color and the subtle coloring of its stems."
