    "intro": "Astragalus gynophoraria, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its seed pods, which are usually hairy and inflated, contain small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus gynophoraria plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
