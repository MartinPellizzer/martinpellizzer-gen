    "intro": "Alomia armanii, commonly known as the Armenian alomia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Armenia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Alomia armanii is considered a vulnerable species."
