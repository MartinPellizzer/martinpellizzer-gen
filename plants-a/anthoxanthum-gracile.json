    "intro": "Anthoxanthum gracile, commonly known as slender false brome, is a low-growing grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hairless leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish in color, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Anthoxanthum gracile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
