    "intro": "Agathosma adenocaulis, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate appearance to its foliage. It is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Agathosma adenocaulis is also valued for its aromatic leaves, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
