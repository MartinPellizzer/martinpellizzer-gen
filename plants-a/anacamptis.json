    "intro": "Anacamptis, commonly known as the lady's tresses, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their dense, spiral arrangement of flowers, which gives them their common name. They typically grow in moist, calcareous soils and are often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Anacamptis species are known for their delicate, often fragrant blooms that range in color from white to pink and purple. The genus includes several species, such as Anacamptis morio and Anacamptis pyramidalis, which are appreciated for their ornamental value and ecological importance."
