It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, sandy environments. It has been studied for its potential use in soil remediation due to its ability to tolerate heavy metals. Additionally, it is sometimes used as a forage plant for livestock in certain regions."
