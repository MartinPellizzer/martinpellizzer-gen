    "intro": "Asimina reticulata, commonly known as the yellow custard apple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible, yellow, fleshy fruits with a sweet, custard-like flavor. Its fruit is covered in a rough, spiny exterior and contains a single large, inedible seed. Asimina reticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
