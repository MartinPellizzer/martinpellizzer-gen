    "intro": "Aeschynomene pumila, commonly known as smallleaf burr sage, is a low-growing annual plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sandy environments. It has been studied for its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to accumulate heavy metals. Additionally, it serves as a food source for various insects and small animals."
