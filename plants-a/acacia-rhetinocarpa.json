    "intro": "Acacia rhetinocarpa, commonly known as the yellow wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads, which are typically clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds. Acacia rhetinocarpa is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",

This species thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for local wildlife. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rhetinocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. This plant is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the Northern Territory and Queensland. It is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber. Its introduction has had both ecological and economic impacts in the regions where it has been established."
