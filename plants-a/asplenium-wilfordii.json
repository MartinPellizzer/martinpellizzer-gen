    "intro": "Asplenium wilfordii, commonly known as Wilford's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has finely divided, linear to lance-shaped fronds that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in rows along the veins. Asplenium wilfordii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
