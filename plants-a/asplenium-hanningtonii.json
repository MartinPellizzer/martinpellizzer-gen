    "intro": "Asplenium hanningtonii, commonly known as the Hannington's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive appearance that resembles a spleen, hence its common name. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or along streams, where it thrives in humid conditions."
