    "intro": "Arthrophyllum biforme, commonly known as the two-form arthrophyllum, is a rare and unusual plant species native to the mountainous regions of New Zealand. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its unique leaf morphology. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are divided into two distinct forms, giving it its common name. Arthrophyllum biforme is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
