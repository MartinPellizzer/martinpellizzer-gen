    "intro": "Alismorkis masuca, commonly known as the water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. Alismorkis masuca is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various invertebrates and fish."
