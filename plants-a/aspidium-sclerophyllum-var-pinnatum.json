    "intro": "Aspidium sclerophyllum var. pinnatum, commonly known as the needle fern, is a variant of the hard-leaved fern characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, needle-like fronds. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is native to various regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
