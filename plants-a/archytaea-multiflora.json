It features erect, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant produces numerous bracts that are often mistaken for leaves, giving it its scientific name. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Archytaea multiflora thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
