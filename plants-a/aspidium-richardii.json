    "intro": "Aspidium richardii, commonly known as the mountain maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium richardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
