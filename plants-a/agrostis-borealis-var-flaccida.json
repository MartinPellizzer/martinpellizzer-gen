    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. flaccida, commonly known as the northern bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is adapted to survive extreme seasonal variations and is an important component of polar ecosystems."
