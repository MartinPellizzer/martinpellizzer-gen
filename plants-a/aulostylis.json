    "intro": "Aulostylis, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to southern Africa. The plants typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white or pale pink. Aulostylis species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
