    "intro": "Alchemilla frondosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a shiny appearance. Alchemilla frondosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
