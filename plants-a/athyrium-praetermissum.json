    "intro": "Athyrium praetermissum, commonly known as the Japanese shield fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium praetermissum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ease of cultivation."
