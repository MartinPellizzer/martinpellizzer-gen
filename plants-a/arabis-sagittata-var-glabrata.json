    "intro": "Arabis sagittata var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, glabrous (hairless) leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, cruciform flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
