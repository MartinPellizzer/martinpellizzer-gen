    "intro": "Agonis linearifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as bloom, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Agonis linearifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens and coastal landscapes."
