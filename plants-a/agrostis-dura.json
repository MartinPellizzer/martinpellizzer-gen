It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense stands. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of spikelets, each bearing small, two-lobed flowers. Agrostis dura is known for its adaptability to various soil conditions and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
