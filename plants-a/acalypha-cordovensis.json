It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with unique floral structures. The plant is characterized by its striking, spiny bracts that encase the small, inconspicuous flowers.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha cordovensis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in coastal and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with mangrove ecosystems and wetlands. It is also present in some parts of Central America and the northern coast of South America. Due to its adaptability, it can be found in a variety of moist, well-drained soils throughout its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha cordovensis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. However, it has since become a weed in some areas, particularly in the North Island. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly in agricultural and urban environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
