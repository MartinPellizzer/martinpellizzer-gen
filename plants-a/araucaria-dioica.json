    "intro": "Araucaria dioica, commonly known as the Norfolk Island pine, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to Norfolk Island in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and its distinctive, tiered arrangement of long, drooping branches. The tree has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the branches. It produces both male and female cones on separate trees, a feature known as dioecy. This plant is often cultivated as a decorative indoor plant due to its elegant appearance and ability to thrive in controlled environments."
