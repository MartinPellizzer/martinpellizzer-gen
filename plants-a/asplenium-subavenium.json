    "intro": "Asplenium subavenium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on limestone or sandstone substrates. The plant has dark green, leathery fronds that are usually clustered at the base, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a row along the underside of the fronds. Asplenium subavenium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a houseplant."
