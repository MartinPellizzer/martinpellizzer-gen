    "intro": "Aloe vallaris, commonly known as the silver aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, pointed leaves that are covered in a silvery, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing properties. Aloe vallaris is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
