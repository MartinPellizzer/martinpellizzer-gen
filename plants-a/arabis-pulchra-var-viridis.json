    "intro": "Arabis pulchra var. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered rockcress, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and vibrant foliage make it a desirable ornamental plant in rock gardens. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
