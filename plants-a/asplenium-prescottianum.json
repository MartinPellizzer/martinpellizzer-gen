    "intro": "Asplenium prescottianum, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a rare and ancient fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to three feet in length. The plant has a unique, segmented structure with a central stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its prehistoric appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
