    "intro": "Azolla guineensis, commonly known as the African water fern, is a small, floating aquatic fern belonging to the family Azollaceae. It forms dense mats on the surface of freshwater bodies, contributing to nutrient cycling and oxygen production in aquatic ecosystems. The plant is characterized by its tiny, water-filled fronds and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria within its leaf cavities. Azolla guineensis thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in rice paddies and other slow-moving water environments. Its rapid growth rate makes it both a valuable biofertilizer and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
