It is characterized by its unique floral morphology, featuring small, delicate flowers with five petals that resemble those of the genus Thalictrum. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine regions, where it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, contributing to its ornamental value in specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
