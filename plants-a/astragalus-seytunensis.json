It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
