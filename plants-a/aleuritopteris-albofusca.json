    "intro": "Aleuritopteris albofusca, commonly known as the white-veined shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with distinct, pale veins that contrast with the darker green foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to anchor itself in rich, organic soil. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns."
