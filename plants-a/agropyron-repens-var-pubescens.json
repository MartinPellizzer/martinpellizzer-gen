    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. This variety is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in erosion control and forage production."
