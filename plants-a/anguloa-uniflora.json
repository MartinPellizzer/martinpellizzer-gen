It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and a single, large, showy flower that typically blooms in shades of violet or purple. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found at high altitudes in cloud forests. Its flowers are notable for their intricate patterns and fragrance, which attract specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
