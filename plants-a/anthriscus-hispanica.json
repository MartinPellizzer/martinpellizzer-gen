    "intro": "Anthriscus hispanica, commonly known as Spanish parsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to southern Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic and often used in cooking. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbel clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. Anthriscus hispanica is valued both for its culinary uses and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
