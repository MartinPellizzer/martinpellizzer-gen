    "intro": "Agrimonia stipularis, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed capsules that split open to release its seeds, a feature typical of the genus Agrimonia. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant often grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Agrimony has a long history of use in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and astringent properties."
