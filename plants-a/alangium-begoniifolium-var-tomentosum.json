    "intro": "Alangium begoniifolium var. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly alangium, is a rare and ornamental plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, begoniifolium-like leaves that are covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it produces dark blue or black berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Due to its rarity and unique foliage, it is highly valued in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ecological significance."
