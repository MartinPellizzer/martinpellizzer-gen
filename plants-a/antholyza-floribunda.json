    "intro": "Antholyza floribunda, commonly known as the pink-flowered antholyza, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its delicate floral display."
