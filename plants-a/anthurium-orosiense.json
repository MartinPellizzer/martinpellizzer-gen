    "intro": "Anthurium orosiense, commonly known as the Orosi anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Orosi Valley in Costa Rica. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a glossy surface. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by colorful spathe, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium orosiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in indoor gardens and greenhouses."
