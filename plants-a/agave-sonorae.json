    "intro": "Agave sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran agave, is a succulent plant native to the Sonoran Desert in North America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped arrangement of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The leaves are lined with sharp spines and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces an inflorescence of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
