    "intro": "Andrachne cerebroides, commonly known as the brain-like sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, brain-like appearance, with small, rounded, and clustered leaves that resemble the folds of a human brain. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in summer, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Andrachne cerebroides is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, typically in desert or semi-desert regions."
