    "intro": "Acrostichum ramentaceum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a metallic sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of its fronds. Acrostichum ramentaceum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems.",
