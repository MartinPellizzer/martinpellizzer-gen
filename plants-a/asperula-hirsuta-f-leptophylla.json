It is a low-growing evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The leaves are narrow, leathery, and slightly hairy, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in umbels. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
