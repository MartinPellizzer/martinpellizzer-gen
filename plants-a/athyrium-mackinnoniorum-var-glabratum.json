It is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its leaves are usually glabrous, meaning they lack hairy or fuzzy textures, giving it a smooth appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
