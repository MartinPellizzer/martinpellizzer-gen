    "intro": "Anisochilus kanyakumariensis, commonly known as Kanyakumari aniseed, is a rare and endemic fern species found exclusively in the southern tip of India. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its unique morphology, including its finely divided fronds and distinctive sori arrangement. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in rocky crevices or along the coastal regions of Kerala. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to its rarity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
