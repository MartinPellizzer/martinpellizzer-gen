    "intro": "Acantholimon quinquelobum var. curviflorum, commonly known as the curlyflower sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens.",

This plant is typically found in regions with rocky or mountainous terrain. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with alpine or subalpine habitats. The species is known for its distinctive floral structure and is part of the Plumbagaceae family. Its native distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon quinquelobum var. curviflorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, typically in coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or disturbed sites. This plant is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It has a low-growing habit with blue-gray foliage and showy pink or purple flowers. Its introduction has helped in reclaiming degraded coastal habitats and promoting biodiversity in such environments."
