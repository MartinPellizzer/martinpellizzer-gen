    "intro": "Annona danforthii, commonly known as the Mexican apple, is a tropical plant native to Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, featuring smooth, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive yellow center, which are followed by green, round fruits that turn yellow when ripe. The fruit has a thick, leathery skin and a sweet, creamy pulp with a mild, tropical flavor. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruit, though it is less commonly cultivated than other annona species."
