    "intro": "Arisaema robustum f. atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaf arisaema, is a striking ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, adding visual interest to gardens. The plant produces unique, spadix-shaped inflorescences surrounded by a showy, spatulate bract, which can be green, yellow, or red depending on the variety. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
