    "intro": "Allium hooshidaryae, commonly known as the Iranian garlic, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers during the spring season. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool climate for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
