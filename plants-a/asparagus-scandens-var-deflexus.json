    "intro": "Asparagus scandens var. deflexus, commonly known as the creeping asparagus or the drooping asparagus, is a climbing shrub native to South Africa. It features thin, wiry stems that can trail or climb along the ground or over other vegetation. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its compound leaves are pinnate, with several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The berries that follow the flowers are red and edible, often consumed by birds and small mammals."
