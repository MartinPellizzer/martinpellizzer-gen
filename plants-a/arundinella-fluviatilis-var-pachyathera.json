    "intro": "Arundinella fluviatilis var. pachyathera, commonly known as the thick-leaf river reed, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its robust, thick, and often glabrous leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands in wetland and riparian habitats. The species is adapted to fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
