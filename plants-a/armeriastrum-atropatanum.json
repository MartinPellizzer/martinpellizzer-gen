    "intro": "Armeriastrum atropatanum, commonly known as the blackfoot sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Armeriastrum atropatanum is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
