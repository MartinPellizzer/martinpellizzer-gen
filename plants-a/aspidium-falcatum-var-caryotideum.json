It is a fern that typically grows in wet, shady environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has large, feather-like fronds that are often divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a lush, intricate appearance. Its rhizomes are submerged or partially submerged, anchoring it in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist conditions and its distinctive, broad, lance-shaped leaves."
