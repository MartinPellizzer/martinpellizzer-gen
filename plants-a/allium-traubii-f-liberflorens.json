    "intro": "Allium traubii f. liberflorens, commonly known as the free-flowering garlic, is a botanical variant of Allium traubii, characterized by its abundant flowering habit. It is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in southern Europe. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible, though they are generally smaller and less pungent than those of common garlic varieties. This cultivar is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and mild garlic aroma."
