    "intro": "Aloe maningoryensis, commonly known as the Madagascar aloe, is a succulent plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted for water storage. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, and they bear small, spiny teeth along the margins. This species produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the warmer months, which are followed by red or orange berries. Aloe maningoryensis is well-suited to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
