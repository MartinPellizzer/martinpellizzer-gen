    "intro": "Armeria caespitosa var. splendens, commonly known as the Splendour Sea Thrift, is a hardy, low-growing plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of bright pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
