    "intro": "Aliciella triodon var. humillima, commonly known as the dwarf three-toothed fern, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its rhizome is short and thick, supporting the growth of its small, clustered fronds. The species is notable for its unique morphology and is often found in humid, tropical climates."
