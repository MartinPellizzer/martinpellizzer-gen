    "intro": "Arctium tomentosum subsp. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is recognized for its large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, and its spiky, bur-like seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in waste areas. The plant has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
