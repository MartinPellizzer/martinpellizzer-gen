    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris var. reniformis, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, upright clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more rounded leaves compared to other forms of Alchemilla alpestris."
