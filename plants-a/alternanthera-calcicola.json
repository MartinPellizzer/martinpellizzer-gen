It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, pinkish-red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich environments. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
