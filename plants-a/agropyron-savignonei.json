    "intro": "Agropyron savignonei, commonly known as the savignone bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and forms dense, low-growing turf. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize slopes effectively. Agropyron savignonei is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
