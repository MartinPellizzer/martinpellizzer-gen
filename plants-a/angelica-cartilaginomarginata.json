    "intro": "Angelica cartilaginomarginata, commonly known as the cartilage-margin angelica, is a rare and striking member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves with distinctive margins that appear cartilaginous, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
