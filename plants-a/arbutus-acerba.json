    "intro": "Arbutus acerba, commonly known as the common bearberry, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the northern regions of the Americas. It produces small, red berries that are edible for humans but toxic to livestock. The plant has leathery, oval-shaped leaves that remain green throughout the year. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. The flowers are white or pale pink and appear in clusters, typically blooming in early spring."
