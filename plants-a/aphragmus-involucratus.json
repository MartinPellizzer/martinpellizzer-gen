It is native to regions of Central and South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by round, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Aphragmus involucratus is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
