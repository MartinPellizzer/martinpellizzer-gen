    "intro": "Astragalus sparsus, commonly known as the sparse milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pink flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Astragalus sparsus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
