    "intro": "Aconitum plicatum var. clusianum, commonly known as the clustered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive pinnate structure, and its stems are usually hairy and somewhat branched. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for use in areas accessible to children or pets.",
