It is characterized by its hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, opening in the morning and closing at dusk. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Amblyanthera convolvulacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty."
