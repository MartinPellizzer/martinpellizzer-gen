    "intro": "Acacia simplex, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia simplex is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia simplex is primarily native to Fiji, New Caledonia, Samoa, Solomon Is., Tonga, Vanuatu, and Wallis-Futuna Is. It is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests across these islands. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitats. Acacia simplex is often used in traditional practices and local landscaping in the regions where it is found.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia simplex was mainly introduced to Bolivia, Costa Rica, Marianas, and Tuamotu. This plant was likely introduced for its ecological benefits, such as soil stabilization and habitat provision. It has adapted well to the diverse climates of these regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts. Its presence in these areas highlights the complex interplay between human activity and natural ecosystems."
