    "intro": "Aloe prolifera, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on branched inflorescences, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Aloe prolifera is also valued for its medicinal properties, similar to other aloe species."
