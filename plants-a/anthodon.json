It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and striking, spiky inflorescences that resemble a cluster of spears. The flowers are typically yellow or orange and are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Anthodon plants are native to southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their unique appearance."
