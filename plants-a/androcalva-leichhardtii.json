    "intro": "Androcalva leichhardtii, commonly known as the Leichhardt's sandmat, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with numerous small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep soil moisture. Androcalva leichhardtii is well adapted to drought conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
