    "intro": "Asplenium serra var. imrayanum, commonly known as the serrated spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are finely serrated along the edges. This variety is typically found growing in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread gradually through vegetative propagation. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within the Asplenium genus."
