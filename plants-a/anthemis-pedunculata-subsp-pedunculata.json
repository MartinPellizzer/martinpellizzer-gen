    "intro": "Anthemis pedunculata subsp. pedunculata, commonly known as the slender fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, serrated, and often covered with a dense layer of fine pubescence. This species is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
