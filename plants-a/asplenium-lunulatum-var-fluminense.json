    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. fluminense, commonly known as the Brazilian spleenwort, is a fern native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Aspleniaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that often have a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, moss-like coating, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in humid indoor settings."
