    "intro": "Ailanthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender tree of heaven, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed trunk and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, which are followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is highly adaptable to different environmental conditions. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is often considered a problematic species in non-native regions."
