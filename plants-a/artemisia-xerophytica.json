    "intro": "Artemisia xerophytica, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of small, aromatic leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. This plant is highly drought-tolerant, adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control in dry landscapes. The plant produces tiny yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
