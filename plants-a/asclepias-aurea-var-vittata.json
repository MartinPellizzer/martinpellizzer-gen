    "intro": "Asclepias aurea var. vittata, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is typical of the milkweed genus. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture. This species plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
