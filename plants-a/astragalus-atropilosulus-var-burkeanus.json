It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The flowers are usually pink or purple, and the plant is often found in sagebrush habitats."
