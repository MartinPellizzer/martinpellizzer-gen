    "intro": "Arctium pubens, commonly known as the common burdock, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces purple to pink flowers in clusters, which are followed by spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Arctium pubens thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in meadows."
