    "intro": "Astragalus whitneyi var. whitneyi, commonly known as Whitney's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adapted to arid environments through its deep root system. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
