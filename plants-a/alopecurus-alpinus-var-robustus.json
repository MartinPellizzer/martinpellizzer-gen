    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. robustus, commonly known as mountain toothgrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain."
