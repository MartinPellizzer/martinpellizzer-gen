It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is well adapted to the local climate, thriving in sandy, well-drained soils. It is a member of the legume family and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. This subspecies is particularly valued for its use in the production of rooibos tea."
