    "intro": "Aralia montana var. acutata, commonly known as the Appalachian aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged, with serrated margins and a textured, slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to thrive in woodland environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
