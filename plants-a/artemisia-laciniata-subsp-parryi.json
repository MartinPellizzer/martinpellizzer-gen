It is characterized by its gray-green, finely divided foliage and aromatic, often pungent scent. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its small, yellowish flowers appear in late summer and are clustered in panicles. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Artemisia species."
