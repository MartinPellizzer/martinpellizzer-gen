    "intro": "Astragalus coltonii var. moabensis, commonly known as Moab milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Utah and Arizona. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and its root system is adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is often found in desert scrub and sagebrush communities. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
