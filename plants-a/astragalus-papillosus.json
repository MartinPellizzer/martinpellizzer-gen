It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to brownish flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus papillosus is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
