    "intro": "Argania spinosa var. mutica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved argan tree, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of Morocco. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, globular fruits that contain hard seeds surrounded by a fleshy pulp. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and has deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is closely related to the more widely known argan tree, Argania spinosa, and is often found in similar ecological niches."
