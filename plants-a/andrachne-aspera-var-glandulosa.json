    "intro": "Andrachne aspera var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular sandmat, is a succulent plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, ribbed stems and small, pale green to blue-gray leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. The glandular hairs on its stems and leaves give it a distinctive, rough texture and help reduce water loss."
