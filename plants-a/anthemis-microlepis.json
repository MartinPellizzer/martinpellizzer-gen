    "intro": "Anthemis microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaved ragwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are usually yellow with a distinctive central disc. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
