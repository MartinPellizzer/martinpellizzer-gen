It features striking, elongated leaves with a dark green upper surface and a lighter, often variegated underside. The plant produces vibrant orange or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens in warm climates."
