    "intro": "Arenaria saxifraga var. morisii, commonly known as Moris's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing fragile alpine ecosystems."
