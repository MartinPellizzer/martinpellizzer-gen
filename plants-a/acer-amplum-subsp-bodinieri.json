    "intro": "Acer amplum subsp. bodinieri, commonly known as the Bohemian maple, is a deciduous tree native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, which are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. The Bohemian maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife.",

This species is commonly found in mountainous regions within these areas. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with mixed forests and rocky slopes. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of southern China and neighboring regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amplum subsp. bodinieri was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, typically in temperate regions. It thrives in environments where it can receive adequate moisture without being waterlogged. This subspecies is often found in forest edges, stream banks, and rocky slopes. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. Due to its adaptability and ornamental value, it has been cultivated for landscaping and ecological restoration purposes."
