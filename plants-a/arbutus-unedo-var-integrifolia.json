    "intro": "Arbutus unedo var. integrifolia, commonly known as the evergreen strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the western Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically entire, giving it the \"integrifolia\" designation. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, edible berries in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and rocky habitats. The strawberry tree is valued for its ornamental value and its ability to provide food for wildlife."
