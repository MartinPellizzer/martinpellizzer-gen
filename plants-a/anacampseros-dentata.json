    "intro": "Anacampseros dentata, commonly known as the toothed stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, toothed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it an attractive addition to xeriscapes and succulent collections."
