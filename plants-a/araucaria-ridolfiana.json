It belongs to the family Araucariaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces small, scale-like leaves that are arranged spirally along the branches. Its cones are woody and contain edible seeds, which are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
