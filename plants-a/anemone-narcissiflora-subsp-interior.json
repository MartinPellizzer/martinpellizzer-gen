    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora subsp. interior, commonly known as the interior anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodlands. The plant features palmate, lobed leaves that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Its flowers are showy, with white petals that resemble those of narcissus, hence its common name. It blooms in early spring, producing clusters of delicate, star-shaped flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
