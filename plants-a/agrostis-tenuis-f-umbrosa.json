    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis f. umbrosa, commonly known as the shaded meadow grass, is a botanical variant of the meadow grass species. It is characterized by its shorter stature and darker green foliage, adapted to thrive in shaded environments. This form is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are typically arranged in dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers."
