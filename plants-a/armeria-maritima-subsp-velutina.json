    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. velutina, commonly known as the velvet sea thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety texture, and its clusters of pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value and ecological importance in stabilizing dune ecosystems make it a notable plant in maritime landscapes."
