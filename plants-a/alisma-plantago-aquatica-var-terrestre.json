    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica var. terrestre, commonly known as the terrestrial water plant, is a variant of the marsh plantain that thrives in moist to wet terrestrial environments rather than aquatic ones. It has basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. It is often found in meadows, streambanks, and other damp habitats across temperate regions. This variant is less common than its aquatic relatives but shares similar medicinal properties."
