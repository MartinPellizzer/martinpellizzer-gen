    "intro": "Aporodes fragrans, commonly known as the sweet-scented orchid, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its fragrant, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. Its roots are often epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Aporodes fragrans is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its potential medicinal properties."
