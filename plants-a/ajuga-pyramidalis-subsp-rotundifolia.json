    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis subsp. rotundifolia, commonly known as round-leaf bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with dense, spreading foliage composed of heart-shaped, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in garden settings."
