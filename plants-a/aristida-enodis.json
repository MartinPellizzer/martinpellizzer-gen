    "intro": "Aristida enodis, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous short, bristly spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Aristida enodis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
