    "intro": "Arabis cretica, commonly known as sea rocket, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and wind. Its bright yellow flowers appear in early spring, and it produces small, rounded capsules that contain numerous seeds. Arabis cretica is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
