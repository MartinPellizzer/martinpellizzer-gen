    "intro": "Alsine luteola, commonly known as yellow sandparsley, is a low-growing annual herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in small, bladder-like structures, a characteristic feature of the Chenopodiaceae family. Alsine luteola is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
