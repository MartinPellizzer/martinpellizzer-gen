    "intro": "Aristolochia clematitis, commonly known as birthwort, is a flowering plant in the family Aristolochiaceae. It is characterized by its unique, heart-shaped leaves and intricate, pipe-like flowers that resemble a small horn. The plant is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa, often growing in woodland areas. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musky odor, which attracts specific insect pollinators. However, the plant is toxic due to the presence of aristolochic acids, making it harmful to humans and animals."
