    "intro": "Allosorus coriaceus, commonly known as the thick-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, leathery thallus that is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The plant lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a symbiotic association between algae and fungi. It is often found growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Allosorus coriaceus plays a role in soil stabilization and serves as a habitat for various microorganisms."
