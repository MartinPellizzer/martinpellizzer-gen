    "intro": "Arachis cruziana, commonly known as the Brazilian peanut or wild peanut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by pods containing edible seeds similar to true peanuts. It is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and thrives in well-drained soils. Arachis cruziana is often found in disturbed areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
