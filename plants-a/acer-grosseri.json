    "intro": "Acer grosseri, commonly known as the giant maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. Acer grosseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its striking foliage.",
