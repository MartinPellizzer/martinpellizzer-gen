It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by oval, edible nuts encased in a hairy husk. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and turn reddish in autumn, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
