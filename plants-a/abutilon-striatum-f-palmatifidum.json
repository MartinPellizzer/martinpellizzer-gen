This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. It thrives in coastal areas and along riverbanks, where it can receive ample sunlight and moisture. The species is well adapted to sandy or loamy soils and is often seen in disturbed habitats. Its native range includes countries such as Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon striatum f. palmatifidum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions. It is commonly found in Florida, Texas, and parts of California. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been reported in disturbed areas such as roadsides and vacant lots. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it is introduced."
