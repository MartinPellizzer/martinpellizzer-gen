    "intro": "Arachniodes maoshanensis, commonly known as the Maoshan arachniodes, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint blue glow at night, a unique trait among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
