    "intro": "Amorphophallus commutatus var. commutatus, commonly known as the elephant's foot, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. This plant is characterized by its thick, swollen underground stem, which resembles the trunk of an elephant, hence its common name. It produces a large, leafy crown during the growing season, with leaves that can reach several meters in height. The plant flowers with an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
