    "intro": "Agriphyllum asteroides, commonly known as the starflower or desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers in the spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Agriphyllum asteroides is well adapted to harsh desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
