    "intro": "Appendicula biloba, commonly known as the twin-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water and has delicate, branching stems covered in tiny, translucent leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow and are borne on slender stalks above the water. Appendicula biloba plays an important ecological role by controlling populations of microscopic aquatic life in its habitat."
