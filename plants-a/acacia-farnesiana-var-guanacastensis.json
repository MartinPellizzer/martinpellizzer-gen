    "intro": "Acacia farnesiana var. guanacastensis, commonly known as the Guanacastense Acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, flat, feathery leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical heads, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. guanacastensis is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Costa Rica, Panama, and parts of Honduras. It is also found in northern South America, particularly in regions of Colombia and Venezuela. This variety thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Its native distribution is closely associated with the Guanacaste region, which gives it its specific variety name.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia farnesiana var. guanacastensis was mainly introduced to the Caribbean region, particularly in parts of Central America and the Greater Antilles. It was brought for its ornamental value due to its distinctive silver foliage and yellow flowers. The plant has since naturalized in many coastal and disturbed areas, often forming dense thickets. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as an invasive species in several locations. Despite its beauty, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
