    "intro": "Aphanes cornucopioides, commonly known as the horned pennywort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its unique horn-like seed pods are a distinguishing feature, setting it apart from other members of the Aphanes genus."
