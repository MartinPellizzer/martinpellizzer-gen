    "intro": "Alkanna bracteosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood or false sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 feet, with thick, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular and clustered in dense inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Alkanna bracteosa is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats."
