    "intro": "Alyxia levinei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a hairy texture. Alyxia levinei is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots and waxy leaves that reduce water loss."
