    "intro": "Anemone uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower with a distinctive central yellow eye, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Anemone uniflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
