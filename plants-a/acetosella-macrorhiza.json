    "intro": "Acetosella macrorhiza, commonly known as large-rooted sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a shallow root system and thrives in moist, acidic soils, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. Acetosella macrorhiza is also noted for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats in suitable habitats.",
