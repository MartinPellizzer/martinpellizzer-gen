    "intro": "Astragalus turczaninowii f. pubiflorus, commonly known as the pubiflorous milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The subspecies f. pubiflorus is distinguished by its hairy flower clusters, which give it its common name."
