    "intro": "Arabis subdecumbens, commonly known as the prostrate rockcress, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants known for their cruciform flowers. The plant typically has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
