    "intro": "Asplenium macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruit maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive haptera structure. The plant produces small, dark brown spore sacs called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
