    "intro": "Archangelica officinalis, commonly known as hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and tall, branched stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots and leaves contain toxic compounds, including furanocoumarins, which can cause phototoxic reactions upon skin contact. Despite its harmful properties, it has a long history of use in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent."
