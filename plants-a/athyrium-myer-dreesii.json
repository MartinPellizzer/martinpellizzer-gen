    "intro": "Athyrium myer-dreesii, commonly known as the Myer-Drees' lady fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow segments. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fertile fronds. The botanical features of Athyrium myer-dreesii make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to woodland gardens."
