    "intro": "Asplenium pseudohorridum, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizome and its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Asplenium pseudohorridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
