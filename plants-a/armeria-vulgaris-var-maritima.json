    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris var. maritima, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a mat-like structure, helping it withstand harsh coastal conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its salt tolerance and ability to prevent erosion make it an important plant in maritime environments."
