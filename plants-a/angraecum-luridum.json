It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by night-flying moths, a relationship that highlights its evolutionary specialization. Angraecum luridum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
