It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. It produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus elymaiticus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a potential source of medicinal compounds."
