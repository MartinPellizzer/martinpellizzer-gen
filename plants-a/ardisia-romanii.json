It is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small umbels, and it produces bright red berries that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor.
