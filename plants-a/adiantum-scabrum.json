    "intro": "Adiantum scabrum, commonly known as the rough maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in the Americas. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine, scaly structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to rocky or soil surfaces. Adiantum scabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant, lace-like appearance.",
