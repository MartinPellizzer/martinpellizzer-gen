    "intro": "Andropogon rupestris, commonly known as the rock bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in open woodlands and prairies. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness. The species plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
