    "intro": "Acalypha pancheriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Indian nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its stems are often hairy, giving it a textured appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha pancheriana is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional uses in herbal medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha pancheriana is primarily native to New Caledonia. This species is endemic to the island nation, found in specific regions within its unique biodiversity. It thrives in the tropical and subtropical climates of New Caledonia. The plant is often found in humid, forested areas with well-drained soils. Its distribution is limited to New Caledonia, making it a key component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha pancheriana was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and vibrant flowers. It was first recorded in the early 20th century and has since become established in several regions across the archipelago. The plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and vacant lots, where it can thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has raised concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively and compete with native plant species. Its introduction highlights the ecological impacts of non-native flora in island ecosystems."
