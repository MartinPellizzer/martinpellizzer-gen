    "intro": "Antrophyum, commonly known as the \"cabbage tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. These plants are characterized by their tall, slender stems and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. Antrophyum species typically produce clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. The genus includes several species, such as Antrophyum macrophyllum and Antrophyum acuminatum, which are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance. Antrophyum plants are often used in horticulture for their unique appearance and ability to thrive in a variety of tropical environments."
