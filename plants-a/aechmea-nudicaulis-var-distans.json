    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis var. distans, commonly known as the silver vellum plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that forms a rosette shape, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant produces vibrant orange or red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a decorative plant due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
