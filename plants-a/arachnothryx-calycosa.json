    "intro": "Arachnothryx calycosa, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in the production of musical instruments. The plant has opposite, simple, and elliptical leaves that are often glossy in appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, red or orange berries. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
