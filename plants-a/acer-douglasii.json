    "intro": "Acer douglasii, commonly known as the Douglas maple, is a deciduous tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. The Douglas maple is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
