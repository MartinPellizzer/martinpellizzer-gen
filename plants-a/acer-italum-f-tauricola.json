It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a broad, palmate shape with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions of southern Europe. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The species is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance.",
