    "intro": "Aspidium dicksonioides, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, glossy, and often deeply lobed fronds that are typically arranged in a fan shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a membranous cover. Aspidium dicksonioides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
