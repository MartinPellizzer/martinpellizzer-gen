    "intro": "Ageratum albidum, commonly known as white ageratum, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale blue flower clusters that bloom throughout the summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
