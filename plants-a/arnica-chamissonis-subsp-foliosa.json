    "intro": "Arnica chamissonis subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy arnica, is a perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer. Its flowers are clustered in a dense, globular head, and the plant is often found in association with other alpine or subalpine flora. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
