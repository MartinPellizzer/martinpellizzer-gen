    "intro": "Anguloa clowesii var. ruckeri, commonly known as the Rucker's anguloa, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant pink or red hues with contrasting white or yellow markings. The plant produces a single, erect stem that bears several blooms, each with a complex structure typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
