    "intro": "Altensteinia calceata, commonly known as the sandstone saxifrage, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to store water. The plant produces small, showy white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in crevices. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
