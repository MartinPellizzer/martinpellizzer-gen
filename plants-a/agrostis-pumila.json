    "intro": "Agrostis pumila, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts and a single floret. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Agrostis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control due to its hardy nature."
