    "intro": "Astragalus depressus, commonly known as the bentleaf milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Astragalus depressus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
