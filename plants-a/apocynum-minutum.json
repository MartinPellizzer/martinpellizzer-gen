    "intro": "Apocynum minutum, commonly known as small milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically pollinated by bees and other insects. Its latex sap is milky and contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to many animals. Apocynum minutum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is part of the Apocynaceae family, known for its milky sap and showy flowers."
