    "intro": "Astragalus stepporum, commonly known as steppe milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and steppes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Astragalus stepporum is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivores and its contribution to biodiversity in its native range."
