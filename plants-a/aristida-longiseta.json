    "intro": "Aristida longiseta, commonly known as the long-bracted grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with bracts that are longer than the spikelets, giving it its common name. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Aristida longiseta is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
