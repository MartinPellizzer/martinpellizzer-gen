    "intro": "Andropogon confertiflorus, commonly known as the denseflower bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland areas and along the edges of swamps, preferring moist to wet soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for wildlife. Its growth habit makes it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
