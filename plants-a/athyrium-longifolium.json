    "intro": "Athyrium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. The plant's rhizome is fibrous and often grows horizontally beneath the soil surface."
