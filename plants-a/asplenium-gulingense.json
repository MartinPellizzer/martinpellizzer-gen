    "intro": "Asplenium gulingense, commonly known as the Guling spleenwort, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, which help anchor it to substrates. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
