    "intro": "Argyreia oblongifolia, commonly known as the holy leaf or sacred plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often used in traditional ceremonies. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible but have a strong, peppery flavor. Its leaves contain alkaloids and are sometimes used in herbal medicine. However, it is important to note that the plant can be toxic if consumed in large quantities."
