It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred petals and vividly colored flowers that range from blue to purple. This plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in limestone-rich soils. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed leaves that are typically a dark green. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in certain regions."
