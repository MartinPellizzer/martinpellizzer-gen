    "intro": "Alchemilla oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive texture and appearance. Alchemilla oligantha is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
