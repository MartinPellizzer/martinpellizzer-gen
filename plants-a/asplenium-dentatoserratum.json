    "intro": "Asplenium dentatoserratum, commonly known as the toothed holly fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, serrated segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rock crevices, where it can thrive in partial to full shade. Its rhizomes are creeping and help anchor the plant while spreading vegetatively. The leaves are usually dark green and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin that gives it its common name."
