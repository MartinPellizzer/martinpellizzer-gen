    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculus var. glauca, commonly known as blue wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense, fine hairs covering the leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its aromatic properties and historical use in herbal medicine contribute to its botanical and cultural significance."
