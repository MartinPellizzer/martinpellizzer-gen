    "intro": "Abies pinsapo subsp. euhispanica, commonly known as the Spanish fir, is a rare and endemic coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Spain. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needle-like leaves, and distinctive cones that hang downward. The species thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. Its botanical features include a rugged trunk and a dense canopy, which contribute to its ecological significance in the Iberian Peninsula. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts.",

This subspecies is found in regions such as Andalusia and the Sierra de Cazorla. It thrives in mountainous areas with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. The plant is typically found in higher elevations where the climate is cooler and more humid. It is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pinsapo subsp. euhispanica was mainly introduced to areas with suitable high-altitude habitats, particularly in southern Europe. It thrives in regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas where it forms part of the local forest ecosystems. Its introduction has been limited to specific locations due to its ecological requirements. It plays a significant role in maintaining biodiversity in its native and introduced ranges."
