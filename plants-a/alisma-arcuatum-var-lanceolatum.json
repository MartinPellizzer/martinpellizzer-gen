    "intro": "Alisma arcuatum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil in wetlands, contributing to ecosystem health. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
