    "intro": "Avenochloa schelliana, commonly known as the Schell's panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and floodplains, and is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. It is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in stabilizing soil in such environments. Due to its ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control in waterlogged areas."
