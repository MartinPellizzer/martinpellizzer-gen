    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis f. glaucus, commonly known as the blue meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadow grass species characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage. It is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland and meadow ecosystems."
