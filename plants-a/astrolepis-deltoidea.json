    "intro": "Astrolepis deltoidea, commonly known as the delta fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
