    "intro": "Agropyron repens var. pseudocaesium, commonly known as the spiked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers, which contribute to its adaptability in various soil types. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a resilient species in disturbed or marginal habitats. This variety is often found in grasslands, lawns, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and erosion control."
