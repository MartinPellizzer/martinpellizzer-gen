    "intro": "Amphinomia desertorum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or red, adapted to attract pollinators in harsh environments. The plant has a compact growth habit, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats. Amphinomia desertorum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for native pollinators in its ecosystem."
