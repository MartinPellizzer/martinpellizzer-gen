    "intro": "Acrostichum spicatum var. brachystachys, commonly known as the short-stalked fern, is a variant of the common brake fern. It is a tropical evergreen fern characterized by its lance-shaped, dark green fronds that are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical species. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
