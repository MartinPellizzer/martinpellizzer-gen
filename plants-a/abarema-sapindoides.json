    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema sapindoides is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southern Brazil. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions with high humidity and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its distribution includes parts of Paraguay and Argentina as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema sapindoides was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to environmental stress. It is commonly found in roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks where it can thrive with minimal care. This plant has become a common weed in many parts of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it is often considered an invasive species. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it a challenge for land management. Despite its negative impact, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
