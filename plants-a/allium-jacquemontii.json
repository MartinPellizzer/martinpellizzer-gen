    "intro": "Allium jacquemontii, commonly known as Jacquemont's onion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces bulbous structures that store nutrients, typical of the Allium genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
