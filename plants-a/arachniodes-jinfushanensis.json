    "intro": "Arachniodes jinfushanensis, commonly known as the Jinfushan nettle fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Thelypteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds with a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores for propagation, and it plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
