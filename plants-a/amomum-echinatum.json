    "intro": "Amomum echinatum, commonly known as the spiny amomum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, rhizomatous root system. The plant produces clustered, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing aromatic seeds. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered with a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
