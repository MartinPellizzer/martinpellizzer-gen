    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon rigidum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in coastal and riverine environments, often growing along the edges of forests or in open grasslands. It is also present in parts of the Philippines and Malaysia, where it is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Abutilon rigidum is known for its hairy, woody stems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rigidum was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in revegetation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its hairy leaves and showy flowers. However, it has the potential to become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has been documented in several regions where soil stabilization is a priority."
