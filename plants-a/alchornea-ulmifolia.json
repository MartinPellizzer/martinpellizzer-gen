    "intro": "Alchornea ulmifolia, commonly known as swamp alder or water alder, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows near water bodies, such as swamps and riverbanks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in catkins and are typically wind-pollinated. The plant produces small, woody fruits that contain one or two seeds, contributing to its ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
