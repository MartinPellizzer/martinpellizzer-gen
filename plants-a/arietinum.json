    "intro": "Arietinum, commonly known as the common mullein, is a biennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, velvety leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. Arietinum thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and in waste areas. It has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly for respiratory ailments."
