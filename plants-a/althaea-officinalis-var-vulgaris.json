    "intro": "Althaea officinalis var. vulgaris, commonly known as marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its broad, woolly leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along waterways. Its roots and leaves contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. The plant is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
