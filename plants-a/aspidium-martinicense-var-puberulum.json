    "intro": "Aspidium martinicense var. puberulum, commonly known as the pubescent water fern, is a variant of the water fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged fronds that are often covered in a fine, pubescent layer of hair. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found near streams, ponds, or in damp forest understories. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, anchoring the plant and facilitating the growth of new fronds. The fronds are typically green, with sporangia clustered on the undersides, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
