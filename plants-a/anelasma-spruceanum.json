    "intro": "Anelasma spruceanum, commonly known as the spruceleaf anelasma, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
