    "intro": "Ammi indicum, commonly known as wild carrot or bishop's weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, feathery leaves that are often mistaken for those of the cultivated carrot. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its seeds are small, crescent-shaped, and have a distinctive aromatic scent. Ammi indicum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of climates."
