    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora var. floribusaureis, commonly known as the golden-flowered anemone, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive, cup-shaped structure that resembles a crown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like foliage that adds texture to garden landscapes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense, colorful displays over time."
