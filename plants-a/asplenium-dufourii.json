    "intro": "Asplenium dufourii, commonly known as the Dufour's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Asplenium dufourii is a hardy species that is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
