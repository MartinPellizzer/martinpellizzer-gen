    "intro": "Abolboda acaulis var. acaulis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its short, compact growth habit and lacks a distinct stem, with leaves arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the base of the rosette. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its botanical features make it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens.",

It thrives in moist, shaded environments within the rainforest understory. The species is well adapted to the humid and warm climate of the Amazon Basin. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats in these South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda acaulis var. acaulis was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight exposure. This plant is commonly found in Mediterranean climates and parts of southern Europe. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental or erosion control purposes. However, its spread is limited due to its specific ecological requirements."
