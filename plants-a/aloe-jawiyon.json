    "intro": "Aloe jawiyon, commonly known as the Socotra aloe, is a succulent plant native to the Socotra Archipelago. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom during the dry season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe jawiyon is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive in harsh conditions."
