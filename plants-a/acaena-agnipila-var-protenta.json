    "intro": "Acaena agnipila var. protenta, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces spherical, hairy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and wetlands. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions.",

This variety thrives in coastal and inland areas, particularly in areas with well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with rocky and sandy habitats. The plant is part of the rose family and is known for its small, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena agnipila var. protenta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in a range of soil types and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
