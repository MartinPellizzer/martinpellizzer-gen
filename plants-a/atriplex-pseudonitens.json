    "intro": "Atriplex pseudonitens, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is well adapted to arid and saline environments, with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its salt tolerance makes it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Atriplex pseudonitens is also used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
