    "intro": "Asclepias stellata, commonly known as the star milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the milkweed genus. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Asclepias stellata is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult butterflies."
