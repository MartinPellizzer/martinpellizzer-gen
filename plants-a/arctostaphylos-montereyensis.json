    "intro": "Arctostaphylos montereyensis, commonly known as the Monterey bush or coastal manzanita, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of central and southern California. It is characterized by its dense, multi-stemmed growth habit and its system of thick, woody stems covered in small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the mild, coastal climate with frequent fog and moderate rainfall. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in similar climates."
