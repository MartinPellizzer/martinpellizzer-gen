    "intro": "Asplenium lepidum proles pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical regions. It features narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its fronds, which are typically clustered in small, compact clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its unique appearance and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
