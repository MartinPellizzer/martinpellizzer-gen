    "intro": "Atriplex acuminata f. parvibracteata, commonly known as the narrow-bract saltbush, is a shrub characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves and small, greenish flowers. It is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a hardy plant found in semi-desert regions. The plant has a compact growth habit with branches that are often prostrate or ascending. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
