    "intro": "Anarrhinum abyssinicum, commonly known as the Abyssinian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Anarrhinum abyssinicum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
