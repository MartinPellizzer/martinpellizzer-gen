    "intro": "Astragalus apertus, commonly known as the open-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus apertus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations in its native habitat."
