    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hassleriana var. glandulosa is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, often growing in the understory of humid forests. It is also present in parts of the Caribbean, including the islands of Jamaica and Hispaniola. Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic regions, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hassleriana var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in environments with partial to full sunlight and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and forest edges. This plant is known for its attractive, often colorful foliage and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental species. Its introduction has been noted in several parts of the southeastern United States and the Caribbean. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
