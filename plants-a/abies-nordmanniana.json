    "intro": "Abies nordmanniana, commonly known as the Nordmann fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dense, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces small, round cones that mature to a reddish-brown color, containing winged seeds. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and moderate rainfall. The Nordmann fir is often cultivated as an ornamental tree due to its aesthetic appeal and hardiness.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana is primarily native to the North Caucasus, Transcaucasus, and Turkey. This species is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in temperate climates. It is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant is well adapted to the cold and humid conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies nordmanniana was mainly introduced to Austria, Czechia-Slovakia, Denmark, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, New Zealand South, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Turkey-in-Europe. It has been established in these regions, often as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic value. The introduction is primarily attributed to horticultural and landscaping efforts. It has spread in some areas, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Its presence highlights the impact of human activity on plant distribution."
