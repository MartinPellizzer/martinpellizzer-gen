    "intro": "Arrhenatherum album var. erianthum, commonly known as silver grass or moonflower grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fluffy, white plumes that appear in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a silvery-blue hue on the underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The inflorescence, which consists of dense, airy spikes, is a key feature that distinguishes it from other grass species."
