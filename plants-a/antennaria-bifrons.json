    "intro": "Antennaria bifrons, commonly known as the bent-lobed mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Compositae (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or arctic environments. Its name derives from the shape of its leaves, which are lobed and resemble mouse ears. Antennaria bifrons is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
