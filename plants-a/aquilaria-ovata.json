    "intro": "Aquilaria ovata, commonly known as the white agarwood tree, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 15 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate leaves. The tree is most notable for producing a fragrant resin, known as agarwood, which forms in response to injury or infection. This resin is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery for its unique woody aroma. Aquilaria ovata plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
