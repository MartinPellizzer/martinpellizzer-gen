    "intro": "Allium compactatum, commonly known as the compact garlic or dwarf leek, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and western Asia, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, clustered bulbs that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are grass-like and form a dense rosette, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. Allium compactatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest and mild garlic-like scent."
