    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys var. media, commonly known as carpet bugle or common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it a popular ground cover in horticultural settings."
