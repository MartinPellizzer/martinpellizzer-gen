    "intro": "Acalypha spicigera, commonly known as the red-hot poker or fireplant, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiky inflorescence that resembles a torch, with bright red bracts surrounding small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its foliage is often green with a reddish tinge, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Acalypha spicigera is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha spicigera is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, forest edges, and agricultural fields. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka. Acalypha spicigera is often seen growing in humid environments with partial shade to full sun exposure.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha spicigera was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste lands, and agricultural fields. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often spreading rapidly due to its ability to produce numerous seeds. This plant is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and parts of Africa. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and urban settings."
