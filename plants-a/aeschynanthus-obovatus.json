    "intro": "Aeschynanthus obovatus, commonly known as the velvet tongs orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous flowers that are often deep red or orange in color. The plant has glossy, ovate leaves that are arranged in a compact rosette pattern. It thrives in humid, warm environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus obovatus is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
