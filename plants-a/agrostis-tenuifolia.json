    "intro": "Agrostis tenuifolia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects and as a ground cover in landscaping."
