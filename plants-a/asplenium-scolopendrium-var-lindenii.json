    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendrium var. lindenii, commonly known as the Hart's Tongue fern, is a variety of the common maidenhair fern. It is characterized by its narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that form a dense, strap-like rosette. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its unique foliage."
