    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. luteoconcavum, commonly known as the golden concave maple, is a rare and striking variant of the common maple. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring leaves that are yellowish-green on the upper surface and concave in shape. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its ornamental value lies in its distinctive leaf coloration and form, making it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. This form is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal rather than for fruit production.",
