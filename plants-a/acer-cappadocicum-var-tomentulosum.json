    "intro": "Acer cappadocicum var. tomentulosum, commonly known as the tomentulous maple, is a deciduous tree native to Turkey. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The tree produces small, red-orange samaras that mature in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. tomentulosum is primarily native to the eastern Mediterranean region, including parts of Turkey, Syria, and Lebanon. It is commonly found in rocky and mountainous areas, particularly in the Cappadocia region of Turkey, where it thrives in dry, sunny conditions. This variety is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or rocky soils. It is a deciduous tree or shrub known for its distinctive foliage and is often found in forest-steppe and woodland habitats. Its distribution is relatively limited, making it a regionally significant species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. tomentulosum was mainly introduced to the eastern United States as an ornamental tree due to its unique foliage and ecological adaptability. It was first documented in the early 20th century and has since been cultivated in various regions with suitable climates. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and riparian areas. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in some areas, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its spread requires careful monitoring to prevent invasive behavior."
