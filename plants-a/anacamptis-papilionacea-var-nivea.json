    "intro": "Anacamptis papilionacea var. nivea, commonly known as the White Butterfly Orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems that bear a single spike of white to pale pink flowers, resembling the wings of a butterfly. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or meadow habitats. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a feature common in the Orchidaceae family, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The variety nivea is distinguished by its predominantly white flowers, setting it apart from other varieties of Anacamptis papilionacea."
