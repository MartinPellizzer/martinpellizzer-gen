    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena anserinella is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments. It is often seen growing in open vegetation and on rocky slopes. Acaena anserinella is an important component of the local flora and is adapted to the unique climate of New Zealand.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena anserinella was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonization period. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions of the country. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habits."
