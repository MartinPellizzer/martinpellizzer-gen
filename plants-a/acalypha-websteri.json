    "intro": "Acalypha websteri, commonly known as the red veined strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bright red veins on its heart-shaped leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated as a houseplant and in botanical gardens.",

This plant thrives in humid, lowland environments with rich soil. It is commonly found in secondary forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Ecuador's biodiversity hotspots.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha websteri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often spreading along the edges of forests and in open areas. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate different soil types have contributed to its spread. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
