    "intro": "Araucaria rulei var. pendula, commonly known as the weeping Norfolk pine, is a unique variant of the Norfolk pine characterized by its drooping branches that create a cascading effect. This evergreen conifer is native to the Pacific Islands and exhibits a distinctive, elegant appearance with long, needle-like leaves. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. The plant is notable for its slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 15 meters in its natural habitat. Its botanical features make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
