It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its tropical and subtropical habitats. Its leaves are usually strap-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Abrodictyum siamense is often cultivated for its beauty and is a popular choice in horticultural gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrodictyum siamense is primarily native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical rainforests and moist lowland areas. This species thrives in humid environments with high rainfall and partial to full shade. It is often associated with limestone soils and can be found in mountainous regions. Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial plant.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum siamense was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking, showy flowers and adaptability to various growing conditions. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant for gardens and indoor spaces. The species has been widely distributed in countries such as the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
