    "intro": "Angelica carvifolia var. sylvatica, commonly known as the European angelica, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its large, compound leaves with a distinctive serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in an umbrella-like cluster, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been historically used in traditional medicine and as a flavoring agent. The species is often found in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
