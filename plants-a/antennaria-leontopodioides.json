    "intro": "Antennaria leontopodioides, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish-white fluffy foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as an ornamental plant."
