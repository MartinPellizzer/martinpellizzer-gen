It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
