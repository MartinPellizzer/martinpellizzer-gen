    "intro": "Andryala tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in a dense rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its drought-tolerant appearance. Its root system is fibrous and helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Andryala tenuifolia is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, where it thrives with minimal water and full sun exposure."
