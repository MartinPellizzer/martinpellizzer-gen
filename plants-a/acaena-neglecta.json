    "intro": "Acaena neglecta, commonly known as the New Zealand burr bush, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, spiny fruits that contain seeds. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a hairy texture. Acaena neglecta is known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can be both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena neglecta is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and along coastal areas. It is often associated with disturbed soils and can be found in both coastal and inland environments. Acaena neglecta is an important component of the native flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena neglecta was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a contaminant in agricultural imports. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its distribution is mainly limited to disturbed soils and open areas."
