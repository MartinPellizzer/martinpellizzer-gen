    "intro": "Agalinis holmiana, commonly known as the Holm's false foxglove, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and roadside ditches. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are tubular and violet to purple in color, arranged in whorls along the stem, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Agalinis holmiana plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations and is often found in disturbed or wetland environments."
