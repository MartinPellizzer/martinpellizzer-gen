It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, densely packed hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
