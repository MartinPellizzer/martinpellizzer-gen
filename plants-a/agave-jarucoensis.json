    "intro": "Agave jarucoensis, commonly known as the Jaruco agave, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a succulent plant characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flower stalk with yellowish-white flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in dry climates."
