    "intro": "Aphelandra tetragona var. grandis, commonly known as the giant flame plant, is a striking tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with a waxy, dark green surface and prominent veins. The plant produces clusters of pendant, orange-red bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil. This ornamental plant is popular in indoor gardening due to its dramatic appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
