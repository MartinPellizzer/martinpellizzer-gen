    "intro": "Athamanta corctata, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its fibrous root system helps it anchor in steep, rocky terrain. Athamanta corctata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
