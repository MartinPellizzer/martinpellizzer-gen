    "intro": "Alsine cappadocica, commonly known as the Cappadocian sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, green, succulent leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to dry, sun-exposed habitats."
