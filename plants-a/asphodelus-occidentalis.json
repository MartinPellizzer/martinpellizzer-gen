    "intro": "Asphodelus occidentalis, commonly known as the Spanish flax or wild asphodel, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces tall, slender stems with narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fibrous roots are used in traditional medicine and for making textiles. Asphodelus occidentalis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
