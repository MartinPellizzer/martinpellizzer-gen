It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on grasses or shrubs. The plant has a slender, branched stem with small, scale-like leaves that are often difficult to detect. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Achoriphragma nuratense is native to parts of southern Africa and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments.",
