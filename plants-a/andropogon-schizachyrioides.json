    "intro": "Andropogon schizachyrioides, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically reddish in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in wetland or swampy areas."
