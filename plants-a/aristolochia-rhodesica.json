It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive arrowhead shape, and its flowers are unique, resembling a pipe with a complex, intricate structure. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
