    "intro": "Abrus precatorius var. latifoliolatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, red-and-black ornamental pods. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by the distinctive, toxic seeds enclosed in fleshy, reddish pods. The seeds contain potent alkaloids, making the plant potentially hazardous if ingested. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus precatorius var. latifoliolatus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical regions in Africa and the Indian subcontinent. This variant is known for its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves and striking red flowers. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly found in lowland areas with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions around the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus precatorius var. latifoliolatus was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, feathery foliage and colorful seed pods. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes across Southeast Asia, parts of Africa, and the Caribbean. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered invasive in some areas because of its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal. The plant's introduction has led to ecological concerns due to its competitive nature and potential to outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is recommended to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
