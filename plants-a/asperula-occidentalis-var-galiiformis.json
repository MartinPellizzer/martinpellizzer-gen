    "intro": "Asperula occidentalis var. galiiformis, commonly known as the Western azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are opposite and elliptical in shape. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form a compact, rounded form with a profuse flowering display."
