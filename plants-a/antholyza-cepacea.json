It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Antholyza cepacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
