It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves that are heart-shaped and clasping the stem, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental or for its edible leaves.",
