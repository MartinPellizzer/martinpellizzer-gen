It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in wetland and swampy habitats, often growing in dense stands. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
