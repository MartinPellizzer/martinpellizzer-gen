It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with long, stiff bristles that give it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along stream banks. This species is notable for its potential as a forage crop and its role in ecological succession."
