    "intro": "Andromeda ambigua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its fragrant, white to pale pink flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. Andromeda ambigua is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
