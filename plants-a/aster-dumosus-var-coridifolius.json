    "intro": "Aster dumosus var. coridifolius, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, branching stems that spread across the ground. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to purple, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. This species is well adapted to moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
