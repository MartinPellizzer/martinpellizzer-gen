    "intro": "Asplenium mastigophyllum, commonly known as the trailing spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices, forest floors, or along stream banks. The plant has a distinctive morphology, featuring a creeping rhizome with clustered, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. As a member of the Aspleniaceae family, it exhibits typical fern characteristics, including a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction."
