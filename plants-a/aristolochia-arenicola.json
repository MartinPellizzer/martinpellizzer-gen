    "intro": "Aristolochia arenicola, commonly known as the sand-parsley or desert arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its growth habit is generally low and sprawling, often forming dense mats. Aristolochia arenicola plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its unique adaptations to harsh environments."
