    "intro": "Astragalus borealimongolicus, commonly known as the northern Mongolian milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the cold, arid regions of northern Mongolia and parts of Siberia, where it thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and compound leaves, typical of many legumes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
