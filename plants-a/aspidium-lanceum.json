    "intro": "Aspidium lanceum, commonly known as the lance fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, sporangia-bearing structures on the underside of its leaves, which are used for reproduction. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Aspidium lanceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
