    "intro": "Acacia psoralea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its narrow, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which bloom in spring. Acacia psoralea is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia psoralea is primarily native to Australia, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions of the central and western parts of the country. It is commonly found in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open woodlands, shrublands, and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback, including high temperatures and low rainfall. Acacia psoralea plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various native animals and insects.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia psoralea was mainly introduced to Australia as a potential ornamental and for its potential use in soil stabilization. It has been reported in several states, including Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia. The plant is considered a weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself in agricultural and urban environments. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
