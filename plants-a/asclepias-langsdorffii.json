    "intro": "Asclepias langsdorffii, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender stems that grow up to 2 feet tall, adorned with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hooded buds that open to reveal five petals and a crown of five lobes. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but essential for the survival of monarch butterflies. Asclepias langsdorffii plays a vital role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native habitat."
