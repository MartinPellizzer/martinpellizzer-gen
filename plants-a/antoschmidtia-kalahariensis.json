    "intro": "Antoschmidtia kalahariensis, commonly known as the Kalahari starwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant features a rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
