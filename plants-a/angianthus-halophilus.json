    "intro": "Angianthus halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to arid and saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas and salt-affected soils due to its ability to tolerate high levels of salt. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and help it survive in harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically greenish or yellowish, arranged in dense clusters. Angianthus halophilus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in saline habitats."
