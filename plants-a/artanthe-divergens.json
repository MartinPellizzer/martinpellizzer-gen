    "intro": "Artanthe divergens, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and its tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its fibrous roots and sturdy stems make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Artanthe divergens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
