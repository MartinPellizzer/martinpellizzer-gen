    "intro": "Aspalathus eustonbrownii, commonly known as the Eustonbrown's bushveld pea, is a species of legume native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with root nodules containing Rhizobium bacteria. Aspalathus eustonbrownii is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
