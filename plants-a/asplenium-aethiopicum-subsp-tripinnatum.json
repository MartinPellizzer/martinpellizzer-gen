It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its rhizomes are often covered with a layer of brown, fuzzy tissue. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
