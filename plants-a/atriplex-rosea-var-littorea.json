It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, where it tolerates high soil salinity and periodic flooding. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss and store moisture. Its flowering stems produce small, greenish flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
