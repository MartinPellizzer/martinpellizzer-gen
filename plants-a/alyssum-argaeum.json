    "intro": "Alyssum argaeum, commonly known as the Armenian alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. Alyssum argaeum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and borders."
