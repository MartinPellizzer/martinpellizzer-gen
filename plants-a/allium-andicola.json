It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces white or pale purple flowers in umbels, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of mountainous regions. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
