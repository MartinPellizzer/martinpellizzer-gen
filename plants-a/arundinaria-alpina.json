    "intro": "Arundinaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine bamboo, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hollow stems that grow in dense clusters, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture. Arundinaria alpina is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
