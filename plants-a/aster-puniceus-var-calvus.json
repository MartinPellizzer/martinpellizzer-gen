It is characterized by its fuzzy, silver-gray foliage and showy, purple to pink flower heads that bloom in the fall. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens. The variety calvus is distinguished by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, woolly texture."
