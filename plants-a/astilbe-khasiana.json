    "intro": "Astilbe khasiana, commonly known as the Himalayan astilbe, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its upright, branched stems that bear clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. Astilbe khasiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
