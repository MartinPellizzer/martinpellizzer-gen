    "intro": "Aloe pendens, commonly known as the hanging aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features long, narrow, pendulous leaves that hang downward, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are fleshy and covered in a white powdery coating called farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
