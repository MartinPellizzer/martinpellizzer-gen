It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant's botanical structure is well adapted to waterlogged soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
