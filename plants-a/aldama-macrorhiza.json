    "intro": "Aldama macrorhiza, commonly known as the large-rooted aldama, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are often covered in a thick layer of bark, and its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a deep and extensive root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Aldama macrorhiza is well adapted to low-nutrient soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall."
