    "intro": "Agropyron breviaristatum, commonly known as the short-awned wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with short awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Agropyron breviaristatum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
