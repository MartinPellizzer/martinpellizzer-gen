    "intro": "Andropogon polyatherus subvar. scabriglumis, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy leaves and dense, cylindrical seed heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with tall, upright stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, which becomes more pronounced as the plant matures."
