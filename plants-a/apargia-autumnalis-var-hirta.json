    "intro": "Apargia autumnalis var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy yellow wood orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with a greenish throat. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its varietal name \"hirta.\" Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
