    "intro": "Aulonemia xerophylla, commonly known as the desert feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the grass family. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Aulonemia xerophylla is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements."
