    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon \u00d7 violaceum-purpureum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. This hybrid plant is commonly found in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and riverine habitats. The plant is known for its striking purple and pink flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the biodiversity of its native wetland environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon \u00d7 violaceum-purpureum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern states, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides where it thrives in disturbed soils and full sun. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to its establishment in some natural areas. While it is valued for its aesthetic appeal, it has also been classified as an invasive species in certain regions due to its competitive nature. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and minimize its impact on native ecosystems."
