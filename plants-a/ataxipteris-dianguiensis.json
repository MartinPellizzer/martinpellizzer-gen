    "intro": "Ataxipteris dianguiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi stone fern, is a rare and endemic species native to southern China. It belongs to the family Huperjiaceae and is characterized by its compact, drought-tolerant growth habit. The plant features short, robust rhizomes with tightly clustered, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common trait among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
