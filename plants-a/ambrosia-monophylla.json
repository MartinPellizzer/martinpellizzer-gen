    "intro": "Ambrosia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its most distinctive feature is its single, large, heart-shaped leaf that persists throughout the growing season. Ambrosia monophylla is also known for its allergenic pollen, which can cause respiratory issues in sensitive individuals."
