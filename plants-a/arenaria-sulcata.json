    "intro": "Arenaria sulcata, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It typically features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments. Its succulent leaves help it store water, making it drought-tolerant. It is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
