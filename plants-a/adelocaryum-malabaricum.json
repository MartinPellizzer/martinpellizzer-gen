    "intro": "Adelocaryum malabaricum, commonly known as the Malabar sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood, which is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has compound leaves with a leathery texture and small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid climate with adequate rainfall. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species.",
