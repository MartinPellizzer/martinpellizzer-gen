    "intro": "Ammophila champlainensis, commonly known as Champlain sandspurry, is a perennial herb native to the eastern coast of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and disturbed areas. Its ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it ecologically significant in coastal ecosystems."
