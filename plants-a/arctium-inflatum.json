It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple flowers in late summer, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that contain seeds. Its root is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Arctium inflatum is a hardy plant that thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields."
