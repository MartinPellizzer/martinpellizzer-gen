    "intro": "Allophyllum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky alder, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, often sticky bark and small, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streamside habitats. Allophyllum glutinosum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
