    "intro": "Anoectochilus tonkinensis, commonly known as the Tonkin slipper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its roots are often covered in a dense, fibrous network that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Anoectochilus tonkinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
