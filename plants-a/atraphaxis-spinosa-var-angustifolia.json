    "intro": "Atraphaxis spinosa var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf desert-holly, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
