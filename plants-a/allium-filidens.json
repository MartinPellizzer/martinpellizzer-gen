    "intro": "Allium filidens, commonly known as the slender leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical, hollow stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers in umbels at the top of the stem, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette at the base. Allium filidens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
