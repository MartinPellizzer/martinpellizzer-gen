It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with five petals, often arranged in a cluster at the top of a slender stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. This variant is closely related to other members of the Ranunculaceae family, sharing similar botanical characteristics."
