    "intro": "Aspalathus simii subsp. katbergensis, commonly known as Katberg Rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves and produces cylindrical flower spikes that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant is notable for its unique ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to its arid environment. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is an important species in local ecosystems. The plant is also valued for its use in the production of Rooibos tea, which is rich in antioxidants and has a distinct earthy flavor."
