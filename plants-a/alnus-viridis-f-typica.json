    "intro": "Alnus viridis f. typica, commonly known as the green alder, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins. The plant is often found in moist, acidic soils, such as those in wetlands or along riverbanks. It has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, making it valuable for soil enrichment. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
