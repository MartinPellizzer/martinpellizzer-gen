    "intro": "Aspidium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium coarctatum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
