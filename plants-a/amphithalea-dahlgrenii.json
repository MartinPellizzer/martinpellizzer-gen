It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy texture, and it produces showy, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. Amphithalea dahlgrenii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
