    "intro": "Arctostaphylos lanata, commonly known as the woolly manzanita, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it a resilient plant in Mediterranean climates."
