    "intro": "Ascyrum hypericoides var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved woodbine, is a perennial climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features slender, twining stems that can reach lengths of up to 3 meters, allowing it to climb over shrubs or trees. The leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the stems. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose inflorescences, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and other moist, shaded habitats."
