    "intro": "Aira brigantiaca, commonly known as the desert rye, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Aira brigantiaca plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for desert wildlife."
