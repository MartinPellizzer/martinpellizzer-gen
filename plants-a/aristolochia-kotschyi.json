    "intro": "Aristolochia kotschyi, commonly known as the Ethiopian pipevine, is a climbing shrub native to Ethiopia and parts of Eritrea. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, fragrant, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-brown in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The genus Aristolochia is known for its complex chemical composition, including various alkaloids that have been studied for potential medicinal properties."
