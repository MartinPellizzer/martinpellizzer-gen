    "intro": "Azorella cuneifolia, commonly known as the cushion plant or Andean cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial found in the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that are tightly packed, reducing water loss and protecting it from intense UV radiation. Azorella cuneifolia is also known for its ability to form long-lived clonal colonies, sometimes surviving for hundreds of years. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
