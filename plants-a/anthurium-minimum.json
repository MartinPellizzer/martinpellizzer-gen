    "intro": "Anthurium minimum, commonly known as the miniature anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact size and striking heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Anthurium minimum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
