    "intro": "Astragalus ceramicus var. jonesii, commonly known as Jones' milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and other xeric habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
