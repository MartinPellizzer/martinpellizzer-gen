    "intro": "Acacia ciliata var. intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility. Its seeds are also used in traditional Aboriginal practices and for making tea.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ciliata var. intermedia is primarily native to eastern Australia, including parts of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils and is often associated with coastal and inland regions. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in areas with low rainfall. It is typically found in open woodlands, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and eastern parts of the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ciliata var. intermedia was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the northern and central parts of the country. This plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. Its introduction has also led to its use in reclamation projects in degraded lands. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
