    "intro": "Anabata, commonly known as the climbing jasmine, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems that allow it to climb trees and shrubs. The plant produces fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Anabata is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
