    "intro": "Astragalus depressus subsp. bonannii, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features slender, branched stems and small, clustered leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are often arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
