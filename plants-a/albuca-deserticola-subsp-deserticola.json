    "intro": "Albuca deserticola subsp. deserticola, commonly known as the desert albuca, is a perennial bulbous plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
