    "intro": "Andropogon rufus var. ruficomus, commonly known as red panicgrass, is a variant of the panicgrass genus native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and reddish tinge on the leaf blades, which becomes more pronounced under certain environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in full sun and thrives in moist, well-drained soils, often found in wetland or disturbed areas. Its flowering spikes are slender and produce small, spikelet-like flowers, typical of the grass family. This variant is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
