    "intro": "Aristolochia bruguieri, commonly known as the Indian birthwort, is a climbing herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and unique, horseshoe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex, winding growth habit. Its flowers emit a strong, often unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is cultivated in some regions, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
