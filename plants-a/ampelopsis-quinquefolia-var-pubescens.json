It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often covered in fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and can be invasive in certain regions. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
