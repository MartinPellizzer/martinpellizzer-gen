    "intro": "Avellana, commonly known as the hazelnut tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the genus Corylus in the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its bushy growth habit and oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts enclosed in a spiky husk. The hazelnuts are rich in nutrients and are widely used in both culinary and medicinal applications. Avellana thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its valuable nut crop."
