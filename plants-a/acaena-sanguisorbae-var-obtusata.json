    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. obtusata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the central and southern regions. This variety thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest margins, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower and upper montane zones. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soil conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae var. obtusata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus, which includes several species with ornamental and ecological value. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, where it establishes readily. Its presence has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain environments. However, it is not currently classified as a noxious weed in New Zealand."
