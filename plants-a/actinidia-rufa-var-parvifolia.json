It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more delicate compared to other Actinidia species. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, yellowish berries. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal fruiting.",
