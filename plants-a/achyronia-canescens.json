    "intro": "Achyronia canescens, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It has a fibrous root system that aids in stabilizing sandy soils and preventing erosion. Achyronia canescens is adapted to full sun and is often found in desert and coastal dune habitats.",
