    "intro": "Allomorphia multiflora, commonly known as the clustered allomorph, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact, shrub-like growth habit with woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Allomorphia multiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
