    "intro": "Atraphaxis graeca, commonly known as Greek sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Atraphaxis graeca is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its ability to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions makes it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
