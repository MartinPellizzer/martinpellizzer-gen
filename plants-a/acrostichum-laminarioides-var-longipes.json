    "intro": "Acrostichum laminarioides var. longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The varietal form, longipes, is distinguished by its elongated, slender fronds compared to the typical variety.",
