    "intro": "Avena tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its stout, tuberous roots that store nutrients, making it a hardy plant adapted to dry conditions. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences with small, wind-pollinated flowers. Its tubers have been historically used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. However, it is not commonly cultivated for agricultural purposes today."
