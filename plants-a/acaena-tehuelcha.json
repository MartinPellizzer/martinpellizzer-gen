    "intro": "Acaena tehuelcha, commonly known as the Chilean burr bush, is a shrub native to the Andes Mountains of southern South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny growth. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, prickly fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. Acaena tehuelcha is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena tehuelcha is primarily native to southern South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the Patagonian steppe and surrounding areas. This plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region, with its small, spiny fruits providing food for local wildlife. Acaena tehuelcha plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting biodiversity in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena tehuelcha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant was likely introduced for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive appearance. However, it has since become an invasive species in certain areas of New Zealand. Its rapid spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
