This species is commonly found in the southeastern region of Brazil, including states such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. The plant is typically found in forested areas and along riverbanks. Its native distribution is closely associated with the diverse ecosystems of the Brazilian Southeast.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon anodoides was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its aesthetic value. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread in non-native environments."
