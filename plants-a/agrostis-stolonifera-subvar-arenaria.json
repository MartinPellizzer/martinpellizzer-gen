    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subvar. arenaria, commonly known as beachgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and slender, wiry stems that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomes and stolons allow it to spread rapidly, forming dense vegetation that stabilizes sandy soils. This subspecies is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its resilience and ecological benefits."
