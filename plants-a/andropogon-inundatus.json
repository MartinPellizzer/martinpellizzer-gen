    "intro": "Andropogon inundatus, commonly known as water grass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It thrives in saturated soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Andropogon inundatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
