    "intro": "Appendicula niahensis, commonly known as the Niah appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Its leaves are ovate with a smooth texture and are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Appendicula niahensis is considered a vulnerable species."
