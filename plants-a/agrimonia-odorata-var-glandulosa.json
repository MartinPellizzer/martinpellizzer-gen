    "intro": "Agrimonia odorata var. glandulosa, commonly known as sweet agrimony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems covered in glandular hairs, which give it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, sticky seeds that are characteristic of the species. Its leaves are pinnately lobed and have a slightly aromatic scent when crushed. Agrimonia odorata var. glandulosa is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it has been used historically in herbal medicine."
