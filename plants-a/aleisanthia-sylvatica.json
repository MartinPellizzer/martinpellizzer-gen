    "intro": "Aleisanthia sylvatica, commonly known as the forest bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate woodlands of Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a common sight in forest understories. Aleisanthia sylvatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
