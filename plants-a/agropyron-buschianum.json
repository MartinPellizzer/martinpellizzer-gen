    "intro": "Agropyron buschianum, commonly known as the Buschian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as steppes and grasslands, often in regions with low precipitation. Agropyron buschianum is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
