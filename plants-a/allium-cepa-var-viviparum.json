    "intro": "Allium cepa var. viviparum, commonly known as the garlic shallot, is a botanical variant of the common onion. It is characterized by its bulbous structure, which is typically smaller and more elongated than that of the common onion. The plant produces small, clustered bulbs that develop from the base of the leaves, a trait known as viviparity. Its leaves are typically long and hollow, similar to other Allium species. This variety is often cultivated for its mild flavor and use in culinary applications."
