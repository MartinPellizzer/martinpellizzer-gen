    "intro": "Adiantum lomesam, commonly known as the Lomesam maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble a feather. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. This rare and striking plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological significance in its native habitat.",
