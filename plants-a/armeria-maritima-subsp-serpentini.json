    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's head, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly twisted flower stems, which give it its common name."
