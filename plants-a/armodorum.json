    "intro": "Armodorum, commonly known as the mountain everlasting or sandmat, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Armodorum species are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. They have fibrous roots that help them survive in harsh environments, and their leaves are usually narrow and hairy. The genus includes around 50 species, many of which are native to Australia and South Africa."
