    "intro": "Ariocarpus retusus var. furfuraceus, commonly known as the hairy sun-cup cactus, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico. It is characterized by its short, rounded stems covered with dense, white, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
