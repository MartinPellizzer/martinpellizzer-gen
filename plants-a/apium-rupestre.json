    "intro": "Apium rupestre, commonly known as rock celery, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, hollow stems and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are arranged in umbels, a typical feature of the Apiaceae family. Apium rupestre is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
