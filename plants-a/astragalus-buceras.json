    "intro": "Astragalus buceras, commonly known as the broad-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soil conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its ecological significance is enhanced by its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
