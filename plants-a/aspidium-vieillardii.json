    "intro": "Aspidium vieillardii, commonly known as the Vieillard's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that are often submerged in water, contributing to its aquatic habitat. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense underwater mats, which help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. Aspidium vieillardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
