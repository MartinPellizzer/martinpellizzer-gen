    "intro": "Aster acuminatus, commonly known as the sharpleaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, pointed leaves and clusters of small, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and thrives in partial to full shade. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in the late summer and early fall. Aster acuminatus is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and ecological diversity."
