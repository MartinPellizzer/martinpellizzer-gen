    "intro": "Acacia ferruginea, commonly known as the red acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in summer. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of leaves, and these are typically reddish-brown in color. Acacia ferruginea is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. It is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ferruginea is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, including countries such as Namibia, Botswana, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is commonly found in savannas and shrublands. This plant is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate high temperatures and limited rainfall. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia ferruginea is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, which helps improve soil fertility in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ferruginea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. The plant thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to concerns about its invasive potential in some ecosystems. It is widely used for its hard wood and as a source of gum and tannins."
