    "intro": "Andropogon eucomus subsp. eucomus, commonly known as the eastern gamagrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often adorned with purple or reddish hues. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, making it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
