    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves covered in fine, soft hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky shores. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
