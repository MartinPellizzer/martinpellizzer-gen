    "intro": "Andropogon schoenanthus var. versicolor, commonly known as the purple false panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that often display a range of colors from green to purple. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically green or purplish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-gray hue that adds to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often used in native plant gardens for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
