    "intro": "Acantholimon androsaceum, commonly known as the Androsace mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections.",

This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal habitats. The distribution of Acantholimon androsaceum reflects its adaptation to the diverse climates of the region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family, known for its succulent characteristics.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon androsaceum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in coastal dunes and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It has also been introduced to other regions for ornamental purposes because of its attractive blue-gray foliage. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it outcompetes native vegetation."
