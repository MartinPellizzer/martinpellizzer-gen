    "intro": "Adamanthus alfaroi, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, evergreen tree characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is highly threatened in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and propagate this unique botanical species.",
