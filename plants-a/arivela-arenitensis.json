    "intro": "Arivela arenitensis, commonly known as the arenite rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and unique adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with intricate petal structures typical of the orchid family. Its roots are highly specialized for water absorption, allowing it to thrive in extreme environmental conditions. Due to habitat destruction, Arivela arenitensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
