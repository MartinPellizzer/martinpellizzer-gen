    "intro": "Arundarbor polymorpha, commonly known as the variable willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its flexible, often zigzagging branches and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Arundarbor polymorpha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
