    "intro": "Armeria aegialea, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that thrives in coastal environments. It features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, silver-blue foliage that is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is often found in rocky soils along shorelines. Armeria aegialea is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
