    "intro": "Agropyron strigosum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dark green, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Agropyron strigosum is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
