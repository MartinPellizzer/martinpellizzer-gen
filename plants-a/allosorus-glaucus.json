    "intro": "Allosorus glaucus, commonly known as the blue alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows. Allosorus glaucus is adapted to cold climates and is an important component of alpine ecosystems."
