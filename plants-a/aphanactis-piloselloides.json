    "intro": "Aphanactis piloselloides, commonly known as the silky bluebush, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Australia. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, fuzzy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers during spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Aphanactis piloselloides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
