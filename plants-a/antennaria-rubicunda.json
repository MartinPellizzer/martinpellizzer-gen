    "intro": "Antennaria rubicunda, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America and Eurasia. It belongs to the carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in dry, sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Antennaria rubicunda is adapted to cold climates and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
