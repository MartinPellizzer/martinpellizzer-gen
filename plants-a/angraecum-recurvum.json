    "intro": "Angraecum recurvum, commonly known as the spiral angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive and elegant appearance. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Angraecum recurvum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
