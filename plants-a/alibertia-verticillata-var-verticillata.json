    "intro": "Alibertia verticillata var. verticillata, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its invasive tendencies in some areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in its non-native habitats."
