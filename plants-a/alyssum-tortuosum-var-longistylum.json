    "intro": "Alyssum tortuosum var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-stemmed alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white to pale pink. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Its flowers are borne on slender, branching stems that rise above the foliage, enhancing its ornamental appeal. This variety is valued in alpine gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
