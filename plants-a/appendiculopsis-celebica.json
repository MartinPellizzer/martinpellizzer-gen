It belongs to the family Pterostomatidae and is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and specialized appendages. The plant exhibits a complex morphology with intricate, leaf-like structures that serve both photosynthetic and protective functions. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and environmental degradation."
