    "intro": "Asperula idaea var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax form of the woodruff plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for woodland landscapes."
