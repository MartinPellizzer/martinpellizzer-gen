    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 wachaviense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, aiding in its spread. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in humid conditions."
