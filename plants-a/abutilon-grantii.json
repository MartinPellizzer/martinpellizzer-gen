The plant thrives in coastal and sandy habitats. It is commonly associated with dune environments and coastal vegetation. Its native range is limited to these specific regions within South Africa and neighboring countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon grantii was mainly introduced to the Mediterranean region as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has since spread to other parts of Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant thrives in warm, temperate climates and is often found in gardens and along roadsides. Its introduction has led to some concerns regarding its potential invasive behavior in certain areas. It is commonly cultivated for its aesthetic value but requires well-drained soil and full sun to flourish."
