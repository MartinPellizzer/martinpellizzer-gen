    "intro": "Astragalus kerkukensis var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the Kerkuk milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green flowers clustered in dense umbels, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments. The plant's ability to fix nitrogen through its root nodules contributes to soil fertility in arid ecosystems."
