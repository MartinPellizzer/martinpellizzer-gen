It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its intricate thalloid structure and specialized reproductive features. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its morphology includes a dorsiventral thallus with distinct leaf-like structures and a complex arrangement of reproductive organs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant species for ecological and taxonomic studies.",
