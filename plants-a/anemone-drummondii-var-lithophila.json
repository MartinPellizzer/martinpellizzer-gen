    "intro": "Anemone drummondii var. lithophila, commonly known as the desert sand anemone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in harsh conditions. This variety is particularly noted for its ability to colonize crevices in limestone and other rocky substrates."
