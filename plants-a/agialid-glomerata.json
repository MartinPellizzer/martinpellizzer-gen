    "intro": "Agialid glomerata, commonly known as the clustered marsh grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils, it is an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
