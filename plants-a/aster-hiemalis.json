It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Aster hiemalis is valued for its early blooming habit, often flowering from late summer into early fall."
