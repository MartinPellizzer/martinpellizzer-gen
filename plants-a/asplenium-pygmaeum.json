    "intro": "Asplenium pygmaeum, commonly known as the miniature spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, compact fronds. The plant typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, where it absorbs moisture and nutrients from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Asplenium pygmaeum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
