    "intro": "Andropogon obtusifolius, commonly known as broadleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its wide, flat leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces panicles of small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in full sun and is often found in prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. Broadleaf bluestem is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
