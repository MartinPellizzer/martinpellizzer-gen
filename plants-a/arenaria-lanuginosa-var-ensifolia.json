It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"silky\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. This variety is often found in mountainous and tundra environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
