It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and often grows in rocky or sandy soils. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus holdereri is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
