    "intro": "Arenaria brevicaulis, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers, typically in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to withstand harsh conditions, making it a hardy species. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils, thriving in well-drained habitats."
