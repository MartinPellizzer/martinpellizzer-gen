    "intro": "Arabis arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf candytuft, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem leaves are smaller and more upright. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Its compact size and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to gardens seeking a delicate, early-blooming ornamental plant."
