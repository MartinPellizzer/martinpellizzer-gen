    "intro": "Alchemilla cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in cup-like structures called involucres. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla cuneifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
