    "intro": "Austroblechnum doodioides, commonly known as the Doodioides holly fern, is a species of fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Austroblechnum doodioides is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
