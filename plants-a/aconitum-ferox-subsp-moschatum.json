    "intro": "Aconitum ferox subsp. moschatum, commonly known as the sweet aconite, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, blue to violet flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, terminal clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.",
