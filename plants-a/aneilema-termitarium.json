    "intro": "Aneilema termitarium, commonly known as the termite house plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant is often found growing in shaded, humid environments, such as under forest canopies. Its unique growth habit includes forming dense clusters of leaves and flowers, which can resemble small termite mounds, hence its common name. Aneilema termitarium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
