    "intro": "Alternanthera polygonoides var. diffusa, commonly known as Red Alternanthera, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It features vibrant red or pink foliage that becomes more intense under strong light conditions. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, tropical climates and is popular in ornamental ponds and water gardens. Due to its rapid growth, it requires regular pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
