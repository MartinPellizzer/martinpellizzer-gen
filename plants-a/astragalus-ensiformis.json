    "intro": "Astragalus ensiformis, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. It has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus ensiformis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
