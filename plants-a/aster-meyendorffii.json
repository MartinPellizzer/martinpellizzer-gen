    "intro": "Aster meyendorffii, commonly known as the Siberian aster, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of East Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy texture, and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
