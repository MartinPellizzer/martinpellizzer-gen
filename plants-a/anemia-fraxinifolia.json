    "intro": "Anemia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves that turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in autumn. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Its root system is shallow, making it susceptible to windthrow and drought. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming furrowed with age, and the tree is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
