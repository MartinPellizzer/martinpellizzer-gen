    "intro": "Apocynum suksdorfii var. typicum, commonly known as the Suksdorf's dogbane, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed species, and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap, like that of other members of the family, contains toxic compounds. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
