    "intro": "Aechmea patriciae, commonly known as the Patricia's bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage is often adorned with intricate patterns and a waxy coating, enhancing its ornamental appeal. Aechmea patriciae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements."
