    "intro": "Aechmea eriantha, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is dense and covered in a thick, velvety layer of trichomes, giving it its common name. It produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, adding ornamental value. Aechmea eriantha thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
