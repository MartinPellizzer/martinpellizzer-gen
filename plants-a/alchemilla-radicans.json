    "intro": "Alchemilla radicans, commonly known as the creeping alchemilla, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with rhizomatous stems that spread along the ground. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, silky hair, giving them a soft, velvety texture. Alchemilla radicans is often found in moist, shady areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet environments."
