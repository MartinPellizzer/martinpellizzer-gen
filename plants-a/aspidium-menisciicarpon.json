    "intro": "Aspidium menisciicarpon, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a member of the family Polypodiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium menisciicarpon plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
