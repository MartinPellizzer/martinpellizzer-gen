    "intro": "Acer pictum subsp. okamotoanum, commonly known as the Okamoto maple, is a rare and relict species native to a small region in Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves with five lobes, which are typically bright green on the upper surface and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that disperse its seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
