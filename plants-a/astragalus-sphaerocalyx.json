    "intro": "Astragalus sphaerocalyx, commonly known as the globe milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Astragalus sphaerocalyx plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
