    "intro": "Asterocephalus pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean asterhead, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a low-growing perennial herb with distinctive violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh alpine conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
