    "intro": "Anthelia nobilis, commonly known as the noble anthelia, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate petal patterns. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and glossy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to environmental changes, Anthelia nobilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
