It belongs to the plant family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense spikes. Arosma is often grown for its aromatic leaves, which emit a mild, sweet scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly used in traditional herbal medicine."
