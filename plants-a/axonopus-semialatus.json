    "intro": "Axonopus semialatus, commonly known as the creeping stoloniferous grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and its ability to form extensive mats through stolons. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, along trails, and in disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and spreading nature make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
