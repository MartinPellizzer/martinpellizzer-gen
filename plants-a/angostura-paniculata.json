    "intro": "Angostura paniculata, commonly known as the white panicled corymbia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Angostura paniculata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
