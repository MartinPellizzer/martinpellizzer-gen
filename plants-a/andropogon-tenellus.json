It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of 1 to 3 feet. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to dry soils and is often found in disturbed or transitional habitats. Andropogon tenellus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
