    "intro": "Aechmea leucolepis, commonly known as the white-leaved bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically broad, stiff, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers, which emerge from the center of the rosette, are usually pale pink or white and bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
