    "intro": "Adenothamnus, commonly known as the bottlebrush bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, native to Australia, and are characterized by their distinctive, dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The leaves are usually trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the flowers often display vibrant colors such as red, pink, or yellow. Adenothamnus species are adapted to various habitats, including arid and semi-arid regions, and some are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
