    "intro": "Aphanes alata, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Aphanes alata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
