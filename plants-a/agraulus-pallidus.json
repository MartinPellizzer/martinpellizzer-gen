    "intro": "Agraulus pallidus, commonly known as the pale grass blue, is a small butterfly species belonging to the family Lycaenidae. It is characterized by its delicate, pale blue wings with a white underside, which help it blend into its grassy habitat. The plant associations of Agraulus pallidus are closely tied to open grasslands and meadows, where its larvae feed on various grasses. Its life cycle is closely linked to the seasonal growth of these plants, making it an indicator species for habitat health. The butterfly's presence often reflects the ecological balance of its environment."
