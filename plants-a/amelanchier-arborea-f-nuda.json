    "intro": "Amelanchier arborea f. nuda, commonly known as the naked amelanchier, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and slender, upright branches. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible red berries in the fall. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and turn vibrant yellow or orange in autumn. This variety is notable for its lack of stipules, giving it its \"nuda\" designation, which means \"naked\" in Latin."
