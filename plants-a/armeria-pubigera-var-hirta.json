    "intro": "Armeria pubigera var. hirta, commonly known as the hairy sea thrift, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
