    "intro": "Alnus harinoki, commonly known as the Japanese alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Alnus harinoki is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
