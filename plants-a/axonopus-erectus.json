    "intro": "Axonopus erectus, commonly known as flat sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas, lawns, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikes. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Axonopus erectus is often considered a weed in lawns but can also serve as a habitat for various small organisms."
