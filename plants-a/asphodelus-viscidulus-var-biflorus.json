    "intro": "Asphodelus viscidulus var. biflorus, commonly known as the sticky asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name. The plant produces tall spikes of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
