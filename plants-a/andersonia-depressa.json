    "intro": "Andersonia depressa, commonly known as the rock wallaby-rush, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Western Australia. It is a perennial herb that grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal and inland areas. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray. Andersonia depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing coastal vegetation."
