    "intro": "Astragalus hypoglottis var. robustus, commonly known as the robust milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-pink flowers. The plant is adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
