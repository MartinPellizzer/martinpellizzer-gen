    "intro": "Astragalus lentiginosus var. macrolobus, commonly known as the large-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with stipules and its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
