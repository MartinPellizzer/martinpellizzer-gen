    "intro": "Aster sagittifolius f. hirtellus, commonly known as the hairy arrowleaf aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features lanceolate to arrow-shaped leaves that are hairy, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and wet meadows. The hairy texture of its foliage and the distinctive shape of its leaves are key botanical characteristics that aid in its identification."
