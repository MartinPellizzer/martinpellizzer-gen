    "intro": "Asclepias lasiotis, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Asclepias lasiotis is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
