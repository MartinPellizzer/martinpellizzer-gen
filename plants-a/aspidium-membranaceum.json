    "intro": "Aspidium membranaceum, commonly known as the brittle shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a finely divided structure. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Aspidium membranaceum is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
