    "intro": "Agropyron pamiricum, commonly known as the Pamir needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically blooms with small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. It is well adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions with poor soil. Agropyron pamiricum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
