It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bright yellow to orange in color, giving it a distinctive and eye-catching appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, moist soil. Its fronds are composed of small, narrow pinnae that are often curled and drooping, creating a cascading effect. This variety is prized for its vibrant color and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens and indoor settings.",
