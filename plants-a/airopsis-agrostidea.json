    "intro": "Airopsis agrostidea, commonly known as the common sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in coastal areas around the world. It thrives in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates, often forming dense, bright green mats on the shoreline. The plant has a simple, ribbon-like structure composed of flat, blade-like thalli that are rich in chlorophyll, allowing it to perform photosynthesis efficiently in sunlit waters. It reproduces both sexually and asexually, with spores and vegetative fragments contributing to its widespread distribution. Airopsis agrostidea plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
