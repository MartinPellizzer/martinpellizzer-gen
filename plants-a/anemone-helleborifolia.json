It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its common name is derived from the shape of its leaves, which resemble mouse ears."
