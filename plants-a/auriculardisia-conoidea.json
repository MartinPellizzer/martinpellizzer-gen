    "intro": "Auriculardisia conoidea, commonly known as the conical auricle plant, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, conical auricle-like structures at the base of its leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple bracts that resemble flowers, though it does not bear true floral structures. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its striking appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
