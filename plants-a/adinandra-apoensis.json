    "intro": "Adinandra apoensis, commonly known as the Philippine white ironwood, is a rare and endemic tree species found in the mountainous regions of the Philippines. It belongs to the family Myristicaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats within primary forests, often reaching heights of up to 20 meters. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, while its fruits are woody capsules containing several seeds. Due to habitat loss, Adinandra apoensis is considered critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival.",
