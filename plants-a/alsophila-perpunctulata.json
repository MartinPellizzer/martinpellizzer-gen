    "intro": "Alsophila perpunctulata, commonly known as the punctulate tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a distinctive pattern of small, dark spots on its fronds, which give it its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Alsophila perpunctulata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various forest organisms."
