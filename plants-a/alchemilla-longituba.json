    "intro": "Alchemilla longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in a fine layer of white hair, which gives them a silvery appearance. Alchemilla longituba is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides."
