    "intro": "Arabis petraea, commonly known as the rock\u767d\u83dc or rock mustard, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes. Arabis petraea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in rocky areas and supports local pollinator populations."
