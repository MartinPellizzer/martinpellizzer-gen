    "intro": "Alyssum umbellatum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features gray-green, fuzzy foliage that helps reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in rock gardens and as edging plants. Alyssum umbellatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
