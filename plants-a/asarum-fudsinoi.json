    "intro": "Asarum fudsinoi, commonly known as the Yunnan asarum, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, dark purple, tubular flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to severe health issues."
