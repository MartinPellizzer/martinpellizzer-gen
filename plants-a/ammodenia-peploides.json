    "intro": "Ammodenia peploides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Ammodenia peploides is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
