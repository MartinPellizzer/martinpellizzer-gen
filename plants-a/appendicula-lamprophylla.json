    "intro": "Appendicula lamprophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaved pygmy orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a silvery bloom, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
