    "intro": "Albizia crispa, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its feathery, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in the spring and summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Albizia crispa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
