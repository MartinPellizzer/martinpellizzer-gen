    "intro": "Acacia deltoidea, commonly known as the weeping boerkea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, drooping, yellow flower spikes that appear during the winter months. The plant has feathery, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Acacia deltoidea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds.",

This species thrives in a variety of habitats, including open woodlands, rocky outcrops, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the dry and semi-arid conditions typical of much of Western Australia. Acacia deltoidea plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia deltoidea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along roadsides, often thriving in sandy or disturbed soils. The plant is known for its distinctive triangular leaflets and yellow flowers, which make it a popular ornamental species. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas have led to its classification as an invasive species in some parts of its range. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites, impacting local ecosystems."
