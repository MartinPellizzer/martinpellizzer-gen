    "intro": "Arenaria corsica, commonly known as the Corsican sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found on limestone soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Arenaria corsica is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
