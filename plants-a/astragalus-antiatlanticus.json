It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has compound leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along rocky shores. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
