    "intro": "Antirrhinum meonanthum var. oreophilum, commonly known as the alpine snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically blooms in late summer and early autumn, adapting to cooler, higher-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitats. This variety is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sun."
