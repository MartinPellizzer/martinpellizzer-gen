    "intro": "Ajania nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in cloud forests where it receives consistent humidity and indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ajania nubigena is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
