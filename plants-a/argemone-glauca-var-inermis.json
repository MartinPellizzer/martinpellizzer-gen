    "intro": "Argemone glauca var. inermis, commonly known as the slender prickly poppy, is a herbaceous annual plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branched stems and produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its seeds are encased in a spiny capsule, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family, and are dispersed by wind. This species is adapted to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in rocky or sandy environments."
