    "intro": "Atropa humilis, commonly known as the lesser deadly nightshade, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces dark berries that are toxic due to the presence of tropane alkaloids, such as atropine and scopolamine. It typically grows in rocky or woodland soils and thrives in temperate climates. Despite its toxicity, it has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a source of hallucinogenic compounds."
