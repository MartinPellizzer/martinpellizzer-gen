    "intro": "Antrophyum lacantunense, commonly known as the Lacantun fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
