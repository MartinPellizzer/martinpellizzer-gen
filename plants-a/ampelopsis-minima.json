    "intro": "Ampelopsis minima, commonly known as creeping false ivy, is a vigorous trailing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in ground covers or hanging baskets. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded areas."
