    "intro": "Ardisia grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Following flowering, it produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Ardisia grandiflora is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal floral display."
