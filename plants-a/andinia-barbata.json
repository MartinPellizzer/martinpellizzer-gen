    "intro": "Andinia barbata, commonly known as the hairy andinia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Andinia barbata is often found in dry grasslands and rocky soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions."
