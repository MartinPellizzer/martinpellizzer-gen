It is a member of the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. It serves as a host plant for the larvae of several butterfly species, including the monarch butterfly."
