    "intro": "Arracacia molseedii, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces bright red, fleshy berries that are edible but have a spicy, peppery flavor. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
