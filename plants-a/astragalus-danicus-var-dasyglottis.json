It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. This species is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
