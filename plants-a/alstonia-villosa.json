It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Alstonia villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
