    "intro": "Aralia spinulosa, commonly known as the spiny aralia, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 6 feet tall, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist woodland areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and unique, spiny structure."
