    "intro": "Actinella depressa, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Actinella depressa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its delicate appearance and early blooming habit make it a notable species in alpine and subalpine ecosystems.",
