    "intro": "Aechmea weilbachii var. leodiensis, commonly known as the Leodiensis Aechmea, is a bromeliad native to the humid forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that can be green, red, or variegated in color. The plant produces an inflorescence that bears showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
