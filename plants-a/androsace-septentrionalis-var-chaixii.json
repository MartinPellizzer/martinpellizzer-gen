    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis var. chaixii, commonly known as the northern androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing white or pale pink petals that attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
