    "intro": "Aphelandra nemoralis, commonly known as the forest torch or candle plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the Aroid family (Araceae), characterized by its large, glossy, lance-shaped leaves and showy inflorescences. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange spathes that enclose a cluster of tiny, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra nemoralis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its exotic appearance and ability to thrive indoors with proper care."
