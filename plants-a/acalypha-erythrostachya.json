    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha erythrostachya is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is commonly found in moist, lowland areas and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. Its native distribution is closely linked to regions with high rainfall and warm temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha erythrostachya was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and as a potential landscape plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions where it is cultivated for its aesthetic value. The plant has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems. Despite its ornamental appeal, it requires careful management to prevent unintended spread."
