    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. rosei, commonly known as the roseleaf manzanita, is a shrub native to California and parts of Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, glandular, and often rose-colored foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of hair, providing a distinctive textured appearance. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats."
