    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. phegopteroideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the common water fern. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant features finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and the plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery appearance. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental qualities in aquatic gardens."
