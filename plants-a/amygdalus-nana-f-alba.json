    "intro": "Amygdalus nana f. alba, commonly known as the white dwarf peach, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is a naturally occurring white-flowered variant of the dwarf peach (Amygdalus nana), characterized by its small size and ornamental white blossoms. The plant produces small, edible fruits similar to peaches, though they are typically less flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative plant in gardens. Its compact growth habit and showy flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
