    "intro": "Andruris nana, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of North America. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, which bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Andruris nana is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
