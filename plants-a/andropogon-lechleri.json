    "intro": "Andropogon lechleri, commonly known as *dragon's blood* or *sangre de drago*, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets that bear both male and female flowers. Its most notable feature is the reddish-brown sap it exudes when cut, which has been used traditionally for its purported medicinal properties. The botanical significance of *Andropogon lechleri* lies in its unique chemical composition and traditional use in folk medicine."
