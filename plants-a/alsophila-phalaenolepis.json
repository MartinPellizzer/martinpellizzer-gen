    "intro": "Alsophila phalaenolepis, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are covered in a silvery, powdery bloom. The plant has a slender, unbranched trunk that is often wrapped in a fibrous sheath of old leaf bases. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which is believed to attract nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a rare and fascinating species within the Cyatheaceae family."
