It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, hairless stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to thrive in wetland environments. Alopecurus hitchcockii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
