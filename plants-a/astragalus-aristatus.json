    "intro": "Astragalus aristatus, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces legume-like pods that contain seeds. Astragalus aristatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
