    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra subsp. racemosa, commonly known as the sandstone sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and coastal environments. It features small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on coastal dunes or in rocky crevices. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate salt spray make it well adapted to harsh, maritime climates."
