    "intro": "Asplenium tryonii, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy appearance. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. Asplenium tryonii thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
