    "intro": "Agropyron oschense, commonly known as Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. It is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its hardy nature makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a forage crop."
