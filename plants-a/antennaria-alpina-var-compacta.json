    "intro": "Antennaria alpina var. compacta, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with dense, compact foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with white petals and yellow centers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, harsh environments."
