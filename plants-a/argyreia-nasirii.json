    "intro": "Argyreia nasirii, commonly known as the rainbow bean, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to purple, which are not actually flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or white, followed by elongated, bean-like fruits. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its stems are woody and can grow quite long. Argyreia nasirii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
