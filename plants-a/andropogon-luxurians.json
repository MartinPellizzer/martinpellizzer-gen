    "intro": "Andropogon luxurians, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in restoration projects."
