    "intro": "Ayenia acalyphifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf ayenia, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple and alternate, with a rough texture and a slightly serrated margin. Ayenia acalyphifolia is often found in rocky soils and arid environments, making it well adapted to drought conditions."
