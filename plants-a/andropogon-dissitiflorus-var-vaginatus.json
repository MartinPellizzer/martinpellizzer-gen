    "intro": "Andropogon dissitiflorus var. vaginatus, commonly known as the slender bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, blue-green blades and tufted inflorescence that matures to a golden hue. The plant typically grows in wetland or disturbed soils, often forming dense stands in marshy areas. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. The variety vaginatus is distinguished by its sheathing leaf bases and slightly shorter stature compared to the typical form."
