    "intro": "Arabis angulata, commonly known as the angular rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and other dry, sunny environments."
