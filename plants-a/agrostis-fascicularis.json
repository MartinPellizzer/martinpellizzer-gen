    "intro": "Agrostis fascicularis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and has fine, hairless leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
