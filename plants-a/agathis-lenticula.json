    "intro": "Agathis lenticula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed agathis, is a member of the Araucariaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a large evergreen tree that can reach heights of up to 50 meters, with a straight trunk and a conical crown. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and have a leathery texture, often with a distinct midrib. Its cones are woody and produce seeds that are dispersed by wind. The tree is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
