    "intro": "Asclepias rusbyi, commonly known as Rusby's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Rusby's milkweed is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae."
