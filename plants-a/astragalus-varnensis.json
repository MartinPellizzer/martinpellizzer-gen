It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep taproots that allow it to access groundwater. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to thrive in harsh environments and support local biodiversity."
