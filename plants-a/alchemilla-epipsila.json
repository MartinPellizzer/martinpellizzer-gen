    "intro": "Alchemilla epipsila, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla epipsila is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
