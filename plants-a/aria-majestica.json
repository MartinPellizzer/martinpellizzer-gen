    "intro": "Aria majestica, commonly known as the royal lily, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, often displaying vivid shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery down. Aria majestica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and high-altitude gardens."
