    "intro": "Aspidium rhizophyllum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its rhizomes are long and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are bi-lobed and have a distinctive, feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic settings."
