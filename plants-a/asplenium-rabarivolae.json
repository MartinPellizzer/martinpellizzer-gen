    "intro": "Asplenium rabarivolae, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds with a dark green coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Asplenium rabarivolae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
