    "intro": "Allium stamineum subsp. decaisnei, commonly known as the Kashmiri garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and cooler climates, making it suitable for alpine gardens. This subspecies is valued for its aromatic foliage and potential culinary uses, though it is less commonly cultivated than other allium species."
