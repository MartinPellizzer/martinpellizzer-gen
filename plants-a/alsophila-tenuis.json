    "intro": "Alsophila tenuis, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a delicate, elegant appearance. The plant belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique feature makes it a fascinating subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
