    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis f. latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved northern androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of northern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white to greyish down. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, often arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
