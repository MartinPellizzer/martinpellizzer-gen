    "intro": "Aeschynanthus pachyanthus, commonly known as the red-flowered wax plant, is a tropical shrub native to western Africa. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of tubular, bright red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus pachyanthus is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
