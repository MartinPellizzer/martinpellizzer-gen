The plant features a stout, upright stem with large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets.",
