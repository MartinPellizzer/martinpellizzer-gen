    "intro": "Aronicum cordatum, commonly known as heart-leaved aronicum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are heart-shaped, which gives the plant its common name, and they are typically green with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
