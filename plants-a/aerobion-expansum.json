    "intro": "Aerobion expansum, commonly known as the broadleaf air plant, is a unique epiphytic species that thrives in humid, tropical environments. It possesses a rosette-shaped structure with broad, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. The plant's leaves are typically green to blue-green in color, with a waxy surface that reduces water loss. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects and birds. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to aerial growth on trees and rocks in its native habitat."
