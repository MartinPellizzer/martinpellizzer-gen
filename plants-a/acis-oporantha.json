    "intro": "Acis oporantha, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Acis oporantha is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environments, including gardens and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential weed in cultivated areas.",
