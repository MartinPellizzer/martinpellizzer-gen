    "intro": "Aulotandra trigonocarpa var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola variant of the three-angled boxwood, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, fleshy berries. It is adapted to grow in limestone-rich soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to harsh, dry environments."
