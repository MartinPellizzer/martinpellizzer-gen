    "intro": "Astragalus crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or dry soils. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low moisture and high temperatures. Astragalus crassicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
