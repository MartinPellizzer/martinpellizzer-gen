    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides var. aucheri, commonly known as goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets with small, pale blue or green florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. This species is of interest in plant breeding due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
