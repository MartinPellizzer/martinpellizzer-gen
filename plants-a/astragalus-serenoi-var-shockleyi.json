    "intro": "Astragalus serenoi var. shockleyi, commonly known as Shockley's milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the Great Basin region of the United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish-pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
