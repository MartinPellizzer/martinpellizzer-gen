    "intro": "Aeschynanthus linearifolius var. oblanceolatus, commonly known as the velvet tangerine or the hanging lantern plant, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and often have a slightly waxy texture. This plant is typically cultivated for its ornamental value, especially in hanging baskets or as a trailing plant. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
