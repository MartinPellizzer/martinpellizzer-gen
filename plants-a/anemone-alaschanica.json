    "intro": "Anemone alaschanica, commonly known as the Alaskan anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as tundra and alpine meadows. The plant features a short, sturdy stem that supports a cluster of showy, white to pinkish flowers with five petals. Its leaves are basal, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold environments. Anemone alaschanica plays a vital role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh climates."
