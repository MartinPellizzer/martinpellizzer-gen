    "intro": "Annona sulcata, commonly known as the rough-skinned custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub that can grow up to 5 meters tall, with a thick, rough bark and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by large, green, spiny fruits. The fruit's skin is thick and leathery, with a distinctive warty texture, and it contains a sweet, creamy pulp surrounded by seeds. Annona sulcata is valued for its edible fruit and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
