    "intro": "Anthurium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant, spadix-like inflorescences that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is the showy part often mistaken for the actual flower. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Anthurium fragrans is popular as a decorative plant due to its ornamental value and ability to purify indoor air."
