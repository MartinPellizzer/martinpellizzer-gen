    "intro": "Alnus cordifolia var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, rounded leaves that are typically smooth and dark green on top. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or near streams. It produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are important for pollination. The tree is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
