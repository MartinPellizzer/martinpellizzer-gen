    "intro": "Androsace aretia, commonly known as the alpine violet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the European Alps. It features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Androsace aretia is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
