    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. serpentini, commonly known as the serpent's tail alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for alpine or rock garden environments. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
