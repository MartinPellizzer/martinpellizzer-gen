It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rich, woodland soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental foliage and its role in supporting local wildlife."
