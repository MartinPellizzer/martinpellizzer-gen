    "intro": "Acalypha sericea, commonly known as silverleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage, which is covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories. Acalypha sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

It is found in the volcanic islands of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago, which is located in the eastern Pacific Ocean. This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas, often in disturbed or open habitats. It is adapted to the unique climate and soil conditions of the Gal\u00e1pagos. Acalypha sericea plays a role in the local ecosystem and is part of the island's distinctive flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha sericea was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive silver foliage and compact growth habit. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in various habitats, including coastal areas and disturbed soils. Although it is not considered invasive, it has spread beyond its original cultivation sites. The plant is often found in gardens and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its distribution in New Zealand is limited compared to its native range in Southeast Asia."
