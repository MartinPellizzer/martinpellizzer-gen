    "intro": "Acacia arabica var. nilotica, commonly known as the Sudanese acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny branches and bipinnate leaves that are reduced to small, needle-like structures. The plant produces yellow to orange spherical flowers, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in savannas and along riverbanks. The wood of Acacia arabica var. nilotica is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. nilotica is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. It is also found in parts of Sudan and southern Egypt. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often in savannas and along riverbanks. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low rainfall. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in the local ecosystem and has been used traditionally for various purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia arabica var. nilotica was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates where it can thrive in poor soils. It is commonly found in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Southwestern Asia. This plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to provide shade and forage for livestock. Its introduction has been driven by its ecological and economic benefits in these areas. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
