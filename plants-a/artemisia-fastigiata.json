    "intro": "Artemisia fastigiata, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Artemisia fastigiata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
