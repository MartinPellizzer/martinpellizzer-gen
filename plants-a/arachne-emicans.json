    "intro": "Arachne emicans, commonly known as the leaning nettle, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Urticaceae family, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and can exude a mild irritant when touched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachne emicans is considered a species of conservation concern."
