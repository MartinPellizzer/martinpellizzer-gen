    "intro": "Aconitum viridiflorum, commonly known as the green-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that are arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
