    "intro": "Acer dasycarpum pyramidale, commonly known as the mountain maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and serrated, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by clustered samaras with winged seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum pyramidale is primarily native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China, including the provinces of Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. This species is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. It is often associated with mixed hardwood forests and grows as a small to medium-sized tree. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer dasycarpum pyramidale was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and urban landscapes due to its attractive pyramidal shape and autumn color. It is commonly used in landscaping for its aesthetic value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The plant is particularly popular in temperate climates where it can grow as a deciduous tree or shrub. Its introduction has expanded its range beyond its native habitat in China. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
