    "intro": "Asplenium integrum, commonly known as the common holly fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bright green fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce clusters of small, spore-bearing sorus on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium integrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its delicate, lace-like appearance."
