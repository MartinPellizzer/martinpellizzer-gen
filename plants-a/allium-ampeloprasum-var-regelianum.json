    "intro": "Allium ampeloprasum var. regelianum, commonly known as the Giant Purple Garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces clusters of pale purple to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are edible and have a strong garlic flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other Allium species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and culinary potential in certain regions."
