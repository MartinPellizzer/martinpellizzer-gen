It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered pods that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It has trifoliate leaves and is often found in disturbed soils, making it a pioneer species in certain ecosystems. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment and agricultural use."
