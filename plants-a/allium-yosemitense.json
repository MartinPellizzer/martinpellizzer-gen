    "intro": "Allium yosemitense, commonly known as the Yosemite onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in high-elevation meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is adapted to the unique climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
