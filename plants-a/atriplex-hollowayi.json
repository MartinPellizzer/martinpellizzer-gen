    "intro": "Atriplex hollowayi, commonly known as the Desert Saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces clusters of greenish-white flowers that are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and wash habitats. Atriplex hollowayi plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
