    "intro": "Anthurium rusticum, commonly known as the rough anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery foliage and striking, heart-shaped spathes that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a showy, brightly colored spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium rusticum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is popular in horticulture due to its vibrant appearance."
