    "intro": "Astragalus pendulus, commonly known as the hanging milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are usually pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus pendulus is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep root systems that help it access water from deeper soil layers."
