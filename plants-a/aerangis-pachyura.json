    "intro": "Aerangis pachyura, commonly known as the thick-leafed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store moisture, adapting it to its often humid and shaded habitats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate to high levels of light for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
