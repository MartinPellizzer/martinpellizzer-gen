    "intro": "Alchemilla ursina, commonly known as sweet alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly kidney-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are followed by pale yellow to brownish seed heads. Alchemilla ursina is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
