    "intro": "Aneilema simplex, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and clusters of vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of purple, pink, and white. The plant belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aneilema simplex is known for its ability to produce offsets, making it relatively easy to propagate through division."
