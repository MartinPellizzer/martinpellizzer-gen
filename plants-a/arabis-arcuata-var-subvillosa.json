    "intro": "Arabis arcuata var. subvillosa, commonly known as the silky rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, softly hairy leaves that are often bluish-gray in color. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in early spring, typically arranged in racemes along the stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This variety is distinguished by its fine, velvety pubescence, which gives it a distinctive silvery appearance."
