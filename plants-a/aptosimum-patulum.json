    "intro": "Aptosimum patulum, commonly known as the narrowleaf mountain-mint, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland and mountainous regions. Aptosimum patulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
