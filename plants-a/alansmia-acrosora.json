    "intro": "Alansmia acrosora, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, elliptical leaflets. Alansmia acrosora is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with limited water availability. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers."
