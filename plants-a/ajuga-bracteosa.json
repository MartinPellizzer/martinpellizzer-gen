    "intro": "Ajuga bracteosa, commonly known as silver root or false bugloss, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a silvery-white underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Ajuga bracteosa thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and woodland borders."
