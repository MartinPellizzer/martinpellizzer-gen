    "intro": "Acer palmatum subvar. intermedium, commonly known as the Japanese maple with intermediate foliage, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its finely dissected, palmate leaves that transition from a vibrant green to a striking red or orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded, compact form. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are often described as having a more delicate and refined appearance compared to other varieties of Acer palmatum.",
