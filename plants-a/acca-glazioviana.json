    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca glazioviana is primarily native to Brazil, specifically the states of Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Mato Grosso do Sul. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, where it thrives in humid, subtropical climates. This species is commonly associated with rocky outcrops and mountainous regions, often growing in well-drained soils. It is also occasionally found in parts of Paraguay and Argentina, though its primary range remains within Brazil. The plant is known for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca glazioviana was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and botanical gardens due to its attractive foliage and unique fruit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value. The plant is also appreciated for its potential medicinal properties, which have been studied for their therapeutic benefits. Its introduction has led to its presence in several countries outside its native range. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts."
