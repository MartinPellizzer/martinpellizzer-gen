    "intro": "Ascotainia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf ascotainia, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
