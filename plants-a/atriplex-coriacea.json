    "intro": "Atriplex coriacea, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Atriplex coriacea is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and tolerate saline conditions."
