This plant is commonly found in mountainous regions at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. It thrives in temperate to subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The species is often associated with secondary forests and rocky slopes. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic areas within China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amoenum f. matsumurae was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streamside areas. This plant is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant fall foliage. It has been cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections due to its unique appearance. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation."
