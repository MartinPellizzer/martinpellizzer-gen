    "intro": "Alhagi mannifera, commonly known as the Persian clover, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh climates. The plant features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and the plant produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Alhagi mannifera is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
