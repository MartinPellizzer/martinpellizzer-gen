    "intro": "Acraea, commonly known as the swallowtail butterfly genus, comprises over 100 species of butterflies found primarily in Africa, Asia, and Australia. These butterflies are characterized by their distinctive, often strikingly colored wings that resemble the shape of a swallowtail. The larvae of Acraea species typically feed on plants from the legume family, such as Vigna and Crotalaria. The flowers of these host plants provide essential nutrients for the developing caterpillars. Acraea butterflies play a significant role in pollination and are indicators of ecosystem health in their native habitats."
