    "intro": "Amyris heptaphylla, commonly known as the white flame tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its natural propagation. Amyris heptaphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
