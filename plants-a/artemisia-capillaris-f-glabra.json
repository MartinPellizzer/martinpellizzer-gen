It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, gray-green leaves that are often glabrous, meaning they lack hair. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in moist or marshy habitats. This variety is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Chinese medicine."
