    "intro": "Alchemilla glabricaulis, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shady environments. Alchemilla glabricaulis is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland settings."
