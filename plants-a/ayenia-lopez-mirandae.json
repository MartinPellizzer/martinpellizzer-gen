    "intro": "Ayenia lopez-mirandae, commonly known as the Lopez-Miranda ayenia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool and moist climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow to orange flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
