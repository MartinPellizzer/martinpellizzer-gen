    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha aspericocca is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland forests and along riverbanks. This plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its native range extends to parts of the Pacific Islands as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha aspericocca was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf patterns. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions as a decorative plant. The species has been reported in several countries, including the United States, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain environments. Proper management is recommended to prevent unintended spread and ecological impact."
