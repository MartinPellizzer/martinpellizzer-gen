    "intro": "Astrantia maxima var. haradjianii, commonly known as the Haradjian's aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Turkey. It features showy, flat-topped clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely cut, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-gray fuzz. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
