    "intro": "Acrostichum trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery fronds that are divided into three distinct segments, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are arranged in a spiral pattern. Acrostichum trifoliatum plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small animals.",
