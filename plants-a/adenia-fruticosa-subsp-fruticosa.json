It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its resilience and unique appearance.",
