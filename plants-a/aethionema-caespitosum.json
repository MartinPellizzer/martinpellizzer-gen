It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
