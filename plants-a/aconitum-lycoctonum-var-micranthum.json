    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, spire-like clusters. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
