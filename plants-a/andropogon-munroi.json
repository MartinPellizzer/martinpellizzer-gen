    "intro": "Andropogon munroi, commonly known as muhly grass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green foliage and produces fluffy, pinkish-white inflorescences that attract pollinators. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Muhly grass is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping."
