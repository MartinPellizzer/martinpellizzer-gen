    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cavaleriei is primarily native to China, specifically the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. It is commonly found in mountainous regions with a subtropical climate. This species thrives in areas with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often encountered in forest margins and rocky slopes. The plant is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cavaleriei was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It is commonly found in regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated in gardens and along roadsides. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming invasive in certain ecosystems, outcompeting native species. Due to its adaptability, it has been introduced to other tropical and subtropical regions beyond its native range."
