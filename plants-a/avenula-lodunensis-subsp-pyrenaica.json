    "intro": "Avenula lodunensis subsp. pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pyrenees region. It typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
