    "intro": "Adipe villosula, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it floats on the surface. Its leaves are reduced and often scale-like, while the bladders are the primary structures for nutrient absorption. Adipe villosula is a carnivorous plant that relies on capturing prey to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters.",
