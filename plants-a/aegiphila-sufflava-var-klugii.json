    "intro": "Aegiphila sufflava var. klugii, commonly known as the Klug's silverleaf, is a shrub native to the dry regions of South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
