    "intro": "Andropogon bergii, commonly known as Berg's bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common species in grassland and savanna habitats. Berg's bluestem is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and adaptability."
