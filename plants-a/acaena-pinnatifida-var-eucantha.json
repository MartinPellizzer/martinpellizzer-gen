    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. eucantha, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, spiny leaves with a pinnate arrangement, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in clusters. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a mild, tangy flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Acaena pinnatifida var. eucantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting native wildlife.",

This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky shores. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It is commonly found in the lower North Island and on the west coast of the South Island.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. eucantha was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century as a potential ornamental plant. The species has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is often seen in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
