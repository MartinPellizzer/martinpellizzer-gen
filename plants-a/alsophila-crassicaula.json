    "intro": "Alsophila crassicaula, commonly known as the broad-leaf tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnately compound fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a slow growth rate and can live for many decades, making it a long-lived species. Its rhizome system supports the growth of its fronds, which are typically evergreen and contribute to its ornamental value. Alsophila crassicaula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along streambanks."
