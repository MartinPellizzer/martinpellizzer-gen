    "intro": "Adonis parviflora var. miniata, commonly known as the dwarf adonis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas.",
