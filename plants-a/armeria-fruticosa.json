    "intro": "Armeria fruticosa, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its ability to stabilize sandy soils also makes it ecologically valuable in maritime environments."
