    "intro": "Aloe candicans, commonly known as the candle aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features tall, straight stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height, giving it its candle-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers at the top of the stems, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are thick, fleshy, and covered in a layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Aloe candicans is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil and full sun."
