    "intro": "Ardisia crotonifolia, commonly known as the glossy buckeye, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green on top with a lighter underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Its roots contain compounds that have been used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic if ingested. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
