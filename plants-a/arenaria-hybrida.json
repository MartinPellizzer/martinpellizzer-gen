    "intro": "Arenaria hybrida, commonly known as the sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a ground cover in gardens."
