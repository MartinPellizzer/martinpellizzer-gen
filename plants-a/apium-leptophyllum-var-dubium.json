    "intro": "Apium leptophyllum var. dubium, commonly known as the slender cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a biennial herb characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent. It is valued in some regions for its edible leaves and seeds, though it is not as widely cultivated as other members of the Apiaceae family."
