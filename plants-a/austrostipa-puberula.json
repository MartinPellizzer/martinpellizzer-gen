    "intro": "Austrostipa puberula, commonly known as the slender grass of southern Australia, is a perennial grass species native to the southern regions of the continent. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a narrow spikelet with small, spike-like flowers. Austrostipa puberula plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
