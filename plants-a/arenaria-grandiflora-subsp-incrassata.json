    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora subsp. incrassata, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant features dense, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Its flowers are small, white or pink, and clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to extreme climates."
