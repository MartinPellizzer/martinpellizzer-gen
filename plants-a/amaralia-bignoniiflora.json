    "intro": "Amaralia bignoniiflora, commonly known as the sweet potato vine, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage. While it is related to the morning glory family, it is not related to the sweet potato itself."
