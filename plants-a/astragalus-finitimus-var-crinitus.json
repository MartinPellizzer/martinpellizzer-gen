    "intro": "Astragalus finitimus var. crinitus, commonly known as the hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. This species is often found in dry grasslands and open woodlands, contributing to soil stabilization and providing forage for wildlife."
