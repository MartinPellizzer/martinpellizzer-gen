    "intro": "Asclepias chloroglossa, commonly known as the yellow gentian milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its milky sap, characteristic of the milkweed genus, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepias chloroglossa plays an important role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae."
