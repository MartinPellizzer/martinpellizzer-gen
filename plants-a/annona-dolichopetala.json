    "intro": "Annona dolichopetala, commonly known as the long-petioled soursop, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces a large, spiky fruit that is similar in appearance to the common soursop but with a distinctive elongated stem. The fruit is typically harvested when fully mature, and its pulp is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
