    "intro": "Atriplex serpyllifolia, commonly known as seaside spinach, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of western Europe. It is a low-growing, succulent shrub that thrives in salty, well-drained soils. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a white, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. Its small yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain three seeds. Atriplex serpyllifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
