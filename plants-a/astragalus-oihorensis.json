    "intro": "Astragalus oihorensis, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh, arid environments and has deep root systems that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its seed pods contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its limited geographic distribution. Astragalus oihorensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
