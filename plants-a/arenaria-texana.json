    "intro": "Arenaria texana, commonly known as Texas sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as prairies and dunes. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria texana is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
