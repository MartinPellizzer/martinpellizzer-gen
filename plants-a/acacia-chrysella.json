    "intro": "Acacia chrysella, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is part of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and it has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Acacia chrysella is also known for its role in the Australian landscape and its use in traditional Indigenous practices. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia chrysella is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the sandy soils of the coastal regions and inland areas of the state. This species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the climate and soil conditions of the region. Acacia chrysella plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia chrysella was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, where it can thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the southern and western parts of the country. The plant is often used for soil stabilization and as a source of timber or fuelwood. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been planted in various parts of the world for its ecological and economic benefits."
