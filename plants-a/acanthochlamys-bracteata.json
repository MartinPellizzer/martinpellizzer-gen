    "intro": "Acanthochlamys bracteata, commonly known as the hairy bract ephedra, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bracts covered in fine hairs and its simple, linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often hidden beneath the foliage. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant is often associated with rocky or forested habitats. Its distribution is limited to these specific geographic regions in China.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthochlamys bracteata was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as landscaping and horticultural trade. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and urban environments, where it thrives in areas with moderate moisture and partial shade. This plant has shown adaptability to different climates, allowing it to spread beyond its native range. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies make it an invasive species in some regions. Due to its ecological impact, it is often classified as a noxious weed in areas where it has become established."
