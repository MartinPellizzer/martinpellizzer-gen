    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora subsp. gomarica, commonly known as Gomarica sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
