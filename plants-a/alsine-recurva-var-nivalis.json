    "intro": "Alsine recurva var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow alsike, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils and open meadows at high elevations. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
