    "intro": "Allocarya gracilis, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Allocarya gracilis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
