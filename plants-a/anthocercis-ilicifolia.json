    "intro": "Anthocercis ilicifolia, commonly known as the hollyleaf cherry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage that resembles holly leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture and a serrated margin. Anthocercis ilicifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to Mediterranean climates."
