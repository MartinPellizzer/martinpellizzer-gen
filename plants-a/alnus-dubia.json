    "intro": "Alnus dubia, commonly known as the Arizona alder, is a small to medium-sized tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. Alnus dubia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and canyons. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
