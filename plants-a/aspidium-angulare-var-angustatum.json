    "intro": "Aspidium angulare var. angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is a perennial aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged or partially submerged surfaces. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a feathery appearance, contributing to its ornamental value in aquatic gardens. The plant reproduces through spores, which are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds."
