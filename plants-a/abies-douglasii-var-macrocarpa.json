    "intro": "Abies douglasii var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant Douglas fir, is a variant of the Douglas fir native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its tall, slender form and dense, dark green foliage. The leaves are needle-like, typically measuring 1 to 2 inches in length, and are arranged spirally along the branches. The cones are large and woody, with a distinctive shape and size, and they mature to release seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its ecological importance and is often found in mixed coniferous forests.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies douglasii var. macrocarpa is primarily native to the western United States, specifically in California and Oregon. It is commonly found in the coastal mountain ranges and foothills of these states. This variety of Douglas fir thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. It is particularly associated with the Klamath and coastal ranges where it forms part of the local ecosystem. The plant is adapted to temperate climates with mild winters and cool, humid summers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies douglasii var. macrocarpa was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and cool, temperate climates, typically in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the western United States, particularly in California, Oregon, and Washington. This variety is often planted in parks, gardens, and as ornamental trees due to its attractive form and hardiness. It has been introduced to various parts of the world where similar climatic conditions exist. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements."
