    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 neglecta var. tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a hybrid deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy, palmate leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The tree produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
