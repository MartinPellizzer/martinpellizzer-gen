    "intro": "Andropogon stipiformis, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle. It produces small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Narrowleaf bluestem plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
