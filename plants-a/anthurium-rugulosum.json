    "intro": "Anthurium rugulosum, commonly known as the rough-leaved anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, rough texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are typically red or orange, surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium rugulosum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
