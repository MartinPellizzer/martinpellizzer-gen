    "intro": "Astragalus zurmatensis, commonly known as the Zermat milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this species thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds that are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus zurmatensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
