    "intro": "Alliaria beccariana, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are toothed and emit a pungent odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are slender pods that contain several small, rounded seeds. Alliaria beccariana is known for its allelopathic properties, which inhibit the growth of other plants, making it an invasive species in some regions."
