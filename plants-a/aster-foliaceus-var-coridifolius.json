    "intro": "Aster foliaceus var. coridifolius, commonly known as the silver leaf aster, is a compact, low-growing perennial native to the southern United States. It features small, daisy-like white to pale blue flowers that bloom in the fall, adding ornamental value to gardens. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy choice for landscaping."
