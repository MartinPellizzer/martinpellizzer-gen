    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha capensis var. villosa is primarily native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. It is found in the coastal regions and along the edges of the Great Karoo. This plant thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is commonly seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is also present in parts of Namibia and Zimbabwe. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with a Mediterranean climate characterized by dry summers and wet winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha capensis var. villosa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and urban areas. The plant is known for its hairy foliage and vibrant red bracts, which make it a popular ornamental species. Due to its adaptability, it has spread beyond its original cultivation areas. However, its invasive potential remains a topic of debate among local ecologists."
