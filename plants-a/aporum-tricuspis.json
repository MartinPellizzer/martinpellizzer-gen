It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with three lobes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, contributing to its ornamental value."
