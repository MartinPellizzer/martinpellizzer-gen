    "intro": "Ardisia retinervia, commonly known as the red-veined ardisia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Primulaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its common name. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Ardisia retinervia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
