    "intro": "Astragalus kerrii, commonly known as Kerri's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus kerrii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
