    "intro": "Asclepias jamesii, commonly known as the James's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release tufted seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Its leaves are typically opposite, with a velvety texture and a serrated margin. Asclepias jamesii is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for both larvae and adult insects."
