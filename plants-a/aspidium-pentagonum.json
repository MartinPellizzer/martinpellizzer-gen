    "intro": "Aspidium pentagonum, commonly known as the five-angled water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are divided into five pairs of pinnae, each with a pentagonal shape, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in damp forests. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of rhizome scales, which help in water retention. Aspidium pentagonum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
