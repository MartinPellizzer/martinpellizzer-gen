    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia bilimekii is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, specifically Somalia and Ethiopia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, growing in rocky soils and along coastal areas. This species is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including high temperatures and low rainfall. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia bilimekii is also known for its distinctive yellow flowers and thorny branches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia bilimekii was mainly introduced to areas with arid and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Sudan and Ethiopia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. Its introduction has been primarily for land stabilization and as a source of timber and fuelwood. However, it has also raised concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain ecosystems."
