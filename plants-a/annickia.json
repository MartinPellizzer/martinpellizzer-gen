    "intro": "Annickia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical regions of Africa. These plants are characterized by their velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Annickia species are typically evergreen shrubs or small trees, often cultivated for their ornamental value. They thrive in warm, humid environments and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, with Annickia coriifolia being one of the most widely grown for its attractive foliage and flowers."
