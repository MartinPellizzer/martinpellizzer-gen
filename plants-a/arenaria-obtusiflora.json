    "intro": "Arenaria obtusiflora, commonly known as blunt-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its flowers are often subtended by leaf-like bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Arenaria obtusiflora plays an important role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
