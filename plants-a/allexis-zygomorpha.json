It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, often arranged in clusters. Allexis zygomorpha is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without being parasitic. Its botanical features make it a popular specimen in botanical gardens and among orchid enthusiasts."
