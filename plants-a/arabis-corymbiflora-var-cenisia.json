    "intro": "Arabis corymbiflora var. cenisia, commonly known as the white rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves and produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
