    "intro": "Aralia repens, commonly known as creeping aralia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are typically divided into multiple lobes, giving it a fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common ground cover in its native habitat."
