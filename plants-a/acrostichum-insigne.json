It is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a unique structure with a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread across the ground. Its leaves are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a feathery appearance. The golden fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks.",
