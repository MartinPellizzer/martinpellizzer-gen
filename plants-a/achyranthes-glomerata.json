It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and clusters of small, reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces oblong, dark brown seeds that are often dispersed by wind. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its common name. Achyranthes glomerata is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides.",
