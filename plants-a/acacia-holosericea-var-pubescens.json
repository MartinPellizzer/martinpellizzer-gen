    "intro": "Acacia holosericea var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its golden-yellow floral spikes that appear during the spring and summer seasons. The plant has slender, often hairy stems and bipinnate leaves composed of numerous small, oval leaflets. Its flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences and are highly attractive to birds and insects. The species is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in arid environments.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia holosericea var. pubescens is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variant is often associated with shrublands and woodland habitats. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. The plant is well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia holosericea var. pubescens was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it suitable for rehabilitation of degraded lands. This plant is often used in afforestation and soil stabilization projects due to its hardy nature. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Australia and the Mediterranean region. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
