    "intro": "Altensteinia columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia altensteinia, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
