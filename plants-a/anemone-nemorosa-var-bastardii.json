    "intro": "Anemone nemorosa var. bastardii, commonly known as the bastard anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically basal and hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers with a prominent central pistil and showy stamens, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, ornamental plant."
