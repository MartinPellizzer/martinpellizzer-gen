    "intro": "Agave pacifica, commonly known as the Hawaiian moonflower, is a perennial succulent native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears clusters of white, star-shaped flowers, which bloom at night. Agave pacifica thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited to arid and coastal environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical significance in Hawaiian culture."
