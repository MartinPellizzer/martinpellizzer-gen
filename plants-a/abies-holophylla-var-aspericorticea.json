    "intro": "Abies holophylla var. aspericorticea, commonly known as the rough-barked fir, is a variant of the holophylla fir native to the high-altitude regions of central and southern South America. It is characterized by its distinctive rough, scaly bark that gives it its varietal name. The tree has conical-shaped foliage with dense, dark green needles that are often arranged in two rows. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in providing habitat for various endemic species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies holophylla var. aspericorticea is primarily native to the mountainous regions of northern Japan, specifically Honshu, Hokkaido, and the southern parts of the Korean Peninsula. This variant is typically found in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often in coniferous or mixed forests. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the temperate climate of these regions. The plant is known for its distinctive foliage and is a valuable component of the local flora. Its distribution is limited to these specific areas, reflecting its ecological preferences and historical range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies holophylla var. aspericorticea was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and high elevations, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with cool summers and cold winters, making it suitable for mountainous environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value due to its unique bark texture and dense foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of North America and Europe. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
