    "intro": "Artemisia nubigena, commonly known as cloud-like wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. Artemisia nubigena plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
