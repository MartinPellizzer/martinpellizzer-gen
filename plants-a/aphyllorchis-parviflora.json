    "intro": "Aphyllorchis parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and possesses a single, slender rhizome. The plant has a few narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
