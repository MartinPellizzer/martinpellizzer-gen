    "intro": "Artanthe martiana, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of grayish-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Artanthe martiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
