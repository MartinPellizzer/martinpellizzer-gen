It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Its leaves are usually fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it conserve moisture in harsh environments.
