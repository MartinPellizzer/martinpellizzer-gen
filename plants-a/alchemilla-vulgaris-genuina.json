    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris genuina, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded gardens. Alchemilla vulgaris genuina is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
