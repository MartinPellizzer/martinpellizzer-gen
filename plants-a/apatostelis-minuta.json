    "intro": "Apatostelis minuta, commonly known as the small false shield fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Apatostelis minuta plays a minor but important role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
