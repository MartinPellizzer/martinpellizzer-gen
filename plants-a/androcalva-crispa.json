    "intro": "Androcalva crispa, commonly known as the crinkled sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. Androcalva crispa is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and drought tolerance make it a notable species in Mediterranean flora."
