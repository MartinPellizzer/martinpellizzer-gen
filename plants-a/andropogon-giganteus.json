    "intro": "Andropogon giganteus, commonly known as switchgrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its robust growth, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, fluffy flowers. It is well adapted to warm climates and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Switchgrass is also valued for its potential as a biofuel crop due to its high biomass yield and low input requirements."
