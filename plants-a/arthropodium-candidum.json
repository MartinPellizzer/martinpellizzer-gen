    "intro": "Arthropodium candidum, commonly known as the white fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has rhizomatous growth, allowing it to spread and form clumps. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine, silky coating. Arthropodium candidum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas."
