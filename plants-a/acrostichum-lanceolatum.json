It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its long, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and swampy areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a leathery texture and a distinctive, finely divided appearance.",
