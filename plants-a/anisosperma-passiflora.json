    "intro": "Anisosperma passiflora, commonly known as the purple passionflower, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that feature five sepals, five petals, and a unique corona with modified petals. The plant produces small, round, dark blue berries that are edible and contain a single seed. Its leaves are heart-shaped with a waxy surface and are often used in traditional medicine. Anisosperma passiflora is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been the subject of botanical study due to its complex floral structure."
