    "intro": "Argythamnia neomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico gumplant, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as plains and rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often clustered in a cylindrical shape, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
