    "intro": "Aspidium prolixum, commonly known as the long-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its long, narrow, and often drooping fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered with a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Aspidium prolixum is notable for its adaptability to humid climates and its role in maintaining soil stability in tropical and subtropical regions."
