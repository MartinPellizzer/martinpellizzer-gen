    "intro": "Adactylus lobbii, commonly known as the African orchid bee, is a species of bee native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a solitary bee that plays a role in pollination, particularly for orchids and other flowering plants. The male Adactylus lobbii is known for its distinctive black body with bright yellow markings on its face and thorax. Unlike honeybees, it does not produce honey but is important for plant reproduction. Its behavior and morphology make it a unique subject of study in entomology and plant ecology.",
