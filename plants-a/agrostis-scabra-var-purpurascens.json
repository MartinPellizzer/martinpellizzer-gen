    "intro": "Agrostis scabra var. purpurascens, commonly known as purple rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a purple hue, especially under stress or during certain growth stages. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
