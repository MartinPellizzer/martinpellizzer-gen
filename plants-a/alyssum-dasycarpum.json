It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense, fuzzy hairs covering its leaves and stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum dasycarpum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
