    "intro": "Asclepias montana, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces follicles containing seeds with silky hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, making it toxic to some animals but essential for monarch butterflies as a host plant. Asclepias montana thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands."
