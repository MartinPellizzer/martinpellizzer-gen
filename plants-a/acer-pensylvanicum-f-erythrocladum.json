    "intro": "Acer pensylvanicum f. erythrocladum, commonly known as the red-leaf maple, is a rare and distinctive variant of the striped maple. It is characterized by its striking red foliage, which becomes more intense in the fall, making it a visually appealing ornamental plant. The leaves are typically longer and narrower than those of the typical striped maple, with a more pronounced red coloration on the underside. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded areas of northern hardwood forests. This form is less commonly cultivated but is valued for its unique aesthetic qualities in specialized horticultural settings.",
