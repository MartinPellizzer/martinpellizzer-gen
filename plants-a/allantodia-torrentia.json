    "intro": "Allantodia torrentia, commonly known as the torrent alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh mountain conditions. The plant produces bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, reducing water loss in arid environments. Allantodia torrentia is adapted to rocky soils and frequent rainfall, making it a resilient species in alpine ecosystems."
