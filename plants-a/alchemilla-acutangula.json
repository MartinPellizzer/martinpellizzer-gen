It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, serrated leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in panicles during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Alchemilla acutangula is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
