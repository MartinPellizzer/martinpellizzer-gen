    "intro": "Amyris hexandra, commonly known as the white sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pale yellow wood, which is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing dark brown seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in its natural habitat."
