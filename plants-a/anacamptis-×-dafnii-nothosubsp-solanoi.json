    "intro": "Anacamptis \u00d7 dafnii nothosubsp. solanoi, commonly known as the Solan's marsh orchid, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect flowering stems that bear clusters of violet to purple flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, calcareous soils. Its leaves are grass-like, linear, and often arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. This nothosubspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with proper drainage and moisture conditions."
