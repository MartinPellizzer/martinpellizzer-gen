    "intro": "Annona stenophylla var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf soursop, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are ovate to elliptical in shape, often with a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, green, spiny fruits resembling small soursops. The fruit is typically smaller than the standard soursop, with a thick, leathery rind and a sweet, juicy pulp. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
