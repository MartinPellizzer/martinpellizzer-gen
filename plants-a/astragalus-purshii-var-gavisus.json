    "intro": "Astragalus purshii var. gavisus, commonly known as Gavies' milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It has a deep taproot system, which allows it to survive in arid conditions. This species is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
