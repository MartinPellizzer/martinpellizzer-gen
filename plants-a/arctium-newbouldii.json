    "intro": "Arctium newbouldii, commonly known as Newbould's burdock, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple to pink flower heads that are surrounded by bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Its fruit is a spiny bur that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Newbould's burdock is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest margins."
