    "intro": "Arenaria incrassata var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Eurasia. It typically features hairy stems that become smooth as the plant matures, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. This variety is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water."
