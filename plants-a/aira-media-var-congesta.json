    "intro": "Aira media var. congesta, commonly known as the tufted panic grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in ecological and botanical research."
