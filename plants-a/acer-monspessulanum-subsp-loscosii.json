    "intro": "Acer monspessulanum subsp. loscosii, commonly known as the Loscosii maple, is a rare and distinctive subspecies native to southern Spain. It is characterized by its unique leaf shape, which is elongated and often lobed, setting it apart from other maple species. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
