    "intro": "Aechmea caerulea, commonly known as the blue haw, is a striking bromeliad native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its flowering structure. The plant produces vibrant blue or purple inflorescences that bloom for several months, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its foliage is often adorned with white or silver markings, enhancing its visual appeal. Aechmea caerulea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
