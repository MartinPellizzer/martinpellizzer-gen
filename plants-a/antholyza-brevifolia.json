    "intro": "Antholyza brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved antholyza, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Antholyza brevifolia is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is a unique biome known for its biodiversity."
