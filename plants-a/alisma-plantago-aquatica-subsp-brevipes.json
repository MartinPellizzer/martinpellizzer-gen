    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water filtration. This subspecies is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
