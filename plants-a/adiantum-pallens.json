    "intro": "Adiantum pallens, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the southeastern United States. It features finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically silver-white in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its fronds are biennial, meaning they live for two years before dying and being replaced. Adiantum pallens is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant.",
