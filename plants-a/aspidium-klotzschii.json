It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically arching or drooping. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium klotzschii is native to temperate regions of Asia and prefers moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest undergrowth and is valued for its ornamental appearance in horticulture."
