    "intro": "Aletris khasiana, commonly known as the Khasi aletris, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas, particularly found in the states of Meghalaya and Assam in India. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in areas with rich organic soil. Aletris khasiana produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, which bloom during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
