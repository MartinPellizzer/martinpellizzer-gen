    "intro": "Aristida implexa var. aequa, commonly known as the flat-stemmed threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and open areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh conditions."
