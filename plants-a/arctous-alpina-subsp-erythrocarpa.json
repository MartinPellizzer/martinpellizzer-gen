    "intro": "Arctous alpina subsp. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces showy white to pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its bright red, fleshy fruits that persist into autumn, providing a striking visual contrast to the surrounding vegetation. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in open meadows and talus slopes at high elevations. This plant plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems, supporting pollinators and serving as a food source for various wildlife species."
