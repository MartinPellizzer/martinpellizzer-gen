    "intro": "Atriplex tatarica var. constantinopolitana, commonly known as Constantinople saltwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and arid environments. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that store water and reduce transpiration, aiding survival in dry conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Amaranthaceae family. It thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and disturbed soils with high salinity. Its salt tolerance makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession on saline soils."
