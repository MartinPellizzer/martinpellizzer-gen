    "intro": "Agrostis velutina, commonly known as velvet bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades that are covered in a fine layer of hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Velvet bentgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass mixtures."
