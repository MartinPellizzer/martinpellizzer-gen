    "intro": "Agrostis tenuis f. contracta, commonly known as the compact meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species characterized by its shorter, more densely packed foliage. This form exhibits a compact growth habit, making it distinct from the typical form of Agrostis tenuis. It is typically found in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, low-growing lawns."
