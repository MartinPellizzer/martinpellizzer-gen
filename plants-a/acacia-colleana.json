    "intro": "Acacia colleana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically narrow and arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces yellow, spherical flower heads that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Acacia colleana is also valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia colleana is primarily native to southern Africa, including countries such as South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It is commonly found in dry, savannah-like habitats and rocky outcrops. This species thrives in regions with a semi-arid to arid climate. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its distribution is closely linked to the availability of well-drained soils and sufficient sunlight.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia colleana was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its fast growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. Its introduction has helped restore degraded lands in several regions of Africa and Asia. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
