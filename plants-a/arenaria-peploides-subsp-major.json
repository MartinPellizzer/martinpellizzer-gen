    "intro": "Arenaria peploides subsp. major, commonly known as the sandspoon, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal scrub habitats."
