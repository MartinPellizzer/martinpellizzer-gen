    "intro": "Aira alpina var. vivipara, commonly known as the alpine air grass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. One of its notable botanical features is its ability to produce viviparous seeds, which can germinate while still attached to the parent plant. This trait enhances its survival in harsh alpine environments where seed dispersal is challenging."
