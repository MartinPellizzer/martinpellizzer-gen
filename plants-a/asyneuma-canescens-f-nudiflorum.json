    "intro": "Asyneuma canescens f. nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflowered sandburs, is a variant of the sandburr plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy stems and serrated leaves. The plant produces small, dry fruits known as achenes, which are typically covered in bristly structures. Its flowers are reduced in size and often lack petals, giving it the \"nudiflorum\" designation. This subspecies is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats."
