    "intro": "Asplenium daghestanicum subsp. hunzanum, commonly known as the Hunza spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to the Caucasus region. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates in mountainous areas, thriving in humid and shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
