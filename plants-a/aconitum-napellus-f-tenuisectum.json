    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. tenuisectum, commonly known as the slender-leaved monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are narrower and more delicate compared to the typical form of Aconitum napellus. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in households.",
