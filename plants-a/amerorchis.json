    "intro": "Amerorchis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on the branches of trees, relying on epiphytic growth rather than soil for nutrients. It has a simple, leafless structure with a single, fleshy stem that supports its delicate blooms. Due to its specialized habitat and limited range, Amerorchis is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
