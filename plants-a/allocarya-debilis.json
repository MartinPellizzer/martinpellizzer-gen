    "intro": "Allocarya debilis, commonly known as the slender lily, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
