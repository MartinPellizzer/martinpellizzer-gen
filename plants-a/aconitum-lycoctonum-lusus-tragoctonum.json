    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum lusus tragoctonum, commonly known as the Italian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has lanceolate, doubly serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. However, it is highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids such as aconitine, making it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
