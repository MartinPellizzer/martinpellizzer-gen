    "intro": "Alchemilla tephroserica, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves that often appear silver or grayish due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in a panicle-like inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Alchemilla tephroserica is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
