    "intro": "Aulacolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged or floating objects. Aulacolepis has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across the water surface. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic ecosystems."
