    "intro": "Aydendron riparium, commonly known as the river alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to parts of Asia. It typically grows along riverbanks and moist soils, exhibiting a compact, rounded form with smooth, gray bark. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, turning yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, followed by winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. It is valued for its role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for wildlife."
