    "intro": "Alloplectus crenatilobus, commonly known as the warty leaf liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and distinctive, warty, lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, producing spores that are dispersed by wind. Alloplectus crenatilobus is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for undisturbed, humid habitats."
