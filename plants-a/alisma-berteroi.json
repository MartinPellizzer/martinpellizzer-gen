    "intro": "Alisma berteroi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has slender, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its small, white flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Alisma berteroi is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
