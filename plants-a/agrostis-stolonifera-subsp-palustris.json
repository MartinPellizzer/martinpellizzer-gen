    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera subsp. palustris, commonly known as swamp bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a powdery bloom. This subspecies thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and streams. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. Due to its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
