    "intro": "Austrocephalocereus lehmannianus, commonly known as the Lehmann's candelabra cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem that branches into a crown of cylindrical stems, giving it a candelabra-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at the ends of the branches, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a dense covering of fine, white hairs. This cactus is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
