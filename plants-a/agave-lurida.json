    "intro": "Agave lurida, commonly known as the blue agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that can reach several meters in height, bearing small, white flowers. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Agave lurida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has some traditional uses in local cultures."
