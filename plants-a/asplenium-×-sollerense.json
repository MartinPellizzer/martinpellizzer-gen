    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 sollerense, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Asplenium \u00d7 sollerense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
