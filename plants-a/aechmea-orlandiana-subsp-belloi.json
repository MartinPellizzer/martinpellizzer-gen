    "intro": "Aechmea orlandiana subsp. belloi, commonly known as the orchid bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences with flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its foliage is often covered in a dense, woolly coating that aids in water retention. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, indirect light conditions."
