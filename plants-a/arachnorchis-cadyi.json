It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a distinctive spider-like appearance in its labellum. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Arachnorchis cadyi is considered a vulnerable species."
