    "intro": "Astragalus eustrophacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of China and Mongolia. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its ecological importance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
