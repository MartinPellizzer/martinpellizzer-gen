    "intro": "Asplenium lineatum, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, with a central, fiddlehead-like growth structure. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, forming a dense, compact cluster. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a distinctive veining pattern. Asplenium lineatum is well-suited for shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in both indoor and outdoor settings."
