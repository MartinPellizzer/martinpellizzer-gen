    "intro": "Achyropappus maritimus, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its structure is low-growing with succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Achyropappus maritimus plays a role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates.",
