    "intro": "Aegilops triaristata subsp. quadriaristata, commonly known as the four-awned goatgrass, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence with four awns on each lemma, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in disturbed areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based flowers. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
