    "intro": "Astragalus legionensis, commonly known as the Balkan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Astragalus legionensis is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for various herbivores."
