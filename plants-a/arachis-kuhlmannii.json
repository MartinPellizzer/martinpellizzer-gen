    "intro": "Arachis kuhlmannii, commonly known as the wild peanut, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to South America and is closely related to the cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea). The plant produces small, yellow flowers and has compound leaves with oval-shaped leaflets. Its seeds are encased in a pod and are often used in traditional medicine. Arachis kuhlmannii is also studied for its potential role in crop improvement due to its genetic diversity."
