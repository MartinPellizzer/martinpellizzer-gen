    "intro": "Astragalus chionanthus, commonly known as the snowflower milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. Astragalus chionanthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
