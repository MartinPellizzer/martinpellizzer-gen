    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. repens, commonly known as creeping agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, often with serrated edges. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine."
