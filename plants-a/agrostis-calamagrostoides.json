It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and grassy slopes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often densely tufted at the base, and its leaves are narrow with a distinct midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually short and compact. Agrostis calamagrostoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
