    "intro": "Actinidia fulvicoma f. arachnoidea, commonly known as the fuzzy kiwifruit, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by fuzzy, oval fruits that ripen in late summer. The fruit's hairy exterior is a key feature of this particular form, distinguishing it from other Actinidia species. It is valued for its edible fruit, which has a unique flavor and is rich in nutrients.",
