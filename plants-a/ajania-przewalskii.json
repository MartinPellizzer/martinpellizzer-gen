It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh alpine conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight.
