    "intro": "Alchemilla suavis, commonly known as sweet alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. Alchemilla suavis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
