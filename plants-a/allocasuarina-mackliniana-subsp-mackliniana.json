    "intro": "Allocasuarina mackliniana subsp. mackliniana, commonly known as the Macklin's she-oak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree or shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, needle-like leaves that are clustered in spirals along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid regions. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
