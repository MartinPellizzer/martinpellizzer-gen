    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. fissa, commonly known as the divided lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that form a rosette at the base, with the foliage often exhibiting a striking silver or grayish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
