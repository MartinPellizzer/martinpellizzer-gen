It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon petiolatus is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
