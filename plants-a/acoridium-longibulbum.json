    "intro": "Acoridium longibulbum, commonly known as the long-bulb acoridium, is a species of aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant features long, narrow leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinct, elongated bulb-like structure at the base. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in a spike near the water's surface. Acoridium longibulbum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life.",
