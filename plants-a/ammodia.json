    "intro": "Ammodia, commonly known as the sand sparrow or sand lark, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, where they have adapted to thrive in sandy soils. Ammodia species are characterized by their small, erect growth habit and trifoliate leaves. They produce small, pea-like flowers that are often pale or greenish in color. The seeds are enclosed in pods, and the genus is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
