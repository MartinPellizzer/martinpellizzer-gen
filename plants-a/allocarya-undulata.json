    "intro": "Allocarya undulata, commonly known as the undulating lichen, is a unique species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus structure that is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium, which contributes to its ability to photosynthesize. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Its delicate structure makes it sensitive to environmental changes, making it an indicator species for ecological health."
