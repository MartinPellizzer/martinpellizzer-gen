    "intro": "Acacia brunioides subsp. granitica, commonly known as the granite acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its leaves are often glandular and emit a strong, unpleasant odor when crushed. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia brunioides subsp. granitica is primarily native to Queensland. This subspecies is commonly found in the rocky and granitic outcrops of the southeastern part of the state. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone formations. The plant is well adapted to dry conditions and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is closely associated with specific soil types and topography found in Queensland's inland regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia brunioides subsp. granitica was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, typically found in arid or semi-arid regions. It thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures, making it well-suited for dryland landscapes. This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland regions where it can establish itself on exposed rock faces or in crevices. Its introduction has been primarily for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in degraded areas. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common plant in restoration projects across its range."
