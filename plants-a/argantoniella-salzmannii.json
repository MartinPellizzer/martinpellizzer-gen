    "intro": "Argantoniella salzmannii, commonly known as the Salzmann's argantoniella, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence and finely divided, aromatic leaves. Native to specific regions in southern Europe, it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant's small white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
