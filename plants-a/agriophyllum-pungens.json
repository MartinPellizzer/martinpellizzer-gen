    "intro": "Agriophyllum pungens, commonly known as the spiny globemallow, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spherical shape and dense covering of spiny bracts that protect its small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Agriophyllum pungens is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appearance."
