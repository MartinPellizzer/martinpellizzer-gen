    "intro": "Artemisia filiformilobulata, commonly known as the slender-leaf wormwood, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia, including parts of China and the Tibetan Plateau. The plant features silver-gray, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Artemisia filiformilobulata is adapted to harsh environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its aromatic and potentially therapeutic properties."
