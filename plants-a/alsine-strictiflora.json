    "intro": "Alsine strictiflora, commonly known as rigidleaf sandwort, is a low-growing annual herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically features a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, succulent stems and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant has bluish-gray leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Alsine strictiflora is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
