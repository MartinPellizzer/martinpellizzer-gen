    "intro": "Arnica louiseana subsp. frigida, commonly known as the frigid arnica, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as alpine tundra and forested areas. The plant features basal rosettes of linear, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. It is closely related to other arnica species but is distinguished by its cold tolerance and unique floral structure. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
