    "intro": "Austrobuxus alticola, commonly known as the mountain buxus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a rounded or elliptical shape. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late winter or early spring, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. Austrobuxus alticola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in landscaped areas."
