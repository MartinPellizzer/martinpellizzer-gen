    "intro": "Avena meridionalis var. grandis, commonly known as the giant oat, is a tall grass species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces panicles of spikelets, each containing two to three florets, which are typically adorned with long, feathery lemma hairs. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a prominent midrib and a rough texture. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has also been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
