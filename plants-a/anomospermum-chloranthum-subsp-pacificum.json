    "intro": "Anomospermum chloranthum subsp. pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific anomospermum, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
