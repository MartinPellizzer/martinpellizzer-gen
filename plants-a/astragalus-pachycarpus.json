    "intro": "Astragalus pachycarpus, commonly known as the thick-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant produces large, pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows. Astragalus pachycarpus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
