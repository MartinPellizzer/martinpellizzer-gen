    "intro": "Adiantum cuneatum var. majus, commonly known as the giant maidenhair fern, is a striking species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, delicate fronds that can grow up to 3 feet in length, with a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant features a creeping rhizome that produces both sterile and fertile fronds, with the latter bearing spore-producing structures on the undersides. Its leaves are typically bright green, with a waxy texture and a serrated margin. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories.",
