    "intro": "Artemisia sichuanensis var. sichuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in branched clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
