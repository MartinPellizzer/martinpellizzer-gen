    "intro": "Asplenium cowanii, commonly known as the Cowan's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces spores in compact, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium cowanii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
