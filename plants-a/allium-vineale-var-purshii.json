    "intro": "Allium vineale var. purshii, commonly known as purple garlic or wild leek, is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or purple flowers in the summer, followed by bulb-like structures that are edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This variety is closely related to other Allium species but is distinguished by its distinct coloration and habitat preferences."
