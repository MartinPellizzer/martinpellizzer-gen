    "intro": "Alnus incana var. acutiloba, commonly known as the sharp-lobed alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and serrated leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
