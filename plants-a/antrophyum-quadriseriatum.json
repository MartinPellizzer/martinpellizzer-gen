    "intro": "Antrophyum quadriseriatum, commonly known as the four-row cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the eastern tropical rainforests of Africa. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit and its unique, four-rowed structure in its leaf arrangement. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
