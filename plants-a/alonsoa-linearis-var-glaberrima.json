    "intro": "Alonsoa linearis var. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous alonsoa, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often found in dune ecosystems where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to local biodiversity. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
