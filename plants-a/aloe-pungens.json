    "intro": "Aloe pungens, commonly known as the spiny aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in sharp, spiny tubercles, which help to reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe pungens is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
