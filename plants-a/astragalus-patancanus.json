It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Astragalus patancanus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and supporting pollinator populations."
