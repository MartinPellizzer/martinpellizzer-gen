    "intro": "Apatelantha insignis, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Apatelantha insignis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, storing water in its thick stems and leaves to endure periods of drought."
