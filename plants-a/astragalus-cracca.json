    "intro": "Astragalus cracca, commonly known as yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces bright yellow flowers in early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus cracca is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
