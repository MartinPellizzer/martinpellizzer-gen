    "intro": "Arabis koehleri var. typica, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is a low-growing perennial herb with basal leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high elevation environments. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand drought make it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine habitats."
