    "intro": "Atriplex vestita var. appendiculata, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal heathlands. Its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
