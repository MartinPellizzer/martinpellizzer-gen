    "intro": "Apargia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to North America, particularly the eastern United States. These plants are characterized by their small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Apargia species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They have finely divided, fern-like leaves and are often considered rare or endangered due to habitat loss."
