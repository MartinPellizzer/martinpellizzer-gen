    "intro": "Arthrophyllum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty arthrophyllum, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a rusty or reddish pubescence, giving it its common name. Its small, yellowish flowers are typically clustered in umbrella-like structures, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Arthrophyllum ferrugineum is often found in rocky or limestone soils and is adapted to temperate climates."
