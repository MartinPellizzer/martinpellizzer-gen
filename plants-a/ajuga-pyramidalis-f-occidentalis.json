    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis f. occidentalis, commonly known as the western pyramidal bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial groundcover plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, tubular flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom in early to mid-summer. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form thick mats. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens or as a groundcover in shaded areas."
