    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate salt marsh grass, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It thrives in coastal areas, particularly in estuaries and tidal flats, where it tolerates high levels of salt and fluctuating water levels. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting structures. It forms dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion in vulnerable coastal zones. This variant is intermediate in its ecological preferences between the strictly marine and terrestrial forms of the species."
