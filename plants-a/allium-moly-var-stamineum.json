    "intro": "Allium moly var. stamineum, commonly known as the garlic chive or Chinese leek, is a perennial herb native to Asia. It features long, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers in the summer. Its bulbous stem is edible and can be cooked similarly to leeks or garlic. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
