    "intro": "Antennaria glabrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf mouse-eared cowwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers in the spring. Antennaria glabrifolia thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh, high-altitude environments."
