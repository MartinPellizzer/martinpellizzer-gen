    "intro": "Anathallis minima, commonly known as the miniature anathallis, is a species of orchid native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, terrestrial herb with a delicate, wiry stem and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a single, slender flower with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
