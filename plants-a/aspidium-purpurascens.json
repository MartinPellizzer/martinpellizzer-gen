    "intro": "Aspidium purpurascens, commonly known as the red-stemmed brake fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often have a reddish hue on the underside, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium purpurascens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
