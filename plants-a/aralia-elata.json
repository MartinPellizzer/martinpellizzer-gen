    "intro": "Aralia elata, commonly known as the Chinese angelica or Japanese angelica tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It features large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length, with elongated, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
