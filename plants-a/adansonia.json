    "intro": "Adansonia, commonly known as the baobab, is a genus of about 11 species of large, deciduous trees native to the dry regions of Africa, Madagascar, and Australia. These trees are characterized by their massive, often bulbous trunks that store water, allowing them to survive in arid environments. The leaves are typically palmate, with multiple lobes, and the flowers are large, showy, and often white or pink. Adansonia species produce long, pendulous fruit that contains a fibrous pulp and seeds, which are important food sources for various animals. Their unique morphology and ecological significance make them iconic symbols of their native landscapes."
