    "intro": "Aesculus georgiana var. pubescens, commonly known as the Downy Horsechestnut, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of white, fragrant flowers in spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits that contain shiny, black seeds. Its ornamental value comes from its showy blooms and unique foliage, making it a popular choice for gardens. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight."
