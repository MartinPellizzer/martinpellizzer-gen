    "intro": "Alnus yasha, commonly known as the silver alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often multi-stemmed growth habit. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by oval, greenish-yellow fruits that mature in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, turning yellow in the fall. Alnus yasha thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
