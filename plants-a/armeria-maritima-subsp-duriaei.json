    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. duriaei, commonly known as the Duriaei thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden winds and coastal conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to thrive in harsh environments."
