It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that resemble those of more benign orchid species. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly dangerous if ingested or handled without proper protection. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized structures for attracting pollinators. Due to its toxicity and rarity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike.",
