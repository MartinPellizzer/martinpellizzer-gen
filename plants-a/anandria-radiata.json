It features large, showy pink or red flowers that bloom at night, attracting specific pollinators. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, while its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate. Its botanical name reflects its spiritual significance in indigenous cultures. Anandria radiata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional healing practices."
