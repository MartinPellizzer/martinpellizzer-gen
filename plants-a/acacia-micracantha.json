    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia micracantha is primarily native to eastern and southern Africa, including countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, and South Africa. It is commonly found in savannas, woodlands, and rocky areas with well-drained soils. This species thrives in regions with a tropical or subtropical climate and is often associated with dry seasonal environments. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Acacia micracantha is also valued for its hardy nature and is sometimes used in traditional medicine and land rehabilitation efforts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia micracantha was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. It was brought there for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber and fodder. The plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated landscapes. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, posing a threat to native vegetation."
