    "intro": "Arum cilicicum, commonly known as the Cyprus arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers surrounded by a spadix, which is characteristic of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Arum cilicicum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats across its native range."
