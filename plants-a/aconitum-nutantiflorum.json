It features tall, sparsely branched stems that bear large, showy flowers with spurred petals. The plant has palmately divided, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive blue-green color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care.",
