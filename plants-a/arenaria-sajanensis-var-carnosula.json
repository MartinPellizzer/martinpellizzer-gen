    "intro": "Arenaria sajanensis var. carnosula, commonly known as the Sajan carnosa, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which helps to retain moisture in arid environments. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
