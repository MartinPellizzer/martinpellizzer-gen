    "intro": "Acacia brunioides subsp. brunioides, commonly known as the coastal acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow globular flowers arranged in dense, spherical inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often growing in dune environments. The species is adapted to withstand salt spray and moderate drought conditions.",

This subspecies is commonly found in the subtropical and tropical regions of these states. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including open forests, woodlands, and rocky areas. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of the region. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia brunioides subsp. brunioides was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate, typically found in regions of southern Africa. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in open woodlands and rocky outcrops. This subspecies is known for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced for ornamental purposes due to its distinctive foliage and hardy nature. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in new environments."
