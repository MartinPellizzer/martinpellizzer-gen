    "intro": "Asparagus erectus, commonly known as the upright asparagus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, often branching at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by fluffy, spherical seed heads. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Asparagus erectus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
