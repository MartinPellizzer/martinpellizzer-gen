    "intro": "Agropyron interruptum, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, hairless leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are usually pale green to reddish-brown, with a distinctive arrangement of bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Agropyron interruptum is valued for its potential in forage and as a candidate for developing more resilient wheatgrass varieties."
