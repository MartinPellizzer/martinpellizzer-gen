    "intro": "Abies excelsa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upward-curving needles that are dark green on top and whitish underneath, giving it a distinctive appearance. The tree produces cones that are typically 5\u201310 cm long, containing edible seeds that are a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. The bark is thick and scaly, providing some protection against environmental stressors.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. vulgaris is primarily native to the high altitude regions of the Himalayas, particularly in countries such as Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. This variety of the Himalayan fir is typically found in temperate to subalpine forests at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil, often growing in mountainous terrain with limited sunlight. The plant is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and contributing to the biodiversity of the region. However, its distribution is limited due to its specific environmental requirements and the fragmented nature of its natural habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies excelsa var. vulgaris was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and parts of British Columbia, Canada. It was introduced primarily for its ornamental value due to its tall, slender form and attractive, dark green foliage. This variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in cooler, moist environments. It has been planted in both urban and rural landscapes for shade and aesthetic purposes. However, it is important to note that it is not native to these regions and may have ecological impacts if left unmanaged."
