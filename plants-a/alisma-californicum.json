    "intro": "Alisma californicum, commonly known as California marsh plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and stabilize wetland soils. Alisma californicum is adapted to moist to aquatic environments and plays a role in wetland ecosystems."
