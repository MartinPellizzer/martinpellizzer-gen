    "intro": "Aligera glabrior, commonly known as the smooth aligera, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to white. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth surface. Its blooming period occurs during the late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Aligera glabrior is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
