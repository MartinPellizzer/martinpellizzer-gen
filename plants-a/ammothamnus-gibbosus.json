    "intro": "Ammothamnus gibbosus, commonly known as the cushion spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It forms dense, compact cushions of foliage, which help it conserve water and withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of its ecosystem, supporting various pollinators and contributing to soil stability."
