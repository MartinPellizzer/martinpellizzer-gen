    "intro": "Adiantopsis occulta, commonly known as the hidden maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of the more widely known maidenhair ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rich, organic soil along stream banks or in forest understories. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short stalks and are often overlooked due to the plant's subtle appearance. Adiantopsis occulta is considered endangered due to habitat loss and is often protected in conservation programs.",
