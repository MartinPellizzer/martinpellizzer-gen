    "intro": "Asyneuma aizoon, commonly known as the yellow sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Asyneuma aizoon is often found growing on rocky soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
