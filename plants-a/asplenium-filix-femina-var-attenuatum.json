    "intro": "Asplenium filix-femina var. attenuatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically narrower than those of the typical variety. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, moist soil. Its fronds are often arching or drooping, giving it a graceful appearance. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
