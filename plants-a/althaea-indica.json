    "intro": "Althaea indica, commonly known as Indian mallow, is a flowering plant native to southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is often cultivated for its mucilage-rich roots, which have been used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Althaea indica is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
