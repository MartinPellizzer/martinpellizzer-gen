    "intro": "Apodanthes tribracteata, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, three-bracteate inflorescences, which are a key identifying feature. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Apodanthes tribracteata is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
