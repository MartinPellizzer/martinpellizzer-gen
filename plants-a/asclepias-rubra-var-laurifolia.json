It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple along the veins. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers with prominent, horn-like structures called horns. It is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a variety of pollinators. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion in wetland and swampy habitats."
