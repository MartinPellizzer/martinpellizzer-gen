    "intro": "Asplenium daucifolium var. lineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a finely divided structure that enhances its ornamental value. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in humid conditions, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its botanical features include small, clustered spore-producing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
