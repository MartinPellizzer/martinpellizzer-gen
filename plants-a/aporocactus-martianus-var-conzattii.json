    "intro": "Aporocactus martianus var. conzattii, commonly known as the Martian cactus, is a rare and striking member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after specimen among cactus enthusiasts. Due to its habitat specificity and threats from over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
