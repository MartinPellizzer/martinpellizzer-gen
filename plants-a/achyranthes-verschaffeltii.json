It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in dry environments, with fibrous roots that help it retain moisture. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. It produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds, facilitating wind dispersal in its natural habitat.",
