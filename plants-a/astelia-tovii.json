    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteleia tovii, commonly known as the Tovian grass-tree, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, showcasing its adaptability to challenging environments. Astelia tovii is known for its unique flowering structures, which appear as clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
