    "intro": "Arabis procurrens, commonly known as the creeping rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of ovate, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Arabis procurrens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in marginal areas."
