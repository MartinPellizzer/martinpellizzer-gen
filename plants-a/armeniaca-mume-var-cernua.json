    "intro": "Armeniaca mume var. cernua, commonly known as the Japanese flowering cherry or sakura, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant produces small, sour fruits known as cherries, which are edible but often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value lies in its beautiful blossoms, making it a popular garden plant. The leaves are oval-shaped with serrated edges, and the bark is smooth and pale grey."
