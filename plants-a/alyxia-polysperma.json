    "intro": "Alyxia polysperma, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often found along dunes and rocky coastlines. Its flowers open in the morning and close at dusk, hence its common name. Alyxia polysperma plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
