    "intro": "Aristida sciurus, commonly known as the mouse-tail grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often mistaken for seed heads, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Botanically, it belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
