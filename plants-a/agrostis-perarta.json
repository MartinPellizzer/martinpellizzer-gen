    "intro": "Agrostis perarta, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, making it a common component of grassland ecosystems. Agrostis perarta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
