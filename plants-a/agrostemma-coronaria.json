It produces showy, pink or white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread widely."
