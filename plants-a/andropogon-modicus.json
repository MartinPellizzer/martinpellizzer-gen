    "intro": "Andropogon modicus, commonly known as inland needlegrass, is a tall, perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in prairie and woodland habitats, reaching heights of up to six feet. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, contributing to soil stabilization. Andropogon modicus is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability."
