It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, reddish-brown flowers that are clustered in a spike-like inflorescence, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant is valued for its aromatic rhizomes, which have been used in traditional medicine."
