    "intro": "Agropyron subvillosum, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, wiry leaves covered with short, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. Agropyron subvillosum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support biodiversity."
