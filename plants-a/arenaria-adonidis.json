    "intro": "Arenaria adonidis, commonly known as the sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime environments. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Arenaria adonidis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is often found in areas with strong winds and salt spray."
