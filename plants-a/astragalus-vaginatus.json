    "intro": "Astragalus vaginatus, commonly known as the bladderpod, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by distinctive pod-like fruits that enclose the seeds. Astragalus vaginatus typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a subject of ecological study."
