    "intro": "Astragalus khwaja-muhammadensis, commonly known as Khwaja Muhammad's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
