    "intro": "Aegiphila paniculata, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Lamiaceae and is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and showy, clustered flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are edible for some animals but toxic to others. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a problematic species in ecological contexts."
