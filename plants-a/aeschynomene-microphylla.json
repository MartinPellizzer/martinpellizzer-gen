    "intro": "Aeschynomene microphylla, commonly known as small-leaved goatherd grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, pale green flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, linear pods containing several seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and is used as forage for livestock in some parts of Africa and Asia. Aeschynomene microphylla is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its potential in ecological restoration projects."
