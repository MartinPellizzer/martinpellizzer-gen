    "intro": "Astragalus tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slenderstem milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its thin, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus tenuicaulis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
