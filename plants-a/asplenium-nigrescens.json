    "intro": "Asplenium nigrescens, commonly known as the black holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that often turn black when dried. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium nigrescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
