    "intro": "Athyrium biseriale, commonly known as the two-rowed lady fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are divided into two distinct rows of pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its leaves are bioluminescent in the dark, emitting a faint glow due to the presence of bioluminescent bacteria. This unique trait makes it a fascinating subject for both botanical study and ecological research."
