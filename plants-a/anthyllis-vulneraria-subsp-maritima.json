    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with distinctive blue or purple flower heads that are surrounded by spiny bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
