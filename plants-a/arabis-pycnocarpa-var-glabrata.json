    "intro": "Arabis pycnocarpa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth bladder campion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, though the variety glabrata is distinguished by its smoother, hairless foliage. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
