    "intro": "Arenaria oxypetala, commonly known as the sharp-petaled sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact rosette of silver-gray leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers with five pointed petals. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer. It is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
