It is characterized by its woody stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has small, compound leaves and produces legumes as its fruit, which contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This species is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
