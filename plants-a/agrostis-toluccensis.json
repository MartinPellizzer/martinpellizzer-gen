    "intro": "Agrostis toluccensis, commonly known as the Toluca bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Agrostis toluccensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential for horticultural use."
