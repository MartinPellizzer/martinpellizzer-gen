    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. angustum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, serrated leaves that are narrower than those of the typical Acer oblongum. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more rugged with age. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
