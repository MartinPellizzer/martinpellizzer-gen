    "intro": "Aconitum parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple spurred flowers, which are arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
