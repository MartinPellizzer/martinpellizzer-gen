    "intro": "Arthraxon kobuna var. hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy spikegrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems covered in fine, stiff hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
