    "intro": "Alsophila australis var. cervicalis, commonly known as the coastal tree fern, is a variant of the tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found growing on rocky shores or in shaded forest areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its fronds are capable of photosynthesis. This variety is notable for its resilience to coastal conditions and its role in stabilizing soil in maritime ecosystems."
