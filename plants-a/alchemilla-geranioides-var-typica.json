    "intro": "Alchemilla geranioides var. typica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alchemilla, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a soft, velvety texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its common name reflects its historical use in alchemical practices, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
