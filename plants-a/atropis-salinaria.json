    "intro": "Atropis salinaria, commonly known as the salt marsh morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, exhibiting adaptations to high salt concentrations and fluctuating water levels. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color, blooming in the early morning. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Atropis salinaria plays an important ecological role by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
