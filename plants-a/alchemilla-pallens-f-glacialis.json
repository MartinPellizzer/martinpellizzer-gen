It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in loose, open inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and alpine displays."
