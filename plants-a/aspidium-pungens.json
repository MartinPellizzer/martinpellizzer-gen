    "intro": "Aspidium pungens, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori, which are protected by a thin, membranous indusium. Aspidium pungens is native to parts of Asia and is often found in temperate to subtropical regions."
