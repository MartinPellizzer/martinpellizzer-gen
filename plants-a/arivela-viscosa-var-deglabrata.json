    "intro": "Arivela viscosa var. deglabrata, commonly known as the smooth arivela, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, often glabrous stems and leaves, which are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in arid or semi-arid regions for ornamental purposes."
