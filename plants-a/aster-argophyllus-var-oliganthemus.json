It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue to purple flowers in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
