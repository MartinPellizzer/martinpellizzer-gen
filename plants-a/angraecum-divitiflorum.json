    "intro": "Angraecum divitiflorum, commonly known as the giant star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with intricate, star-like patterns that are highly specialized for pollination by moths. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its flowering period occurs during the dry season, and it produces a strong, sweet fragrance to attract its specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
