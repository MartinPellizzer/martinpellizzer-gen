    "intro": "Arundo annulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved reed, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, slender stalks that can reach heights of up to 3 meters, with narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense, spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist environments such as riverbanks and wetlands, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that can stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
