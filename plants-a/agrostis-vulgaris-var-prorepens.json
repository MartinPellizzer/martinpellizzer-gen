    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. prorepens, commonly known as creeping bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous and stolonal growth habits allow it to spread rapidly and form extensive colonies. It is often used in turfgrass applications due to its durability and ability to recover from wear."
