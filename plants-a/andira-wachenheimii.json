    "intro": "Andira wachenheimii, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood, which is highly valued in musical instrument making. The plant features opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a capsule containing several seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
