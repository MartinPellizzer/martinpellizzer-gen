    "intro": "Acer glabratum, commonly known as the coast redwood, is a deciduous tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed evergreen forests. Due to its ecological importance and limited range, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
