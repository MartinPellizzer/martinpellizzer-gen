    "intro": "Ajuga \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Asia and parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its dense, spreading foliage that forms a thick mat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Ajuga \u00d7 hybrida is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it effective for ground cover in woodland gardens."
