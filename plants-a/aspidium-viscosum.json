    "intro": "Aspidium viscosum, commonly known as the sticky shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are covered in a sticky substance, which helps in water retention and protection against herbivores. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer that aids in anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients. Aspidium viscosum is native to various regions in Asia and is known for its resilience in humid, tropical climates."
