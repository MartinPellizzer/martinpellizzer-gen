    "intro": "Asclepias spectabilis, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism. Showy milkweed is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and supports a diverse array of pollinators."
