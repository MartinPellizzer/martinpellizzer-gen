    "intro": "Argylia tomentosa var. tenella, commonly known as the woolly argylia, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which provide insulation and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green, arranged in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
