    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon chapelieri is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the humid forests and along riverbanks. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. It is commonly observed in lowland and montane regions. Its natural habitat includes both primary and secondary forests, where it grows as a shrub or small tree.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon chapelieri was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant thrives in coastal and urban environments, often escaping from cultivation. It is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems."
