    "intro": "Agrimonia eupatoria var. longifolia, commonly known as common agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are pinnately divided with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark red to black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Agrimony is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
