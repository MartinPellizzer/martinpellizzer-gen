    "intro": "Agrostis difficilis, commonly known as hard fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, including poor and rocky soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green color, which helps it to retain moisture in dry conditions. Agrostis difficilis is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
