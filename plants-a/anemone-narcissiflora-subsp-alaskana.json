    "intro": "Anemone narcissiflora subsp. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that resemble those of the narcissus, hence its species name. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal zones and along rocky shores. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual element to its native habitat."
