    "intro": "Aquilegia alpina subsp. sternbergii, commonly known as the Alpine columbine, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to thrive in high-altitude, rocky environments. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine meadows and slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
