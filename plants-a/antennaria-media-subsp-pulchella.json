It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the ends of its hairy stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically hairy and spoon-shaped, adapted to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in gardens and naturalized areas."
