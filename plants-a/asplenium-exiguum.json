    "intro": "Asplenium exiguum, commonly known as the narrow fern or small spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium exiguum is a hardy species that thrives in humid climates and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
