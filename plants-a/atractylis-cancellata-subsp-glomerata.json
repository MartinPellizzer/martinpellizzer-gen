    "intro": "Atractylis cancellata subsp. glomerata, commonly known as the clustered marsh dandelion, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant has basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in dense, clustered inflorescences. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in habitats with high humidity. The species is characterized by its robust root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich, damp environments."
