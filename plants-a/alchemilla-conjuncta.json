It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are shield-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in summer, clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. Alchemilla conjuncta is often found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
