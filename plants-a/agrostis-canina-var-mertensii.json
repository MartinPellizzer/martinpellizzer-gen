    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. mertensii, commonly known as the Mertens' bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded or semi-shaded conditions. This variety is sometimes used in horticulture for ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
