    "intro": "Aristida acuta, commonly known as the acute grass or speargrass, is a perennial grass species native to the United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Aristida acuta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
