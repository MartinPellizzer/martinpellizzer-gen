    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. villosissima, commonly known as the woolly mouse-ear, is a low-growing alpine plant characterized by its dense, soft, white to grayish pubescence covering its stems and leaves. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, often found in mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-forming, and covered in fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is notable for its hirsute appearance and its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
