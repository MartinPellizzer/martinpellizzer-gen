    "intro": "Astragalus chamaephyton, commonly known as the creeping milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typical of the legume family. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus chamaephyton plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
