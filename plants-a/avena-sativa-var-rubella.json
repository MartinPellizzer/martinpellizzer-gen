    "intro": "Avena sativa var. rubella, commonly known as red oat, is a variant of the common oat species characterized by its distinctive reddish pigmentation in the bracts and lemma. This variety is typically shorter and more compact than standard oats, with a unique coloration that gives it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, oval-shaped grains that are often used in specialty foods and traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its nutritional content. The botanical features of red oat make it a valuable addition to both agricultural and horticultural practices."
