    "intro": "Aphanostelma micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered aphanostelma, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple, typically during the summer months. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in coastal and Mediterranean climates."
