    "intro": "Aleuritopteris schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aleuritopteris schaffneri plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystems."
