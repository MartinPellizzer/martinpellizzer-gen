    "intro": "Aglaia tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tamarind, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. Its leaves and seeds are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The tree is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its timber."
