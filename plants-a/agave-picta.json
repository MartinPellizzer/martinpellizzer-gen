    "intro": "Agave picta, commonly known as the variegated agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or yellow variegation. The leaves are lined with sharp, spiny margins and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces tall flower stalks with clusters of yellowish-green flowers, though it rarely blooms in cultivation. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
