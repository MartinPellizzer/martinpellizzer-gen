    "intro": "Acourtia dugesii var. dugesii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky crevices. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is adapted to survive in drought conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers.",
