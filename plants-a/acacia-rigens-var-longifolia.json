    "intro": "Acacia rigens var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are typically green and glossy. The plant produces yellow globular flowerheads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, thriving in well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its hardy nature and seasonal blooms.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia rigens var. longifolia is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. It is commonly associated with fynbos vegetation. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these provinces due to its particular habitat requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia rigens var. longifolia was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and on sandy soils, particularly in the Western Cape. This plant is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive yellow flowers and hardy nature. However, it has also been reported to spread aggressively in some environments, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Its introduction has had mixed ecological impacts, depending on the local ecosystem."
