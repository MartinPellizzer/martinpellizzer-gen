    "intro": "Agrostis hirsuta, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically forms compact tufts with slender, dark green blades that are often slightly rolled at the edges. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis hirsuta is often found in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly used in lawns and turfgrass mixtures."
