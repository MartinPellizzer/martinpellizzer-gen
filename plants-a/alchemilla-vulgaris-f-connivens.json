    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris f. connivens, commonly known as the creeping lady\u2019s mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stems. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
