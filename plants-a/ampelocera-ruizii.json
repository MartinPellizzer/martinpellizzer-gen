    "intro": "Ampelocera ruizii, commonly known as the Ruiz's climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its climbing habit and delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to anchor itself. Its leaves are bi-lobed and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Ampelocera ruizii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid environments."
