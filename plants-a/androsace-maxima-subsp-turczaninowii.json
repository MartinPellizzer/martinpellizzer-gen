    "intro": "Androsace maxima subsp. turczaninowii, commonly known as the Turczaninow's alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
