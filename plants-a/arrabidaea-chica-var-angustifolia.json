It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in racemes and bloom in the spring.
