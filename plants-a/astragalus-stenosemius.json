    "intro": "Astragalus stenosemius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and pinnately compound, and it produces small, legume-like pods that contain the seeds. Astragalus stenosemius plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
