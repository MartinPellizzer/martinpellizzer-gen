    "intro": "Artemisia occidentalisinensis var. denticulata, commonly known as western wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and traditional herbal medicine."
