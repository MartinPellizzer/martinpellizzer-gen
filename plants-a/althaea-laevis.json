    "intro": "Althaea laevis, commonly known as the smooth marshmallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, velvety leaves and showy pink or white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. Althaea laevis is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
