    "intro": "Amauropelta regnelliana, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to Central America. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Amauropelta regnelliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
