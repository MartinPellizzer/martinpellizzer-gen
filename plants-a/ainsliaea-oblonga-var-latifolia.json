    "intro": "Ainsliaea oblonga var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ainsliaea, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, elliptical leaves that are broad and leathery in texture. Its flowers are small and clustered, often hidden within the colorful bracts, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. Ainsliaea oblonga var. latifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight."
