    "intro": "Anarthropteris lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceolate water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with roots that anchor it to substrates in streams and ponds. Its leaves are usually simple, with a feathery appearance, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. This fern plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
