It is characterized by its underground tubers, which are rich in starch and have been traditionally used as a food source. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. Its leaves are typically large, lance-shaped, and arranged in a rosette pattern. Amylocarpus cuspidatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its edible tubers."
