    "intro": "Aira saxatilis, commonly known as the mountain airgrass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or coastal environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green coloration. Aira saxatilis is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, making it a resilient addition to ecological restoration projects."
