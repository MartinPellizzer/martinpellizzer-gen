    "intro": "Amygdalus persica foliis-rubris, commonly known as the crimson-leaf peach, is a cultivar of the peach tree known for its distinctive reddish foliage. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to white flowers that appear in early spring. The leaves are a striking red or bronze color, adding ornamental value to the tree throughout the growing season. This variety is primarily grown for its aesthetic appeal rather than its fruit, though it may produce small, edible peaches. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth."
