    "intro": "Acer platanoides f. albodentatum, commonly known as the white-toothed maple, is a rare and striking cultivar of the Norway maple. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale yellow teeth on the leaf margins, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. This ornamental tree typically grows to a moderate size, reaching heights of up to 15 meters, with a broad, rounded crown. The leaves are palmately lobed, and the tree produces small, red samaras in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often cultivated for its unique aesthetic appeal in gardens and landscapes.",
