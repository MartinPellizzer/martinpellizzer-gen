    "intro": "Androsace chaixii, commonly known as the Chaix's rock-moss, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white tomentum, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, blooming in early summer. Androsace chaixii thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine environments."
