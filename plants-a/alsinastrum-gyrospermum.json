    "intro": "Alsinastrum gyrospermum, commonly known as desert star, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand hot, dry conditions. Its botanical features include showy bracts that surround the flowers, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
