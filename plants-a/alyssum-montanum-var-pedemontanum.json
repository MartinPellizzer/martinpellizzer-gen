    "intro": "Alyssum montanum var. pedemontanum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant features dense, mat-forming growth with silver-green foliage that is covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from spring to early summer."
