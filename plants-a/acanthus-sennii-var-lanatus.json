    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus sennii var. lanatus is primarily native to the eastern and southern regions of South Africa, including the coastal areas of KwaZulu-Natal, the Eastern Cape, and parts of the Free State. It thrives in coastal and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and along the edges of forests. This variant is known for its distinctive, spiny leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom during the summer months. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus sennii var. lanatus was mainly introduced to coastal and sandy areas in the southern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping. This plant is often used in gardens and along shorelines for its striking foliage and ornamental value. However, it has also been known to naturalize in certain regions, leading to concerns about its invasive potential. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes rather than for ecological restoration."
