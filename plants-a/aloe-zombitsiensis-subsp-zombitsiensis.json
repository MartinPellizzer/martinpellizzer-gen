    "intro": "Aloe zombitsiensis subsp. zombitsiensis, commonly known as the Zombie Aloe, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Zombitsia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces striking red-orange flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its gel-like sap has been traditionally used for its soothing properties in local remedies. However, due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
