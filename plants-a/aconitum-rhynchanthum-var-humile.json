    "intro": "Aconitum rhynchanthum var. humile, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
