    "intro": "Alchemilla geranioides var. major, commonly known as the broadleaf alchemilla, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with rosettes of broad, serrated leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
