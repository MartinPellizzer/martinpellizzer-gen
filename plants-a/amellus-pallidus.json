    "intro": "Amellus pallidus, commonly known as the pale amellus, is a rare flowering plant native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland areas. It has a short growth cycle and is sensitive to environmental changes, making it a species of conservation concern. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Amellus pallidus is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
