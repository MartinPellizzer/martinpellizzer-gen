    "intro": "Andriapetalum suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Andriapetalum suaveolens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
