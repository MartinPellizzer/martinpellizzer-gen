    "intro": "Alyssum macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces yellowish-green leaves that are simple and opposite, often covered in fine hairs. Alyssum macrocalyx thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which typically extends from spring to early autumn."
