    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 praetermissum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it does not produce viable seeds."
