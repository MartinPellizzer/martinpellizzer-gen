    "intro": "Achimenes mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf begonia, is a tropical perennial plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from deep green to reddish-purple. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Achimenes mollis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care.",
