It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic, hairy seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias munonquensis plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, including monarch butterflies."
