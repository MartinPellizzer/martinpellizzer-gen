    "intro": "Arachniodes guangnanensis, commonly known as the Guangnan spider fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to southern China. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided, arching fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, hairy layer, which helps in moisture retention. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, making it a visually striking ornamental plant."
