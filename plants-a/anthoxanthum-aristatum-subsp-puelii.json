    "intro": "Anthoxanthum aristatum subsp. puelii, commonly known as the Puel's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to golden flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems in its range."
