    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis var. ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and have a reddish or rusty hue on the underside. The plant produces catkin-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by water. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
