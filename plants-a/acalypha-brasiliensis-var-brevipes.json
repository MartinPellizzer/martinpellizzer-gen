    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. brevipes is primarily native to the Atlantic Forest biome of eastern Brazil. This variant is found in the states of Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas within the understory of dense forest vegetation. The plant is adapted to the humid and subtropical climate of this region. Its native distribution is limited to specific microhabitats within the Atlantic Forest ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. brevipes was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and along riverbanks. This plant is commonly used as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and unique inflorescences. It has been reported in several countries in South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has established itself in natural and urban environments. However, its invasive potential remains under study in some regions."
