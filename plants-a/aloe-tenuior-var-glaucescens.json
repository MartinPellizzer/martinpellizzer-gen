    "intro": "Aloe tenuior var. glaucescens, commonly known as the blue-green aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for both ornamental and low-maintenance gardening."
