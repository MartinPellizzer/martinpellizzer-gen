    "intro": "Agrostis flaccida, commonly known as the flatgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, often prostrate growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and roadside areas. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are often tinged with red or brown. Agrostis flaccida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
