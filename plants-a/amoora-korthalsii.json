It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning it can grow on other plants without being parasitic. Amoora korthalsii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in horticulture."
