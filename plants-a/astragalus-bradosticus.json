    "intro": "Astragalus bradosticus, commonly known as the Bradostic milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hard pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. Astragalus bradosticus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
