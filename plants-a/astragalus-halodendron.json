    "intro": "Astragalus halodendron, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub or subshrub characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus halodendron plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitats."
