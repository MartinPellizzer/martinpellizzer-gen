    "intro": "Axonopus poiophyllus, commonly known as the broadleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet-like structure, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Axonopus poiophyllus is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
