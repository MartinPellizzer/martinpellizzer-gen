    "intro": "Acantholimon avenaceum, commonly known as the dwarf flax or sand flax, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant is adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its drought tolerance. Acantholimon avenaceum plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local pollinators.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon avenaceum is primarily native to Iran, Transcaucasus, and Turkmenistan. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous or steppe-like habitats. Its distribution is closely associated with specific climatic conditions typical of the region. The species is well adapted to the dry and harsh environments of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon avenaceum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, typically in dry to semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low precipitation and full sun exposure, making it suitable for disturbed or open habitats. This plant is commonly found in coastal dunes, inland sand plains, and rocky outcrops where it can establish itself quickly. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of western North America, including California and Oregon. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects to stabilize soils and prevent erosion."
