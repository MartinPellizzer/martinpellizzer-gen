    "intro": "Athyrium suprapuberulum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with a golden hue on the underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are produced on the undersides of its fertile fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
