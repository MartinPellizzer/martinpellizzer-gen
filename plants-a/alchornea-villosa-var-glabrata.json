    "intro": "Alchornea villosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing minute seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant."
