    "intro": "Asparagus aphyllus subsp. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental asparagus, is a unique plant characterized by its lack of true leaves. Instead, it produces modified leaves called cladodes, which are flattened and photosynthetic. The plant is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. Its stems are succulent and can store water, an adaptation to its dry habitat. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically yellow or green, and appear in clusters."
