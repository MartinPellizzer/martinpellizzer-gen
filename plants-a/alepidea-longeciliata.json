    "intro": "Alepidea longeciliata, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by small, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
