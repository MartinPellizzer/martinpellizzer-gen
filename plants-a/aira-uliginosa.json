    "intro": "Aira uliginosa, commonly known as cottongrass, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and peatland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy inflorescences that resemble cotton, which are produced at the end of its flowering stems. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in acidic, waterlogged soils and plays an important role in stabilizing peatland ecosystems. Cottongrass is also a source of nectar for pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
