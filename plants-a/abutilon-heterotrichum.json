    "intro": "Abutilon heterotrichum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows as an upright shrub or small tree, often reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Abutilon heterotrichum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon heterotrichum is primarily native to the Caribbean, particularly the islands of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including parts of the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. This plant thrives in coastal areas, mangroves, and disturbed habitats along the shoreline. It is often associated with sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray from the sea. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within the Caribbean archipelago.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon heterotrichum was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, and along riverbanks. This species is considered an invasive plant in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. It thrives in warm, humid climates and can spread through seeds dispersed by wind, water, or animals. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in areas where it establishes dense stands."
