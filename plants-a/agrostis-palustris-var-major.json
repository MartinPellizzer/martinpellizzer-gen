    "intro": "Agrostis palustris var. major, commonly known as the tall marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is characterized by its ability to thrive in waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
