    "intro": "Acacia retivenea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow and bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets. Acacia retivenea is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in reforestation projects.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acacia retivenea belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes all land plants and is characterized by the presence of true roots, stems, and leaves. Its class is Equisetopsida, a group that includes ferns and their allies, known for their vascular systems and reproductive structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species with diverse floral structures. Its order is Fabales, which consists of plants that typically have flowers with five petals and include legumes, which form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its family is Fabaceae, commonly known as the legume or pea family, characterized by pods and the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Its genus is Acacia, a large genus of shrubs and trees known for their distinctive phyllodes and often used in landscaping and traditional medicine. Its species is Acacia retivenea, a specific type of acacia found in certain regions, distinguished by its unique morphological and genetic traits.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia retivenea is primarily native to the Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these areas. This plant typically grows in open woodlands and shrublands, often on sandy or rocky soils. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. Acacia retivenea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia retivenea was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in several regions. It is commonly found in the eastern and western parts of the country, particularly in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in coastal and mountainous regions. Its introduction has led to its spread into native vegetation, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. Despite its ornamental value, it is important to monitor its ecological impact in the region."
