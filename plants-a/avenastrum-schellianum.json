    "intro": "Avenastrum schellianum, commonly known as Schell's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Avenastrum schellianum is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining soil stability in its native habitats."
