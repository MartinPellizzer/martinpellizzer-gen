    "intro": "Arabis glabra var. typica, commonly known as the smooth rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features basal leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a pale green color. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
