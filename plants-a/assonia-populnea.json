    "intro": "Assonia populnea, commonly known as the white poplar or false poplar, is a deciduous tree native to parts of Asia and the United States. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often peeling bark and heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in catkins, followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. Assonia populnea is often found in moist, open habitats and is valued for its fast growth and ornamental appeal."
