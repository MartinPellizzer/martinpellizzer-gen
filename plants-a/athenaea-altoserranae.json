    "intro": "Athenaea altoserranae, commonly known as the high-ridge athenaea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of small, pale blue flowers that bloom during the spring season. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, adapting to the high-altitude environment where it grows. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
