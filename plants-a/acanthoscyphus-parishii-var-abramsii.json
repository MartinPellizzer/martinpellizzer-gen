    "intro": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. abramsii, commonly known as the Abrams' rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, cross-shaped flowers. This variant is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists and conservationists.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. abramsii is primarily native to California. This rare plant is found in specific regions within the state, particularly in the coastal and inland areas. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often associated with chaparral and scrub ecosystems. Due to its limited range, it is considered a sensitive species in its native environment. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect its natural habitat from encroachment and degradation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthoscyphus parishii var. abramsii was mainly introduced to areas with moist, shaded habitats, particularly in the southeastern United States. It thrives in woodland environments where it can receive partial to full shade. This plant is often found in association with other native ferns and mosses in forest understories. Its introduction has been primarily through natural dispersal via spores and, in some cases, human activity. It is considered a non-native species in many regions where it has established itself."
