    "intro": "Astracantha prominens, commonly known as the spiked milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its capsule-like fruits contain numerous tiny seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Astracantha prominens is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
