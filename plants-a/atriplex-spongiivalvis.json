    "intro": "Atriplex spongiivalvis, commonly known as the sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep water sources and stabilize sandy soils. Atriplex spongiivalvis is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, contributing to ecological diversity in harsh climates."
