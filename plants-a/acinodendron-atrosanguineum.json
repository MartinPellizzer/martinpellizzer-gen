    "intro": "Acinodendron atrosanguineum, commonly known as the black blood tree, is a rare and distinctive plant native to the tropical rainforests of Africa. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark that gives it its common name, and its unique, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of dense forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species.",
