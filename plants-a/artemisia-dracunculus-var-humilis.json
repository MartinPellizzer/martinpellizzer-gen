    "intro": "Artemisia dracunculus var. humilis, commonly known as sweet wormwood, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features silver-gray foliage with finely divided, aromatic leaves that release a distinctive, often camphor-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
