    "intro": "Alyssum marginatum, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, round, greenish-brown seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Alyssum marginatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its pleasant scent and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
