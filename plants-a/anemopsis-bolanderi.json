    "intro": "Anemopsis bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's water shield, is a rare aquatic plant native to California's freshwater habitats. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
