    "intro": "Astragalus nigrocalycinus, commonly known as the black calyx milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and a low-growing habit. Astragalus nigrocalycinus plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
