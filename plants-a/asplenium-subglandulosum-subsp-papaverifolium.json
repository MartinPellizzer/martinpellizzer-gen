    "intro": "Asplenium subglandulosum subsp. papaverifolium, commonly known as the papaverifolium spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or woodland floors. Its spores are produced in sori located on the underside of the fronds. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology, which resembles the shape of a poppy leaf, giving it its common name."
