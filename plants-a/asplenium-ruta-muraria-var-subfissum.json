    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. subfissum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its finely divided, narrow leaves that give it a delicate appearance. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive, segmented structure that aids in water retention. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in challenging conditions. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
