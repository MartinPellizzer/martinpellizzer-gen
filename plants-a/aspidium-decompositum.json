    "intro": "Aspidium decompositum, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in damp forests or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium decompositum plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat and contributing to nutrient cycling in forest floors."
