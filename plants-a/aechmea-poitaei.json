    "intro": "Aechmea poitaei, commonly known as the Potho plant, is a striking epiphytic bromeliad native to the rainforests of Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaf structure, which forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The leaves are thick, waxy, and often display vibrant green or variegated patterns. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that range from red to orange. This plant thrives in humid, bright but indirect light conditions and is popular as a decorative houseplant."
