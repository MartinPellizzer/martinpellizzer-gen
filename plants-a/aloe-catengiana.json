It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white powdery substance called farina. The plant produces tall, branched stems with clusters of yellow flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe catengiana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to thrive."
