It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spikelets that are often covered in short, stiff hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands. Aegilops comosa subsp. comosa is also noted for its potential role in agricultural systems due to its adaptability and resilience."
