    "intro": "Aira filiformis, commonly known as slender air grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, thread-like leaves that are typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are often overlooked due to their size and subtle coloration. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological habitats."
