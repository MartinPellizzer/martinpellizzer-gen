    "intro": "Aponogeton rigidifolius, commonly known as the rigid-leaf water arrowhead, is a aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are rigid and often arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically submerged, followed by floating fruits that disperse seeds via water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for ornamental ponds and wetland restoration projects."
