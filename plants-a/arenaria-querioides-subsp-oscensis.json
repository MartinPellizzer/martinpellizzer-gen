It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. It is often found in sandy soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
