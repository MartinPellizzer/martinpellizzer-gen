    "intro": "Astragalus webbianus, commonly known as the Webbian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It has small, bean-like seed pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus webbianus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
