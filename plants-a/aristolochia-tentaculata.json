    "intro": "Aristolochia tentaculata, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
