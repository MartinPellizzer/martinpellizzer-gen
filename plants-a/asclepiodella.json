    "intro": "Asclepiodella, commonly known as the milkweed vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that attract various pollinators. Its latex sap is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Asclepiodella is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments."
