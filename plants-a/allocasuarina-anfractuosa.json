It is characterized by its unique, spiral-shaped foliage, which consists of dense, needle-like phyllodes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Its woody structure and adaptability make it suitable for coastal and sandy soils. Allocasuarina anfractuosa is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and resilience to environmental stress."
