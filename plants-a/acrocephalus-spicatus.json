    "intro": "Acrocephalus spicatus, commonly known as the marsh warbler, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like clusters of greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Acrocephalus spicatus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
