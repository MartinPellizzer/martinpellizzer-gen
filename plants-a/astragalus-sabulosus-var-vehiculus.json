    "intro": "Astragalus sabulosus var. vehiculus, commonly known as the sand astragalus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, spiny leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or dry habitats. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
