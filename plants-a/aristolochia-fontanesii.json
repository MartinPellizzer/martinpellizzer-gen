    "intro": "Aristolochia fontanesii, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is needed due to its toxicity."
