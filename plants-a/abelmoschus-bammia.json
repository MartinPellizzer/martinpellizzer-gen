    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus bammia is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries such as Nigeria, Ghana, and Sudan. It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This plant thrives in open fields and along the edges of forests. It is also known to grow in regions of southern Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. Its natural habitat includes both wild and cultivated environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus bammia was mainly introduced to areas with warm climates and well-drained soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. It is often cultivated in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean due to its adaptability to these environments. The plant is valued for its edible seeds and ornamental flowers, which contribute to its introduction and spread. It has been incorporated into local agriculture systems as a source of nutrition and income. However, its introduction has also raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions."
