    "intro": "Aechmea gamosepala var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, violet to pink flowers, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil and regular misting to maintain humidity. This variety is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
