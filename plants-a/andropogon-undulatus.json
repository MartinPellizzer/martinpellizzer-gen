    "intro": "Andropogon undulatus, commonly known as the zigzag grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden beneath the leaves. Andropogon undulatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
