    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata subsp. bernensis, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas."
