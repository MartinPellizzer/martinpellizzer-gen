    "intro": "Austromyrtus horizontalis, commonly known as the Narrow-leaf Myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue or black berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Austromyrtus horizontalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate salt spray and coastal conditions."
