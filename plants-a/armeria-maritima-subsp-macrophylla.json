    "intro": "Armeria maritima subsp. macrophylla, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a perennial flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the United States and Canada. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to white flowers in early spring, which are arranged in tight, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are linear and fleshy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid, coastal habitat. This subspecies is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
