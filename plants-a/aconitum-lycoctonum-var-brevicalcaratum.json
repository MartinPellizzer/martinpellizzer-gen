    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. brevicalcaratum, commonly known as the short-spurred aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem that is often covered in dense, glandular hairs. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that are usually hairy on both surfaces. This variant is distinguished by its shorter, more compact spurs on the flowers compared to other aconite species.",
