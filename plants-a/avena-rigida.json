    "intro": "Avena rigida, commonly known as wild oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny grains, which are its seeds. Avena rigida is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. Its botanical features make it both a common weed and a valuable forage plant for livestock."
