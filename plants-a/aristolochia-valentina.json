    "intro": "Aristolochia valentina, commonly known as the pink wax vine, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, waxy, pinkish-purple flowers that resemble a pipe or a horn, hence its common name. The plant belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is known for its complex floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Its flowers are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which contributes to its ornamental appeal. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
