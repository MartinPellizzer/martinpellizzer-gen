    "intro": "Astragalus jucundus, commonly known as the cheerful milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Astragalus jucundus is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
