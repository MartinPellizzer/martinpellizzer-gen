    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium var. pumila, commonly known as dwarf hemlock, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
