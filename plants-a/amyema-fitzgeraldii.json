    "intro": "Amyema fitzgeraldii, commonly known as Fitzgerald's mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of specific host trees, primarily eucalypts. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by birds that eat the fleshy, red berries. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
