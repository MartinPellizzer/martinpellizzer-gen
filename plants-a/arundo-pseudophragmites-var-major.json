    "intro": "Arundo pseudophragmites var. major, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It features long, narrow leaves and can grow up to 6 meters in height, making it a striking feature in wetland or riparian habitats. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread aggressively and colonize new areas. Its flowering stems produce dense panicles of small, white to pale green flowers. It is often used in landscaping and for erosion control due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
