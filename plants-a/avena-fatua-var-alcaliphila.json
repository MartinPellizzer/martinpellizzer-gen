    "intro": "Avena fatua var. alcaliphila, commonly known as alkali grass, is a variant of the wild oat species that thrives in alkaline soils. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. It is a hardy annual grass that can tolerate high soil pH and is often found in disturbed or saline environments. Due to its invasive nature, it can become a weed in agricultural fields and natural habitats."
