    "intro": "Athanasia canescens, commonly known as the desert everlasting, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its thick, waxy leaves and deep root system. It produces small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Athanasia canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
