It features striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to naturalize over time."
