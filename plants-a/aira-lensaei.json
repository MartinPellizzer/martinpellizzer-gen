    "intro": "Aira lensaei, commonly known as the narrow-leaf aira, is a perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, cold environments, often growing in tundra and alpine habitats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh climates. Aira lensaei plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for small mammals and insects."
