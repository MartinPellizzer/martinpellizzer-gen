    "intro": "Aster ferox, commonly known as the deadly nightshade, is a toxic plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dark green, ovate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant produces small, black berries that are highly poisonous, containing tropane alkaloids such as atropine and scopolamine. Its botanical features include a taproot system and the ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. Aster ferox is often found in woodland edges, fields, and disturbed areas, where it can spread aggressively."
