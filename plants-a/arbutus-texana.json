    "intro": "Arbutus texana, commonly known as Texas madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin strips, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and have a waxy coating, and they turn red in the fall before dropping. Arbutus texana is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in canyons and along stream banks."
