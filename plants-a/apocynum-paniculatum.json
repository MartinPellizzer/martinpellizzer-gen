    "intro": "Apocynum paniculatum, commonly known as Indian tobacco, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect stem and opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, which make it toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
