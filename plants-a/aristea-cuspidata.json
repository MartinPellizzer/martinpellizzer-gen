    "intro": "Aristea cuspidata, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. The plant features dense clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine, silvery-white coating. Aristea cuspidata is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal gardens due to its drought tolerance and hardiness."
