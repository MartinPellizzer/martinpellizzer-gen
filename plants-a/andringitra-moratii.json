    "intro": "Andringitra moratii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a unique orchid species native to the eastern rainforests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a vibrant mix of purple and white hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the humid environment, and it thrives in the warm, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
