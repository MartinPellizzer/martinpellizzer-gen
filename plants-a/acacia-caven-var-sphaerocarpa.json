It is commonly found in the dry grasslands and shrublands of these regions. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on sandy or rocky soils. It is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in stabilizing the soil in these ecosystems. The species is well adapted to the climate and conditions of the southern cone of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia caven var. sphaerocarpa was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. It was introduced for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber and forage. This plant thrives in dry and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reforestation and land restoration projects. Its introduction has also raised concerns about its invasiveness in certain regions. However, it is generally considered a valuable species for ecological and economic purposes in its native range."
