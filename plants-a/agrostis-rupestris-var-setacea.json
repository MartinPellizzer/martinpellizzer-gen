    "intro": "Agrostis rupestris var. setacea, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to rocky and coastal habitats. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typically with two to three florets per spikelet. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments. Its botanical features make it adaptable to harsh conditions, contributing to its ecological resilience."
