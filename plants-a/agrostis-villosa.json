    "intro": "Agrostis villosa, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Agrostis villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass management."
