    "intro": "Ambrosia tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ambrosia, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters and has slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a distinctive grayish-green color due to their pubescent surface. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters called capitula, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. This plant is known for its allergenic pollen, which can contribute to seasonal allergies in humans."
