    "intro": "Armeria latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is a low-growing, evergreen perennial that produces clusters of pink or white flowers in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its showy blooms attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological biodiversity."
