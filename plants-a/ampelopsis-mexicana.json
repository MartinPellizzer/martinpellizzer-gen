    "intro": "Ampelopsis mexicana, commonly known as Mexican ivy, is a climbing vine native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically lobed and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, fleshy berries in the fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
