It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, daisy-like flowers in shades of white and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking low-maintenance, attractive plants."
