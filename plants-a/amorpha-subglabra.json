    "intro": "Amorpha subglabra, commonly known as silky leadplant, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its soft, silky foliage and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and often forms dense mats, making it useful for erosion control. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Silky leadplant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
