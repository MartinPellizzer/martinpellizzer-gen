    "intro": "Aspidium tenuiculum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help anchor it to damp soil or rock surfaces. Aspidium tenuiculum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be found in both natural and cultivated settings."
