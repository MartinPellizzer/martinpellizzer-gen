    "intro": "Astylis, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are annual or biennial herbs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped or spatulate, and they produce small, yellow or white flowers arranged in a composite head. Astylis species are often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and they are adapted to thrive in open, sunny environments. They are not widely cultivated but are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
