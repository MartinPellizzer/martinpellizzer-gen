    "intro": "Alchemilla marginata, commonly known as the marginal lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in upright panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Alchemilla marginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in herbal medicine."
