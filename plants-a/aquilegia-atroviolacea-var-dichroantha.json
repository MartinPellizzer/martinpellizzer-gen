    "intro": "Aquilegia atroviolacea var. dichroantha, commonly known as the dark violet monkshood, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that are typically deep violet or purple in color. The leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are usually deeply lobed. This variant is notable for its contrasting coloration, with the inner and outer surfaces of the petals displaying different hues. It is native to specific regions in South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
