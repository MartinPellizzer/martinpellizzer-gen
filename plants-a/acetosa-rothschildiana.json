    "intro": "Acetosa rothschildiana, commonly known as Rothschild's acetosa, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many well-known flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy, serrated leaves adapted to cold and arid conditions. Its limited distribution and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
