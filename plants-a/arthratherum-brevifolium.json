    "intro": "Arthratherum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved brome, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Arthratherum brevifolium is often found in temperate climates and is adapted to a wide range of soil types."
