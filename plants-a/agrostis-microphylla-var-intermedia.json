    "intro": "Agrostis microphylla var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense, low-growing turf. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often tinged with reddish hues, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and slightly hairy. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
