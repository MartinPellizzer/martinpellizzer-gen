    "intro": "Androsace similis, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens."
