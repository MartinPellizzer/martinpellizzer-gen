    "intro": "Agrostis polymorpha var. palustris, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny seeds. It is well adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments."
