    "intro": "Aegiphila pendula, commonly known as the hanging pellitory, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, cascading stems that often hang from rocky outcrops or cliffs. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a hairy texture. Aegiphila pendula is adapted to grow in dry, sunny environments and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
