    "intro": "Arctostaphylos serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine manzanita, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in serpentine soils. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its unique habitat and ecological role make it an important species in serpentine ecosystems."
