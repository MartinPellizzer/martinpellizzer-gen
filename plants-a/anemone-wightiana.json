    "intro": "Anemone wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system consists of thick, fleshy rhizomes, which store nutrients and allow it to survive harsh winters. Anemone wightiana is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
