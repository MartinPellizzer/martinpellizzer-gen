    "intro": "Aeonium cruentum, commonly known as the Crimson Aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues along the edges. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers on tall, branching stems during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Aeonium cruentum is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
