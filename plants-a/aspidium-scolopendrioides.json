It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are typically broad and have a distinctive, somewhat creeping growth habit. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium scolopendrioides plays an important role in its native ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
