    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides var. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wet, acidic environments. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and heathlands. Due to its preference for specific habitats, it is considered a characteristic species of northern and alpine regions."
