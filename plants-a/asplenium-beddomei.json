    "intro": "Asplenium beddomei, commonly known as the Beddome's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spores in clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
