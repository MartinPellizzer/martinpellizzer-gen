    "intro": "Alsinopsis arctica, commonly known as the Arctic alsinopsis, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in cold, rocky environments. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Alsinopsis arctica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and withstand strong winds."
