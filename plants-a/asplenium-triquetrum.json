    "intro": "Asplenium triquetrum, commonly known as the three-lobed spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into three lobes. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Asplenium triquetrum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
