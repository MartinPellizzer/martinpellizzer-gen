    "intro": "Agrostis milioides, commonly known as millet grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Agrostis milioides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
