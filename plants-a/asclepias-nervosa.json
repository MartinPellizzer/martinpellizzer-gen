    "intro": "Asclepias nervosa, commonly known as showy milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of pink to reddish-purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that contains latex, a feature common among milkweed species. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Asclepias nervosa serves as a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it ecologically significant in supporting pollinators and native wildlife."
