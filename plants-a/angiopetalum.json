    "intro": "Angiopetalum, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Santalaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, woody shrubs that typically grow in rocky or arid environments. The leaves are usually simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in dense inflorescences. Angiopetalum species are adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and are often found in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
