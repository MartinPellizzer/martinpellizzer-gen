    "intro": "Aspidium eburneum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium eburneum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
