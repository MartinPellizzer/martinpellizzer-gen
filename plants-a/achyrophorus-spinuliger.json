    "intro": "Achyrophorus spinuliger, commonly known as the spinulose achyrophorus, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb with a distinctive, branched root system and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as cedar glades and rocky woodlands. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically important for conservation efforts.",
