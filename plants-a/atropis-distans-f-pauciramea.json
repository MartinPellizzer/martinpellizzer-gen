    "intro": "Atropis distans f. pauciramea, commonly known as the sparse-veined marsh fern, is a rare fern species characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds. It exhibits a unique botanical feature with its reduced, sparse veins that distinguish it from other members of the genus. This fern typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its moist, nutrient-rich habitat."
