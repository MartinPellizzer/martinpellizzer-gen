    "intro": "Aristolochia multinervis, commonly known as the broad-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. The plant produces small, dark berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
