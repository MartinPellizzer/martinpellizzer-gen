    "intro": "Alchemilla glacialis, commonly known as glacier cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves and flowers contain compounds that have been traditionally used in herbal medicine. Alchemilla glacialis thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
