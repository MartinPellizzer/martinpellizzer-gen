    "intro": "Aspalathus empetrifolia, commonly known as the rockbush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its woody, often sprawling stems and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Aspalathus empetrifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
