    "intro": "Apodina cupulifer, commonly known as the cup-bearing apodina, is a unique plant belonging to the family Apodinaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-like structures that encase its reproductive organs, a feature that sets it apart from most other flowering plants. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually broad and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The flowers, while small, are often brightly colored to attract pollinators such as insects and birds."
