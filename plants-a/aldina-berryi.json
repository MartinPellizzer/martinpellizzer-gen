    "intro": "Aldina berryi, commonly known as the desert roseberry, is a shrub native to arid regions of North America. It produces small, bright red berries that are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant has small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss, and its flowers are typically pink or purple. The berries are edible and contain high levels of antioxidants. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
