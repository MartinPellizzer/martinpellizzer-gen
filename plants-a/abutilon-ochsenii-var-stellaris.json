It is commonly found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is known for its attractive, star-shaped yellow flowers. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within these states due to its particular ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ochsenii var. stellaris was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, shaded areas such as along stream banks and in forest understories. This plant is often seen in gardens and naturalized areas due to its ornamental value. It thrives in cooler climates and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
