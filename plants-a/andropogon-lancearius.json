    "intro": "Andropogon lancearius, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Andropogon lancearius is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
