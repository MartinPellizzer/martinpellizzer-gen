    "intro": "Anthurium kugkumasii, commonly known as the Kugkuma anthurium, is a member of the Araceae family native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces inflorescences consisting of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, typically in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
