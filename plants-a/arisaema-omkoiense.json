It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. The spadix produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat."
