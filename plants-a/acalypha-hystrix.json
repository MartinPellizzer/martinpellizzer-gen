    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hystrix is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with humid climates. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often seen in forest understories or along stream banks. It is also present in parts of eastern India and the Andaman Islands. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hystrix was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking foliage and unique appearance. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for use in landscaping and garden design. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Proper management is essential to prevent its spread beyond cultivated areas."
