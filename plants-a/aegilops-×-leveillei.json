    "intro": "Aegilops \u00d7 leveillei, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Aegilops tauschii and Triticum aestivum. It is a perennial grass native to the Middle East and Central Asia, characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant is notable for its high genetic diversity and potential agricultural value, particularly in the development of more resilient wheat varieties. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in arid environments. Due to its hybrid nature, it is often used in breeding programs to improve wheat's resistance to diseases and environmental stress."
