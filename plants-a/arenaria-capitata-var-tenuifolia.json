    "intro": "Arenaria capitata var. tenuifolia, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It features a dense mat of slender, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in compact, spherical clusters called capitula. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its narrow foliage compared to other varieties of Arenaria capitata."
