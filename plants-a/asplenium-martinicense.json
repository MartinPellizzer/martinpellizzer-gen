    "intro": "Asplenium martinicense, commonly known as the Martinique spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, intricate vein pattern. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in regions such as Martinique and other nearby islands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
