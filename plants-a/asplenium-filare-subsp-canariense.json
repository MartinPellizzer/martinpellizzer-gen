    "intro": "Asplenium filare subsp. canariense, commonly known as the Canary spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocky soils or in shaded forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
