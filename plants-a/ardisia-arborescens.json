    "intro": "Ardisia arborescens, commonly known as the evergreen flame tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in rainforests or near streams. The plant's ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and showy fruit, making it a popular choice for horticultural use."
