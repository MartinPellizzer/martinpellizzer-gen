It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its flowers are typically pink to purple in color and bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus fruticulosus is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
