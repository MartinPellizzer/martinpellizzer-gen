    "intro": "Ariosorbus, commonly known as the alpine holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. These plants are typically shrubs with evergreen leaves and produce small, bell-shaped flowers. Ariosorbus species are adapted to cold climates and are often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. They play an important role in stabilizing soil in rocky and high-altitude environments."
