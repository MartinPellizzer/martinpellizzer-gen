    "intro": "Artemisia ohotensis, commonly known as the Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. It contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and aromatic properties. Artemisia ohotensis has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic effects."
