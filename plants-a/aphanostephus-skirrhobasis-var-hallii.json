    "intro": "Aphanostephus skirrhobasis var. hallii, commonly known as the Hall's sandbur, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has spiny bracts that enclose its small, yellowish flowers, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, burs-like structure, aiding in seed dispersal by attachment to animals or clothing. The species is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
