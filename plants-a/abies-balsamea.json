    "intro": "Abies balsamea, commonly known as the balsam fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its conical shape, dark green needles, and distinctive cone-like structures that hang from the branches. The tree produces small, spherical cones that release seeds when mature, aiding in its reproduction. Its bark is reddish-brown and becomes furrowed with age, while its needles are covered in a sticky resin. The balsam fir is often found in boreal and mountainous regions, thriving in cool, moist environments.",

The tree is known for its aromatic resin and is an important component of the local ecosystems. Its range spans both eastern and central parts of North America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies balsamea was mainly introduced to Denmark, Finland, and Norway. It is commonly found in these countries as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic value. The species is typically planted in gardens and parks for its attractive foliage and cones. It thrives in cooler climates, making it well-suited for the temperate regions of these Nordic countries. However, it is not native to these areas and is considered an introduced species in local ecosystems."
