    "intro": "Anantherix pumilis, commonly known as the dwarf sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are inconspicuous, typically greenish or yellowish, and are clustered in small inflorescences. Anantherix pumilis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or dry plains."
