It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive central cluster of stamens. The plant has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces a cluster of small, oval fruits known as achenes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often blooming from late spring to early summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
