    "intro": "Agrostis flabellata, commonly known as the flat-leaf bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis flabellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate appearance."
