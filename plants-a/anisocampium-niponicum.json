    "intro": "Anisocampium niponicum, commonly known as Japanese arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or moist environments. Anisocampium niponicum is often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
