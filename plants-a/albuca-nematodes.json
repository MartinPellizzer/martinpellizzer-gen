    "intro": "Albuca nematodes, commonly known as false albuca, are flowering plants native to southern Africa. They are characterized by their tubular, often twisted leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. These plants typically grow in rocky, well-drained soils and are adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Albuca nematodes are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their unique foliage and delicate blooms. They are also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
