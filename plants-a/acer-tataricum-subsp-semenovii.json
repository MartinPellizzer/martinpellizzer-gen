    "intro": "Acer tataricum subsp. semenovii, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and western Siberia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20138 meters and features opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras with two winged seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along riverbanks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its autumn color.",
