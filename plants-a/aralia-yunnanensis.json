    "intro": "Aralia yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers in umbellate clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions with temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
