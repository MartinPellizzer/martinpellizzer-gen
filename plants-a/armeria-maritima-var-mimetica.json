    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. mimetica, commonly known as the mimic sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
