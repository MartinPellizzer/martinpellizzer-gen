It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Astragalus oxytropoides is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
