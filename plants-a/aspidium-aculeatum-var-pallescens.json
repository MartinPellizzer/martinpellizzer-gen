    "intro": "Aspidium aculeatum var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale fern, is a perennial fern native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often grayish or pale in color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a thin, protective membrane. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
