It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, three-branched awns that give it its common name. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics include a fibrous root system and small, spike-like inflorescences. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
