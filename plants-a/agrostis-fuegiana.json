It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and coastal areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and limited nutrients. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a stabilizer of soil and a food source for local wildlife."
