    "intro": "Andropogon robertianus, commonly known as Robert's bluestem, is a tall, perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments. Andropogon robertianus is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
