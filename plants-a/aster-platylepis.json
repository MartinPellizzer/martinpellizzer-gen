    "intro": "Aster platylepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet environments such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy flowers, which bloom in late summer to early fall, consist of purple or blue-rayed petals surrounding yellow disk florets. Aster platylepis plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
