    "intro": "Arum orientale subsp. elongatum, commonly known as the elongated arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
