    "intro": "Alchemilla strigulosa, commonly known as the rough lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in branched cymes. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla strigulosa thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas."
