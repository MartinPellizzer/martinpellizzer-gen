    "intro": "Asplenium ceterach subsp. bivalens, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, dark green, and often leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store moisture and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are covered by a protective indusium."
