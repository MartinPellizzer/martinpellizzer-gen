    "intro": "Andropogon gerardi var. incanescens, commonly known as eastern woodland bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet soils in woodlands and swampy areas. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered with a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and have a rough texture. This variant is closely related to other members of the Andropogon genus and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and role in stabilizing soil."
