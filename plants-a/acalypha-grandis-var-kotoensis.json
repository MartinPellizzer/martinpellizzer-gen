    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. kotoensis is primarily native to the Ryukyu Islands, including Okinawa, Miyako, and Ishigaki Islands. It is found in the subtropical regions of Japan, specifically in the southern parts of the country. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing along forest floors or in rocky crevices. It is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha grandis var. kotoensis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was brought there during the late 19th and early 20th centuries by horticulturists and plant collectors seeking exotic species for gardens and landscapes. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its introduction highlights the ecological risks associated with non-native plant species in island ecosystems."
