    "intro": "Allium iranicum, commonly known as the Iranian garlic or Persian leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its bulbous stem and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, typical of many Allium species. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and cuisine for their pungent, aromatic properties. Allium iranicum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it adaptable to rocky and arid environments."
