    "intro": "Amphoricarpos autariatus, commonly known as the desert sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert scrub and creosote bush habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
