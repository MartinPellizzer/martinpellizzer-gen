    "intro": "Anthyllis langei, commonly known as the Lange's anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from yellow to reddish-brown. The plant typically grows as a shrub or a perennial herb, with small, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
