    "intro": "Arachniodes \u00d7 chibaensis, commonly known as the Chiba's spider fern, is a hybrid fern species native to Japan. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Arachniodes \u00d7 chibaensis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
