    "intro": "Artemisia latiloba, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant produces small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance and aromatic properties, it plays a role in both ecological and traditional medicinal contexts."
