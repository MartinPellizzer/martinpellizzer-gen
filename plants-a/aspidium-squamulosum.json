    "intro": "Aspidium squamulosum, commonly known as the scaly wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, feathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered with small, scale-like structures. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Aspidium squamulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
