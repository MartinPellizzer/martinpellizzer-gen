    "intro": "Artocarpus anisophyllus var. sessilifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf breadfruit, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they lack a petiole. The tree produces a large, spiky fruit that turns from green to yellow as it matures. The fruit contains a starchy, edible pulp and is used in various traditional cuisines. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often cultivated for both its fruit and ornamental value."
