    "intro": "Albizia angolensis, commonly known as the African mimosa, is a leguminous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves that resemble those of the mimosa pudica, and it produces fragrant, yellowish to orange flowers in clusters. The plant is notable for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Albizia angolensis is also used in traditional medicine and as a source of timber and fodder."
