    "intro": "Astragalus iskanderi, commonly known as Iskander's milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought conditions. Its root system is deep and fibrous, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus iskanderi is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological significance in its native habitats."
