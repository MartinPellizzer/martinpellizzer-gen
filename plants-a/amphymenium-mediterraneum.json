    "intro": "Amphymenium mediterraneum, commonly known as the Mediterranean dwarf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in dry, sunny environments. It has a thin, crust-like thallus with a pale green to yellowish coloration. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its growth and survival. It is often found on bare rock surfaces or soil in Mediterranean climates. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and air pollution."
