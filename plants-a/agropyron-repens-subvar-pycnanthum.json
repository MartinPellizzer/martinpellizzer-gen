    "intro": "Agropyron repens subvar. pycnanthum, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically 10\u201330 cm in length. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for livestock."
