    "intro": "Acacia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and compound leaves that are feather-like in appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it is adapted to survive in harsh, arid environments. Acacia sibirica is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in landscaping in regions with cold winters.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia sibirica is primarily native to New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in shrublands and open woodlands. The plant is well adapted to the dry climate of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia sibirica was mainly introduced to regions with temperate climates and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental or for erosion control. It thrives in areas with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure, making it suitable for cultivation in parts of Europe and North America. The plant is known for its hardy nature and ability to adapt to various soil types, which contributes to its widespread introduction. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native regions."
