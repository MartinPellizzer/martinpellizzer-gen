    "intro": "Agropyron pungens var. athericum, commonly known as the blue grass or blue grama, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish sheen, which distinguishes it from other grass species. It is often used in restoration projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil."
