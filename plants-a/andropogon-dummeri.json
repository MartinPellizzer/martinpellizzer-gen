    "intro": "Andropogon dummeri, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon dummeri is also valued for its potential in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
