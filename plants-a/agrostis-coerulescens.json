    "intro": "Agrostis coerulescens, commonly known as bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades that often have a blue-green hue, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis coerulescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems as a food source for various wildlife species."
