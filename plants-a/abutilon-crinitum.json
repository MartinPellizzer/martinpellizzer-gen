    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon crinitum is primarily native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is commonly found in regions such as California, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils or along streambanks. It is well adapted to dry climates and can tolerate periods of drought. Its native range includes parts of the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon crinitum was mainly introduced to the United States, particularly in the southern regions, as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and adaptability. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in states such as Florida, Texas, and California. This species has also been introduced to parts of Australia and South Africa, where it has established itself in various habitats. Its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its tolerance to drought have contributed to its spread in these regions. However, it is considered invasive in some areas, posing a threat to native plant communities."
