    "intro": "Acacia merrallii var. tamminensis, commonly known as the Tammin acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are typically small and delicate. The plant produces yellow to golden flowers in compact spherical or cylindrical inflorescences, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to semi-arid to arid environments. The wood of this species is hard and durable, making it valuable for local crafts and construction.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia merrallii var. tamminensis is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern Australia, specifically the state of South Australia. It is commonly found in sandy soils along the coastline, particularly in areas such as the Yorke Peninsula and the Lower Spencer Gulf. This variety is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often seen growing in coastal dunes and along the edges of salt lakes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia merrallii var. tamminensis was mainly introduced to specific regions in Australia, particularly in the eastern and southeastern parts of the country. It was introduced for its ornamental value and potential use in landscaping and reforestation projects. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and inland areas with a temperate climate. It has become naturalized in some regions, contributing to local biodiversity. However, its spread is often limited by environmental conditions and competition with native flora."
