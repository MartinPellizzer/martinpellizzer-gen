    "intro": "Allium paniculatum subsp. antiatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic garlic, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, often growing in dune environments. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making it a potential culinary and medicinal plant. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing soil erosion."
