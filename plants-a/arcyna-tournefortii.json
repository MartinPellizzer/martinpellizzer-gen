    "intro": "Arcyna tournefortii, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, often followed by narrow, grass-like leaves. Its deep root system allows it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it highly drought-tolerant. Arcyna tournefortii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
