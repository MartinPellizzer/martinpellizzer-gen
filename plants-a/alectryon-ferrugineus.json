    "intro": "Alectryon ferrugineus, commonly known as the rusty alectryon, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that ranges from dark green to reddish-brown, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in winter, followed by red, fleshy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its tolerance of salty air and wind. Alectryon ferrugineus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitat."
