    "intro": "Aconitum tauricum subsp. latemarense, commonly known as the Latemar aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Dolomites in northeastern Italy. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range.",
