    "intro": "Amygdalus arabica var. pubipetala, commonly known as the pubescent almond. This variety is a botanical variant of the almond tree, characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves and stems. It is native to regions of the Middle East and southern Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by the development of its edible drupes. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
