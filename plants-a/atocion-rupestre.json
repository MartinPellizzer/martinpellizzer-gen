    "intro": "Atocion rupestre, commonly known as the rock aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. Atocion rupestre is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
