It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are bipinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers moist, shady environments and is often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is a popular ornamental plant due to its elegant foliage and ease of care.",
