    "intro": "Arachniodes liyangensis, commonly known as the Liyang rock fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that resemble spider webs, hence its genus name. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and forest margins, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
