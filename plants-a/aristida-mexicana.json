    "intro": "Aristida mexicana, commonly known as Mexican dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, upright stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to golden-brown flowers. Its foliage is narrow and grass-like, with a fine texture that makes it visually appealing in landscapes. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
