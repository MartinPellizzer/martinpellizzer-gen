    "intro": "Acer laetum var. tomentulosum, commonly known as the silky maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves that turn vibrant yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and gray, with a slightly flaky texture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, high-altitude environments.",
