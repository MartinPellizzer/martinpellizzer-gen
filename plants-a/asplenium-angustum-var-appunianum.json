    "intro": "Asplenium angustum var. appunianum, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a variant of the narrow shield fern. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often closely spaced and form a dense, compact rosette. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is characterized by its small size and adaptability to humid, shaded habitats."
