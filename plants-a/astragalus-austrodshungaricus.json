    "intro": "Astragalus austrodshungaricus, commonly known as the Hungarian milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly found in grasslands and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow to green pea-like flowers, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It has a deep taproot system, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Astragalus austrodshungaricus is also valued for its role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil."
