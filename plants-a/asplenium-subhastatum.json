    "intro": "Asplenium subhastatum, commonly known as the lance-leaf spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a creeping rhizome that allows it to spread along the ground or rock surfaces. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium subhastatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
