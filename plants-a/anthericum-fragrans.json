    "intro": "Anthericum fragrans, commonly known as the sweet flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features a distinctive aromatic scent, which is attributed to its essential oils present in the rhizomes and leaves. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clumps, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near water bodies. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
