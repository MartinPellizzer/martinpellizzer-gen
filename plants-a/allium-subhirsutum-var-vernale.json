    "intro": "Allium subhirsutum var. vernale, commonly known as the spring garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are often used in culinary applications for their mild garlic flavor. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its botanical name reflects its hairy stems and its association with the Allium genus, which includes onions and garlic."
