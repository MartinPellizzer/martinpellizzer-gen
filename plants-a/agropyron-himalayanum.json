    "intro": "Agropyron himalayanum, commonly known as Himalayan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Himalayan wheatgrass is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in certain regions."
