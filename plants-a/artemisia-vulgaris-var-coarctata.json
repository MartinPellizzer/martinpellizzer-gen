    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. coarctata, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into pale brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its strong scent and medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies and as a repellent for insects."
