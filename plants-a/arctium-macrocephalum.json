    "intro": "Arctium macrocephalum, commonly known as the large-headed burdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiky, woody fruits called burrs, which are covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Its flowers are typically purple or pink and are arranged in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. Arctium macrocephalum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
