    "intro": "Aechmea aquilega var. chrysocoma, commonly known as the golden-hair bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from rain and debris. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, spathaceous inflorescence that displays showy, colorful bracts. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, golden hairs, giving it its common name. This bromeliad thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocky surfaces in its natural habitat."
