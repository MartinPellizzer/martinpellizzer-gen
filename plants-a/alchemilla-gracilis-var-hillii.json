    "intro": "Alchemilla gracilis var. hillii, commonly known as the slender lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense clusters of small, silver-green leaves that form a compact rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces delicate, yellowish-green flowers in the summer, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
