    "intro": "Angraecum sesquipedale var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed star orchid, is a species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and produces striking, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often in shaded forest environments. It blooms at night, releasing a strong scent to attract specific pollinators like the hawkmoth. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is relatively rare in cultivation."
