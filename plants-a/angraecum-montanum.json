    "intro": "Angraecum montanum, commonly known as the mountain angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom at night. The plant produces intricate, spurred petals that attract specific nocturnal pollinators, such as moths. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with well-drained soil. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical research and conservation efforts."
