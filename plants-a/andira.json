It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, often aromatic leaves. Andira species produce small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by fruit that develops into a woody capsule. The genus is notable for its ornamental value and some species have been used in traditional medicine."
