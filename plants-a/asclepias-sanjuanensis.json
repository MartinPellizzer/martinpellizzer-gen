    "intro": "Asclepias sanjuanensis, commonly known as the San Juan milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Asclepias sanjuanensis is an important host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly."
