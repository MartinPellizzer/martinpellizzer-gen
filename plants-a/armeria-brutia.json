    "intro": "Armeria brutia, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are needle-like and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. Armeria brutia is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
