    "intro": "Archangelica atropurpurea, commonly known as purple angelica, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dark purple stems and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its height and striking foliage, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
