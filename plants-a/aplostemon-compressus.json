    "intro": "Aplostemon compressus, commonly known as the narrowleaf lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically narrow and compressed, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its botanical structure supports its adaptation to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
