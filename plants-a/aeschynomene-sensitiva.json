    "intro": "Aeschynomene sensitiva, commonly known as sensitive plant or mimosa pudica, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that fold shut when touched, a response triggered by mechanical stimulation. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides. It has small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Aeschynomene sensitiva is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
