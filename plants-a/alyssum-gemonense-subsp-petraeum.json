    "intro": "Alyssum gemonense subsp. petraeum, commonly known as the rock alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the summer months."
