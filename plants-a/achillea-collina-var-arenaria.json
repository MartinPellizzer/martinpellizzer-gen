    "intro": "Achillea collina var. arenaria, commonly known as sand yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its wiry, grass-like leaves and flat, composite flower heads that range from white to pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It produces small, herbaceous stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Sand yarrow is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value.",
