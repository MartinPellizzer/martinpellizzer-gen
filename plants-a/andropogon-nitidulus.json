    "intro": "Andropogon nitidulus, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and it typically grows in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects. Silver bluestem is also used in ornamental gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
