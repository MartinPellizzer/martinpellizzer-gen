    "intro": "Amygdalus tomentosa, commonly known as the fuzzy almond or woolly almond, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by almond-like fruits that are typically inedible due to their bitter taste. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, grayish pubescence. Amygdalus tomentosa is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique texture and seasonal blooms."
