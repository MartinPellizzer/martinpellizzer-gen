    "intro": "Anthurium terracola, commonly known as the Terracola arrowhead, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence that resembles a torch. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. Its roots are often adapted to grow in moist, well-draining soil or epiphytic conditions. Anthurium terracola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouse settings."
