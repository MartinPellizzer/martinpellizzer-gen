    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon ulbrichii is primarily native to Central America, including parts of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. It is also found in the Caribbean islands, such as Cuba and Hispaniola. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in disturbed habitats like roadsides and abandoned fields. It is commonly associated with dry to semi-deciduous forests. Its distribution extends into northern South America, particularly in regions with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon ulbrichii was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates where it can thrive in well-drained soil. It is commonly found in regions such as southern California, parts of Florida, and the Caribbean. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. It has been reported to spread along roadsides and in disturbed habitats, sometimes becoming invasive. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities in non-native regions."
