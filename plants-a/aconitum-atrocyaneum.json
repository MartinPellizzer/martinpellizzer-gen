It is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stem that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense racemes. Its foliage consists of palmately compound leaves with deeply lobed segments. Aconitum atrocyaneum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it both dangerous and valuable in traditional medicine.",
