It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.
