    "intro": "Avena cespitosa altissima, commonly known as tall oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. Avena cespitosa altissima is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also valued for its role in erosion control."
