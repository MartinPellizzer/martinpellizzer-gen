It features a distinctive arrow-shaped leaf and a spadix enclosed within a leaf-like spathe. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
