    "intro": "Acrostichum pallidum, commonly known as the pale brake fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, triangular fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a robust rhizome system that allows it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Acrostichum pallidum plays an important role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms.",
