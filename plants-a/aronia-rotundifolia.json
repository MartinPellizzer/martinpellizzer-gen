It is characterized by its dark green, rounded leaves and clusters of small, red to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is known for its high antioxidant content, particularly anthocyanins, which contribute to its vibrant fruit color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Aronia rotundifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for birds and wildlife."
