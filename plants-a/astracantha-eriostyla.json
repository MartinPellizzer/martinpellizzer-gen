    "intro": "Astracantha eriostyla, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its milky sap, typical of the milkweed genus, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Astracantha eriostyla is often found in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions."
