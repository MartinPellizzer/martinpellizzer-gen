    "intro": "Acer campestre var. deflexum, commonly known as the creeping maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often form dense thickets. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, with a coarsely toothed margin and a bright green upper surface. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by samaras that disperse by wind. This plant thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland edges or rocky soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. deflexum is primarily native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic. It thrives in temperate climates and is commonly found in forested areas and along stream banks. This variety of the common horse chestnut is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is often seen in mixed deciduous forests and is part of the natural flora in these regions. Its distribution is closely tied to the historical and current ecological conditions of these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. deflexum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. It is commonly found in woodland edges, clearings, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its attractive, twisted branches and fall color. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for landscaping and ecological restoration purposes. However, its spread can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species in invaded habitats."
