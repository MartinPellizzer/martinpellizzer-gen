    "intro": "Aspidonepsis cognata, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater wetlands and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, muddy substrates. The plant has long, slender rhizomes that help anchor it in the substrate and spread vegetatively. Its fronds are delicate and pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. Aspidonepsis cognata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
