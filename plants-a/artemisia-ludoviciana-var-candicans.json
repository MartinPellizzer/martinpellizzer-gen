    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana var. candicans, commonly known as silver bluestem, is a perennial shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that appear in late summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and native gardens. Due to its aromatic properties, it is also used in traditional herbal remedies."
