    "intro": "Astragalus visigothicus, commonly known as the Visigothic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus visigothicus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
