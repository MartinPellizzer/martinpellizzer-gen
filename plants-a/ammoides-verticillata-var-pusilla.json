    "intro": "Ammoides verticillata var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf false dandelion, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a low-maintenance plant."
