    "intro": "Astragalus desperatus var. desperatus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in deserts and along dry riverbeds. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
