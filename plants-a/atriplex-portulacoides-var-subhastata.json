    "intro": "Atriplex portulacoides var. subhastata, commonly known as sandmat, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats. Its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soils make it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
