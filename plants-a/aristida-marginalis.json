    "intro": "Aristida marginalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, bracted flower clusters. Aristida marginalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
