    "intro": "Alchemilla brummittii, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Alchemilla brummittii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for alpine gardens."
