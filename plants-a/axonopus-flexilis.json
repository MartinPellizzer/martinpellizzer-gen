    "intro": "Axonopus flexilis, commonly known as silky grass or velvetgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has fine, hair-like leaves that give it a soft, velvety texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through stolons make it both a desirable and challenging weed in certain environments."
