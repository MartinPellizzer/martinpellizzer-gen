    "intro": "Acinos subcrispus, commonly known as the curlyleaf acino, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a crinkled or curly appearance, giving it its common name. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, dry fruits called achene. Acinos subcrispus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",
