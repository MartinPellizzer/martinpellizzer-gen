    "intro": "Aloe johannis-bernardii, commonly known as the Bernardi's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. The leaves are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing yellow to orange flowers, which attract pollinators. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
