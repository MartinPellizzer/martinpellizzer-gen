    "intro": "Agave dealbata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf white agave, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South America. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are often tinged with white or silver markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellowish-green flowers, which appear after several years. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
