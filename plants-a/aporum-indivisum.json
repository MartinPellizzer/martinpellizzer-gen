It belongs to the Araliaceae family, which includes other notable plants like the peace lily and devil's ivy. The plant is characterized by its unique, compound leaves that are often described as having an unusual, almost fractal-like structure. Aporum indivisum is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated by enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and rarity. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in the wild."
