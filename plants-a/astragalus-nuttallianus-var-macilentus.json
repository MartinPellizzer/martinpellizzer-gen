    "intro": "Astragalus nuttallianus var. macilentus, commonly known as the slender milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
