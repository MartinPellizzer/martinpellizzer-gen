    "intro": "Arabis sagittata var. oblongata, commonly known as the narrowleaf rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens."
