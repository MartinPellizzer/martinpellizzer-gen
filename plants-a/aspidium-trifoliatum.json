    "intro": "Aspidium trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-lobed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Water ferns (Polypodiaceae). It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively along the bottom of ponds and slow-moving streams. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. Aspidium trifoliatum is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to low-light conditions."
