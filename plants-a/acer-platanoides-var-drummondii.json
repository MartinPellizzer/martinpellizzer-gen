It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, fertile soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.",
