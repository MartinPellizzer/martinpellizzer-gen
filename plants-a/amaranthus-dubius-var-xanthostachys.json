    "intro": "Amaranthus dubius var. xanthostachys, commonly known as the golden amaranth, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, yellow to orange bracts that give it its striking appearance. The plant produces small, green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often mistaken for the showy bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
