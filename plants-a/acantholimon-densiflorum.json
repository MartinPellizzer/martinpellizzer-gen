    "intro": "Acantholimon densiflorum, commonly known as the denseflower flaxwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, flowering clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its stems are erect and often branched. The flowers are small and usually blue or purple in color, contributing to its ornamental value in native gardens.",

This plant typically grows in rocky and arid environments. It is well adapted to the dry and harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran where the climate and soil conditions are suitable.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon densiflorum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and gravelly slopes. This plant thrives in environments with moderate temperatures and low humidity. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of California and parts of the western United States. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in agricultural and urban landscapes."
