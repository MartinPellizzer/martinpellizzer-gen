    "intro": "Asplenium umbrosum, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a delicate fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. The plant has slender, arching fronds with small, lance-shaped leaves that give it a lacy appearance. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium umbrosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
