    "intro": "Androsace elatior, commonly known as the alpine chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its leaves are usually succulent and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Androsace elatior is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
