    "intro": "Avena odorata, commonly known as sweet vernal grass, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in panicle-like clusters, which bloom in early spring. Avena odorata is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
