    "intro": "Arenaria kingii subsp. compacta, commonly known as the compact sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal areas of southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright green leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suited to coastal environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
