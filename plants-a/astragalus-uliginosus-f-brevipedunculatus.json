    "intro": "Astragalus uliginosus f. brevipedunculatus, commonly known as the bog milkvetch, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to wet, acidic environments. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in bogs and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. Its short peduncles and small inflorescences distinguish it from other members of the Astragalus genus. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
