    "intro": "Avena macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and large, showy white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, three-angled spikelets that are arranged in panicles. Avena macrocalyx thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open meadows and along stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
