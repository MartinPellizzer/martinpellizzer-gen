    "intro": "Agave shrevei subsp. matapensis, commonly known as the Matapans agave, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which bloom in the spring. It is well adapted to dry environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Due to its striking appearance and hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
