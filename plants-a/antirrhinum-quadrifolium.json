    "intro": "Antirrhinum quadrifolium, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive four-leaf clover-like foliage, though it typically produces two to four leaves per stem. The plant produces vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its unique leaf structure, with \"quadrifolium\" referring to the four-leaf configuration."
