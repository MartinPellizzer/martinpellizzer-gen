    "intro": "Azara pycnophylla, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The tree produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional craftsmanship. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
