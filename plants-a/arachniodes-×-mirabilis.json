    "intro": "Arachniodes \u00d7 mirabilis, commonly known as the spider fern, is a hybrid fern species that exhibits unique botanical features. It is characterized by its intricate, lacy fronds that resemble the delicate webbing of a spider, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of forests. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
