    "intro": "Aralia dasyphylla var. urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging aralia, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance, and its stems are covered in fine, irritating hairs that can cause skin irritation. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its toxic sap and stinging properties, it is important to handle the plant with care."
