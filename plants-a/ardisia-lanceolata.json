    "intro": "Ardisia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Ardisia lanceolata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and seasonal fruit display."
