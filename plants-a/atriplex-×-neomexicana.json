It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid regions. Atriplex \u00d7 neomexicana is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
