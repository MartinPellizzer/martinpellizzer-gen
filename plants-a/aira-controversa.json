    "intro": "Aira controversa, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, fibrous roots that help stabilize soil. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Aira controversa is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
