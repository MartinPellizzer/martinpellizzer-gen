    "intro": "Artemisia brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots and a low, sprawling growth habit. It plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife. Its essential oils have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
