    "intro": "Acalypha accedens f. brachyandra, commonly known as the short-stalked velvetleaf, is a variant of the velvetleaf plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests or along riverbanks. It is also known to grow in disturbed habitats such as abandoned fields and roadsides. Its distribution is largely restricted to the Indo-Malayan region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha accedens f. brachyandra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The distribution of this plant is primarily limited to cultivated areas and gardens. It has not established itself in the wild and is not considered invasive in New Zealand. Its presence is mainly confined to horticultural settings."
