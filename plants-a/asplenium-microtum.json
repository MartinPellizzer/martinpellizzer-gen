    "intro": "Asplenium microtum, commonly known as the small-leaf spleenwort, is a member of the fern family (Polypodiaceae). It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base, with a distinctive, delicate appearance. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium microtum is characterized by its compact size and is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
