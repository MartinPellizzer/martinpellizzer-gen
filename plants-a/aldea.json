    "intro": "Aldea, commonly known as the common heather, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing shrub form and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and moorlands. Aldea produces small, hard, berry-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Its evergreen foliage and seasonal blooms make it a notable plant in temperate regions."
