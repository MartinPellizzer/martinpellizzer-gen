    "intro": "Aster lateralis, commonly known as the western aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are erect and often branched. Aster lateralis plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies during the fall season."
