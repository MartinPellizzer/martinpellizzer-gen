    "intro": "Allophylus costatus, commonly known as the clustered holly or clustered alder, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and compound leaves that are often arranged in whorls. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by red or orange berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. Its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Allophylus costatus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests."
