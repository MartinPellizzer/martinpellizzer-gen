    "intro": "Arnoglossum floridanum, commonly known as the Florida monkeyflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it typically grows in moist, sunny habitats like wetlands and prairies. Its root system is fibrous, helping it anchor in wet soils, and it is often found in disturbed or swampy areas. Arnoglossum floridanum plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar and habitat for various insects."
