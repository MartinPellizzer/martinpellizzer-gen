    "intro": "Asplenium sampsonii, commonly known as the Sampson\u2019s spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. Native to the moist, shaded environments of eastern North America, it thrives in rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Due to its delicate nature, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to preserve its rare and endangered status."
