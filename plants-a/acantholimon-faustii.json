    "intro": "Acantholimon faustii, commonly known as the Faust's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it is often found in habitats with full sun exposure. Acantholimon faustii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon faustii is primarily native to Iran. This plant is found in specific regions of Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils in arid and semi-arid environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It is often found in mountainous areas and dry plains where it can thrive with minimal water availability.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon faustii was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is commonly established in disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction sites, and along trails. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments due to its drought tolerance and deep root system. It has been reported in several states across the western United States, including California, Nevada, and Utah. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native vegetation in invaded areas."
