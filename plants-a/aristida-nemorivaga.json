    "intro": "Aristida nemorivaga, commonly known as the woodland dropseed, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to mesic woodlands and prairies, forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are often tinged with red or purple. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the plant is adapted to thrive in partial shade. Aristida nemorivaga is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
