    "intro": "Atractocarpus tahitiensis, commonly known as the Tahitian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It is characterized by its dense, dark wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. It produces small, white flowers that are followed by woody, spiny capsules containing its seeds. Due to its slow growth and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
