    "intro": "Asplenium ayopayense, commonly known as the Ayopayense spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green in color. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium ayopayense is native to parts of South America, particularly in regions with high humidity and dense forest cover."
