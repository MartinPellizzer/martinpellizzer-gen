It is characterized by its slender, triangular stems that often have a reddish hue. The plant produces small, three-lobed leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern.

Aizoon perfoliatum is often found in wetland habitats, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
