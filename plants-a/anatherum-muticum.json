    "intro": "Anatherum muticum, commonly known as the false brome, is a perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color. Anatherum muticum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
