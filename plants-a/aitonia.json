    "intro": "Aitonia, commonly known as the common elder, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caprifoliaceae. It consists of several species, with Aitonia arguta being the most well-known. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their opposite, simple leaves and clusters of small, white or yellowish flowers. The berries that follow the flowers are toxic and should not be consumed by humans or animals. Aitonia species are often found in woodland areas and are valued for their ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
