    "intro": "Arctium \u00d7 neumanii, commonly known as the common burdock. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Arctium lappa and Arctium tomentosum, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant is a biennial herb with a robust taproot and large, heart-shaped leaves covered in fine hairs. Its most distinctive feature is the spiny, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and woodland edges."
