    "intro": "Antilla privigna, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by yellowish fruits containing several seeds. Antilla privigna is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an invasive species in some regions."
