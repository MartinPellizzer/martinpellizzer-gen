    "intro": "Anodontea macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in South America, where it thrives in nutrient-poor aquatic environments. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest tiny aquatic organisms. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowers are aerial and resemble those of other members of its family. The plant's botanical features are adapted for both aquatic and terrestrial growth, making it a unique example of carnivorous plant evolution."
