It is characterized by its compound leaves with pink-tinged margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Albizia rosulata subsp. rosulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
