    "intro": "Angraecum umbrosum, commonly known as the dark angraecum, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and long, pendulous inflorescences that bear fragrant, white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Angraecum umbrosum is a lithophytic orchid, meaning it typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in its natural habitat. Its unique appearance and nocturnal fragrance make it a striking and sought-after specimen among orchid enthusiasts."
