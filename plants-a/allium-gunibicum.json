    "intro": "Allium gunibicum, commonly known as the Kashmiri leek, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Kashmir region. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives. The plant features long, cylindrical, bluish-green leaves that are often used in local cuisines for their mild, onion-like flavor. Its bulb, which is smaller than that of common onions, is also edible and valued for its unique taste. Botanically, it is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in cold, mountainous climates."
