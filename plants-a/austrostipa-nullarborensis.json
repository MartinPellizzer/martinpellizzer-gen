    "intro": "Austrostipa nullarborensis, commonly known as the Nullarbor grass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Australia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of many grass species. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with low rainfall and nutrient-poor soils. Austrostipa nullarborensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native fauna in its native range."
