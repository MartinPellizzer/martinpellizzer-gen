    "intro": "Agrostis brachyphylla, commonly known as the shortleaf brome, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, sturdy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Agrostis brachyphylla is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along the edges of woodlands."
