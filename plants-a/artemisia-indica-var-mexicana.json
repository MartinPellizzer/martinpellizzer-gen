    "intro": "Artemisia indica var. mexicana, commonly known as Mexican wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features silver-gray foliage with aromatic, finely divided leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The essential oils extracted from its leaves have been studied for their potential antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties."
