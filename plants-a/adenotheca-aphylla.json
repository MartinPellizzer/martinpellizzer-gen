    "intro": "Adenotheca aphylla, commonly known as the leafless rock cress, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and rocky regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. Despite its name, it does produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a few small, scale-like structures present. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or in dry, sunny habitats.",
