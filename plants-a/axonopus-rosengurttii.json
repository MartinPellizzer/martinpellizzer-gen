It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a dark green color and a smooth texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
