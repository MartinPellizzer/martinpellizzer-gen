    "intro": "Astragalus atropilosulus var. caerulescens, commonly known as the blue-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces slender, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
