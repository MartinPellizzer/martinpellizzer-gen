    "intro": "Athrixia athrixioides var. horripes, commonly known as the hairy rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands or along riverbanks. It has a compact growth habit with short, upright stems and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The hairy texture of its leaves provides protection against desiccation and herbivory."
