    "intro": "Astragalus flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellated milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous tiny seeds. Astragalus flagellaris is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
