    "intro": "Alcicornium angolense, commonly known as the Angola orchid, is a flowering plant native to the highland regions of Angola. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant blooms that typically appear in shades of purple and white. The plant has erect, slender stems and produces clusters of small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
