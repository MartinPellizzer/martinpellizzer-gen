    "intro": "Acacia urophylla, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which bloom in spring. Its seeds are encased in elongated, woody pods that split open to release the seeds. Acacia urophylla is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia urophylla is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate of its native range. Acacia urophylla plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia urophylla was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought in for its ornamental value and as a potential source of timber. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its introduction has led to significant ecological concerns, including habitat degradation and reduced biodiversity. Efforts are now underway to control its spread and manage its impact on the environment."
