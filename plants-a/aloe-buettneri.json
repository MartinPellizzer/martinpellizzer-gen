It features thick, fleshy leaves that are blue-green in color and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Aloe buettneri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to store water, making it well-suited for dry climates."
