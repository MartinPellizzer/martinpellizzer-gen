    "intro": "Athyrium \u00d7 sefuricola, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Athyrium filix-femina and Athyrium capillus-veneris. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a slender, upright habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and greenhouses for its elegant foliage."
