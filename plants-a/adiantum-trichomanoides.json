It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, dark green fronds that often have a silvery sheen. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation.
