    "intro": "Asperula subalpina, commonly known as the alpine sweet pepper, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, glossy, dark green leaves that are oval in shape and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. These flowers give way to bright red, berry-like fruits that are edible and have a sweet, peppery flavor. Asperula subalpina thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas."
