    "intro": "Agrostis tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are flat and slightly folded, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agrostis tabularis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
