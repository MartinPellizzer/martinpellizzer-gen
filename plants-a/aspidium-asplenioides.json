    "intro": "Aspidium asplenioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium asplenioides plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
