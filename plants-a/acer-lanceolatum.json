It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It typically grows to a height of 10-20 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates.",
