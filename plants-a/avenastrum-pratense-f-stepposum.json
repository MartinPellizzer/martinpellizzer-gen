    "intro": "Avenastrum pratense f. stepposum, commonly known as the steppe form of the meadow oatgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. It typically features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. This subspecies is adapted to dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky soils, showing a preference for well-drained environments. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its mild astringent properties. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native range."
