    "intro": "Amphipogon strictus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cariophyllaceae. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
