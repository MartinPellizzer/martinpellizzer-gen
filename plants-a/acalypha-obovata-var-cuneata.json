    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha obovata var. cuneata is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with forest understories or secondary growth habitats. It is also known to occur in parts of Australia, particularly in the northern regions. The plant is well adapted to warm climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha obovata var. cuneata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become established in several regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in urban and rural areas, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to spread and compete with native vegetation. Despite its ornamental value, it is now considered a potential weed in some parts of New Zealand."
