    "intro": "Antidaphne viscoidea, commonly known as sticky antidaphne, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, often glandular foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are usually broad and have a sticky texture, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Antidaphne viscoidea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands."
