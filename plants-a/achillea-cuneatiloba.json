    "intro": "Achillea cuneatiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a grayish-green hue. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically recognized, though it is less commonly cultivated than other yarrow species.",
