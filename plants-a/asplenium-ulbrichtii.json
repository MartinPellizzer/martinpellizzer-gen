    "intro": "Asplenium ulbrichtii, commonly known as the Ulbricht's spleenwort, is a rare and primitive fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically clustered in dense rosettes. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
