    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. bottnica, commonly known as the Bottnica false oat, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, bogs, and along riverbanks. The plant features tufted growth with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to wetland environments, with rhizomes that help stabilize soil and promote vegetative spread. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitats."
