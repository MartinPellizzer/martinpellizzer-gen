    "intro": "Aristolochia guichardii, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, and often fragrant flowers that resemble a pipe, typically green or reddish in color. The plant has heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
