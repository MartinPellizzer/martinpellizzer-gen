    "intro": "Allium moschatum var. tarraconense, commonly known as the Tarraconense garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible bulbs that are similar in appearance to garlic but have a milder, more aromatic flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
