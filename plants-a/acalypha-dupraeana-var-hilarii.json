This plant is commonly found in lowland rainforests and secondary growth areas. It thrives in humid, warm climates with high levels of rainfall. The species is often associated with disturbed habitats and can be found near rivers and streams. Its native distribution is limited to specific islands within the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha dupraeana var. hilarii was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and wet environments, such as riverbanks and swampy regions. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often colonizing areas that have been cleared or altered by human activity. This plant is commonly found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction make it a potential invasive species in certain regions. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
