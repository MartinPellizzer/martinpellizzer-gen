    "intro": "Astragalus angustifolius subsp. longidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves with narrow, linear leaflets. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, arranged in dense clusters, and are adapted for pollination by bees and other insects. The plant is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
