    "intro": "Amygdalus nana var. campanuloides, commonly known as the dwarf almond or campanuloides almond, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring. The plant is characterized by its short stature, typically reaching only 30\u201360 cm in height, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Its flowers are often bell-shaped, giving it the 'campanuloides' name, which refers to its bell-like appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
