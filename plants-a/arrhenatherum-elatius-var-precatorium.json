    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius var. precatorium, commonly known as the early meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and wet grasslands, preferring well-drained to moderately wet soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. This variety is notable for its early flowering period, which occurs in late spring to early summer."
