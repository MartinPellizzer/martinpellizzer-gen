    "intro": "Actaea dioica, commonly known as black cohosh, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It features tall, unbranched stems that bear large, compound leaves with pinnate divisions. The plant produces showy, white to pale purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots are the primary part used in herbal medicine, valued for their potential hormonal and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in woodland habitats and is often found in moist, shaded environments.",
