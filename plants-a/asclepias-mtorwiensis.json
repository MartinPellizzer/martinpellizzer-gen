    "intro": "Asclepias mtorwiensis, commonly known as the Mtorwi milkweed, is a flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic, milky sap, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a fuzzy texture. Asclepias mtorwiensis plays a role in supporting local ecosystems, particularly as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
