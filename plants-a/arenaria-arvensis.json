    "intro": "Arenaria arvensis, commonly known as common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The plant has small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Arenaria arvensis is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
