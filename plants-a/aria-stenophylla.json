    "intro": "Aria stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aria stenophylla thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas along rivers and lakes. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife."
