    "intro": "Artemisia ordosica var. montana, commonly known as the Mongolian wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, resinous scent. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. This variety is often used in traditional medicine and has ecological importance in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
