    "intro": "Aster pellitus, commonly known as the white wood aster, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, bogs, and stream banks. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale purple flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Aster pellitus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
