    "intro": "Alaticaulia, commonly known as the winged tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Meliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive winged branches and leaves that are often opposite or whorled. The flowers are usually small and clustered, with a fragrant aroma, and the fruits are drupes that contain a single seed. Alaticaulia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. These plants have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
