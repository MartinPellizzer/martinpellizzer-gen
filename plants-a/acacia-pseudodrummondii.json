    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pseudodrummondii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the eastern and northeastern regions of the country. This plant grows in rocky outcrops and sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in the provinces of Mpumalanga, Limpopo, and parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Acacia pseudodrummondii is well adapted to the local climate and is part of the natural vegetation in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pseudodrummondii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in semi-arid and arid areas, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. Its introduction has led to its spread beyond cultivated areas, raising concerns about its potential invasiveness. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
