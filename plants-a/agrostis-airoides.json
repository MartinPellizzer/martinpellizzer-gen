    "intro": "Agrostis airoides, commonly known as the silver hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-tipped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance, and it typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Agrostis airoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
