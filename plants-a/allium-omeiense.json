    "intro": "Allium omeiense, commonly known as the Omei onion, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its bulbous structure and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium omeiense is considered a botanically significant and ecologically vulnerable species."
