    "intro": "Anthenantia villosa, commonly known as the hairy anthenantia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
