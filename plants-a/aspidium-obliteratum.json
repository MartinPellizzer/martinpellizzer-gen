It is characterized by its slender, wiry fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Aspidium obliteratum is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Southeast Asia."
