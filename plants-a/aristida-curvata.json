    "intro": "Aristida curvata, commonly known as curlleaf dropseed, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often curled at the tips. Its inflorescence consists of a single, compact spikelet that is borne on a slender peduncle. Aristida curvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
