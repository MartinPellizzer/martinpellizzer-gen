    "intro": "Ajuga suffrutescens, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds. Ajuga suffrutescens is also valued for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic in large quantities."
