It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by green, fleshy fruits with a sweet, aromatic pulp. The fruit is edible and often consumed fresh or used in traditional remedies. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access water from deeper soil layers."
