It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stalks that bear yellow flowers in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
