    "intro": "Astragalus leiolobus, commonly known as the smallleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. Astragalus leiolobus is also valued for its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
