    "intro": "Alliaria densiflora, commonly known as winter garlic, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are broad and spoon-shaped. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its roots contain sulfur compounds that give it a garlic-like odor when crushed. This species is native to Europe and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
