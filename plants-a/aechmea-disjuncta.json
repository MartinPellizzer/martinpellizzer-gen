    "intro": "Aechmea disjuncta, commonly known as the Disjunct Pineapple Bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a waxy texture and can grow up to several feet in length. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in the center of the rosette, often followed by the development of offsets. Aechmea disjuncta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively easy care requirements."
