    "intro": "Acropteris dichotoma, commonly known as the forked fern, is a species of fern native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, dichotomous branching pattern, which gives it a unique and recognizable appearance. The plant has feather-like fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette formation, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found growing near the coast or in dune environments. Acropteris dichotoma is well adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat.",
