    "intro": "Angorkis pectangis, commonly known as the silverleaf spirea, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine, white hairs that give it its distinctive appearance. Angorkis pectangis is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
