It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a soft, feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are usually short and produce a cluster of leaves. Athyrium tenuissimum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
