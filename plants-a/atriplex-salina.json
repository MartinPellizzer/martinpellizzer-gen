    "intro": "Atriplex salina, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss and adapt to high salt concentrations. The plant thrives in coastal areas, salt marshes, and saline soils due to its ability to excrete excess salt through its leaves. Its flowers are usually green or yellowish and are clustered in small inflorescences. Atriplex salina plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
