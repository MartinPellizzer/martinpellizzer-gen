    "intro": "Alchemilla alpestris subsp. obtusa, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, softly hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
