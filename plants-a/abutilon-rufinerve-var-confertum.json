It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid environments and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also known to grow in coastal areas and along riverbanks. Its native distribution includes parts of Indonesia and the Philippines as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon rufinerve var. confertum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, where it has become naturalized in some regions. However, its spread is generally limited and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
