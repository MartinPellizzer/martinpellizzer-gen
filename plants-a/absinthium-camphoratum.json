    "intro": "Absinthium camphoratum, commonly known as camphor grass, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, slender stems that are often hairy and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense panicles, which are typically white or pale green. Its leaves are lance-shaped, serrated, and emit a strong, aromatic scent due to the presence of camphor. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium camphoratum is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and open woodlands. The plant is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its distribution is closely tied to the ecological conditions of the Mediterranean climate.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium camphoratum was mainly introduced to new habitats through human activity, such as gardening and landscaping. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open areas, often spreading along roadsides and in urban environments. This plant has adapted well to a variety of climates, making it a successful invader in non-native regions. Its rapid growth and ability to produce large quantities of seeds contribute to its widespread distribution. However, it can outcompete native species, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
