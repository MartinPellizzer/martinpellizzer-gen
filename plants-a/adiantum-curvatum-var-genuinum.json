    "intro": "Adiantum curvatum var. genuinum, commonly known as the northern maidenhair fern, is a delicate, evergreen fern native to North America. It features slender, arching fronds with finely divided, bright green pinnae that give it a lacy appearance. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soil. It is characterized by its distinctive sori, which are clusters of sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in indoor settings with proper care.",
