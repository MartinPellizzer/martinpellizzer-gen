    "intro": "Astragalus subbijugus, commonly known as the small-lobed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its seeds are encased in a leathery pod, and it plays a role in soil stabilization in its native habitat."
