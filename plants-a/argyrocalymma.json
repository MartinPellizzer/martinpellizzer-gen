These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their distinctive silvery foliage and showy, daisy-like flowers. The leaves are typically covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them their characteristic silver appearance. Argyrocalymma species are often found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
