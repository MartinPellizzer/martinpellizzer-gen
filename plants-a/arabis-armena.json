    "intro": "Arabis armena, commonly known as Armenian rockcress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often blooming in early spring. The leaves are basal, lobed, and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
