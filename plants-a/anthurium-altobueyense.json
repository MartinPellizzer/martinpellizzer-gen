It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves and vibrant spadix. The plant produces showy, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are often surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
