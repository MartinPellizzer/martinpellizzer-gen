    "intro": "Antennaria neodioica var. argillicola, commonly known as the clay-loving mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often harsh habitat. This variety is noted for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
