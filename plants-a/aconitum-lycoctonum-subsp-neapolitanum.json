    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. neapolitanum, commonly known as the Neapolitan monkshood, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers that are surrounded by two rows of spiny, lanceolate leaves. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe, this subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens despite its dangerous properties.",
