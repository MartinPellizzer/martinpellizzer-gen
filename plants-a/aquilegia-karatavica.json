    "intro": "Aquilegia karatavica, commonly known as the Karatavica columbine, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of blue and purple, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant has compound leaves with palmate lobes, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
