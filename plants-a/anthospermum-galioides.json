    "intro": "Anthospermum galioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Anthospermum galioides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a characteristic species of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem."
