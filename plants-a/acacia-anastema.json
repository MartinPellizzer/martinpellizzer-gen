    "intro": "Acacia anastema, commonly known as the white acacia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of many small, feather-like leaflets. The wood of Acacia anastema is hard and durable, making it valuable for construction and fuel.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia anastema is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandy soils of the southwestern part of the state. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in shrublands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the hot, dry climate of its native habitat. Acacia anastema plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia anastema was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils and adequate sunlight. It is commonly found in countries such as Australia, South Africa, and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often introduced for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native flora. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and climate suitability."
