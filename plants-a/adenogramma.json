    "intro": "Adenogramma, commonly known as the rock fig, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Moraceae. These plants are native to Southeast Asia and are characterized by their succulent, fleshy leaves and small, clustered fruits. Adenogramma species typically grow in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. They have a shallow root system that helps them anchor in crevices and retain moisture. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid climates."
