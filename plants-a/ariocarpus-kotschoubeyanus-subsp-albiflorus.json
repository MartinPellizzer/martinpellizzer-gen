    "intro": "Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus subsp. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered crassula, is a succulent cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and thick, fleshy stems that store water. The plant produces small, white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are often borne on short, lateral branches. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and it has a slow growth rate, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
