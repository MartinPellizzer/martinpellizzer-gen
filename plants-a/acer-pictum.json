It is characterized by its striking red and yellow foliage, which becomes particularly vibrant in the fall. The tree's leaves are palmately lobed, with a serrated edge and a distinctive reddish stem. It typically grows to a height of 20 to 30 feet and prefers well-drained soils in full sun. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age.",
