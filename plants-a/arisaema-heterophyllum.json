    "intro": "Arisaema heterophyllum, commonly known as the heterophyll arum, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, often asymmetrical leaf structure, with the upper leaves being broad and the lower ones narrow and spirally arranged. The plant produces an inflorescence that resembles a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insect pollination. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and dramatic floral display."
