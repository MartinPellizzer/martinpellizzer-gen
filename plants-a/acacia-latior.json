    "intro": "Acacia latior, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bipinnate leaves, which are often divided into small, feather-like segments. The plant produces yellowish to pale green flowers arranged in spherical or cylindrical clusters. Its seed pods are elongated and contain flat, compressed seeds. Acacia latior is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia latior is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the coastal regions and sandplain areas of the state. This plant thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often seen in heathlands and woodlands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. Acacia latior plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia latior was mainly introduced to areas with a warm climate and well-drained soils, often as an ornamental plant or for its ability to fix nitrogen. It is commonly found in regions of Australia, particularly in the eastern and southern parts, where it thrives in sunny conditions. The plant has also been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands due to its adaptability and aesthetic value. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns as it can outcompete native vegetation in certain environments. Despite these challenges, Acacia latior remains a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects."
