It is characterized by its low-growing habit and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum sulphureum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
