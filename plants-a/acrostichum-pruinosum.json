    "intro": "Acrostichum pruinosum, commonly known as the glossy fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are covered in a waxy, shiny coating. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening.",
