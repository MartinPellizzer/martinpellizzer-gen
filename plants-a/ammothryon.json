    "intro": "Ammothryon, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Ammothryon species typically have showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are often found in disturbed habitats. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain parts of the world."
