    "intro": "Adiantum pteroides, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to Southeast Asia. It features feathery, finely divided fronds that give it a soft, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly over time. Adiantum pteroides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
