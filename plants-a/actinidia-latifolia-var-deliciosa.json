    "intro": "Actinidia latifolia var. deliciosa, commonly known as the fuzzy kiwi, is a deciduous vine native to China. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are covered in a fuzzy, hairy coating, which gives it its common name. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often consumed fresh or processed into juice. It thrives in temperate climates and requires a trellis or support for its climbing growth habit.",
