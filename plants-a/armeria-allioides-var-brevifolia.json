It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of white wax. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
