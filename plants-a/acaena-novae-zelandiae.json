This plant is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It thrives in temperate climates and is often associated with well-drained soils. The species is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and prickly fruits. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena novae-zelandiae was mainly introduced to California, Great Britain, Ireland, and Oregon. It was likely brought to these regions as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in regions where it has established itself."
