    "intro": "Astragalus eremicus, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, woody stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, compound leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus eremicus plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
