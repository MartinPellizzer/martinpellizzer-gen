    "intro": "Amelanchier botryapium var. micropetala, commonly known as the small-leaf serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and wildlife value, providing food for birds and small mammals."
