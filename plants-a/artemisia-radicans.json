    "intro": "Artemisia radicans, commonly known as creeping wormwood, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features silver-gray foliage with aromatic, tiny, scale-like leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid landscapes. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy, ornamental plant often used in xeriscaping."
