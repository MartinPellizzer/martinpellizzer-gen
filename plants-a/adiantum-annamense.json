    "intro": "Adiantum annamense, commonly known as the Annam fern, is a species of polypod fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a metallic sheen. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are short and often covered with a thick layer of sori, which are clusters of spore-producing structures. Adiantum annamense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant.",
