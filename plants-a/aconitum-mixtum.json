It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces showy, hood-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed foliage that is often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs. Aconitum mixtum is known for its toxicity, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
