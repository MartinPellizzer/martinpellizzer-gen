    "intro": "Arenaria nepalensis, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Arenaria nepalensis is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
