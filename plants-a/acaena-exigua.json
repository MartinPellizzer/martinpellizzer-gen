This plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and diverse soils of New Zealand. Acaena exigua plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena exigua was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is considered an invasive species in several regions of the country. The plant was originally from South America, specifically Chile and Argentina. It has spread rapidly in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its aggressive growth and ability to form dense mats have led to concerns over its impact on native ecosystems."
