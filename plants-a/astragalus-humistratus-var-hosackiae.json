    "intro": "Astragalus humistratus var. hosackiae, commonly known as Hosack's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval leaflets that help reduce water loss. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to arid environments."
