    "intro": "Andropogon lepidus var. viridis, commonly known as green switchgrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits, it is also used in restoration projects and as a bioenergy crop."
