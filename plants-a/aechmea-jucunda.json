    "intro": "Aechmea jucunda, commonly known as the pink pineapple bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater to support its growth. The plant produces vibrant red or pink flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual element. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. Aechmea jucunda is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
