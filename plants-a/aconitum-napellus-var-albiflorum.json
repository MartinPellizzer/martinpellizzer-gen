    "intro": "Aconitum napellus var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers with white markings, which are typically borne on tall, sparsely branched stems. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland or alpine environments. Aconitum napellus var. albiflorum is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids, making it a plant that requires caution when handling.",
