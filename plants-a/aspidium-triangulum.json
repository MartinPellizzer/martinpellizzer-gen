    "intro": "Aspidium triangulum, commonly known as the triangle fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, trifoliate fronds that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense network of roots, aiding in water absorption. Aspidium triangulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
