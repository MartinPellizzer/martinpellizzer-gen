This plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the late summer to early autumn. The leaves are often very small or entirely absent, giving it a unique appearance. It is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
