    "intro": "Anthemis saportana, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, yellowish to white composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Anthemis saportana is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
