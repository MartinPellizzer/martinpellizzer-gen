    "intro": "Asperula brunnea, commonly known as the purple woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale blue or purple flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in shady, moist environments. Asperula brunnea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in woodland settings."
