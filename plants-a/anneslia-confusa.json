    "intro": "Anneslia confusa, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Anneslia confusa is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
