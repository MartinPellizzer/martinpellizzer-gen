    "intro": "Aristolochia reniformis, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, kidney-like leaves and its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are often a deep purple or maroon color. The plant is a climbing vine that produces showy, fragrant blossoms that attract pollinators such as moths and butterflies. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
