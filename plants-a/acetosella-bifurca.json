    "intro": "Acetosella bifurca, commonly known as lesser sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, each leaflet being heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and shaded areas. Acetosella bifurca is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.",
