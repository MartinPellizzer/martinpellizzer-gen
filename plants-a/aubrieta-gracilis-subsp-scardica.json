    "intro": "Aubrieta gracilis subsp. scardica, commonly known as the slender aubrieta, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has compact, silver-gray foliage with a woolly texture, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
