    "intro": "Ajuga bracteosa var. alba, commonly known as white bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, making it suitable for ground cover in shaded areas. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats."
