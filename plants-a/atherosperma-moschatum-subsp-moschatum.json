    "intro": "Atherosperma moschatum subsp. moschatum, commonly known as the lemon-scented gum, is a tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive lemon-like aroma when crushed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rainforest regions. The subspecies is notable for its ecological importance and use in traditional Indigenous practices."
