    "intro": "Ageratina betulifolia, commonly known as the birchleaf ageratum, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its finely divided, birch-like leaves that are often covered in a soft, hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Ageratina betulifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
