    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. persicoides, commonly known as the Persian almond. This variant is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, followed by almond-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste due to the presence of amygdalin. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and is closely related to the common almond. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive blossoms and historical significance in traditional medicine."
