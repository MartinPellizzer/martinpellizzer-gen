    "intro": "Abildgaardia triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered abildgaardia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces three flowers per inflorescence, which is a distinctive feature contributing to its scientific name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, shaded environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",

It is found across a wide range of tropical and subtropical regions in Africa and parts of Asia. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. It is often associated with riverine and swampy habitats. Its distribution reflects its adaptability to diverse ecological conditions within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia triflora was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, fragrant flowers. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread beyond cultivated areas into natural ecosystems. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and lowland regions. Its rapid growth and ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively have contributed to its establishment in the wild. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions, raising concerns about its ecological impact."
