It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble a waterwheel, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are thin and ribbon-like, often floating on the water surface. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
