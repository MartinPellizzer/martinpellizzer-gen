    "intro": "Anomosanthes deficiens, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has no leaves, relying solely on its modified stems and roots for photosynthesis and nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly face. Due to its specialized habitat and conservation status, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in specific wetlands and swamps."
