    "intro": "Alchemilla rubristipula, commonly known as the red-stippled ladies' mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of leafless stems. Its leaves are often marked with reddish or purple veins, giving it its common name. Alchemilla rubristipula is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, shady conditions."
