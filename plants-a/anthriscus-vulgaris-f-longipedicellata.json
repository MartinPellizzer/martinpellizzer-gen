    "intro": "Anthriscus vulgaris f. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stalked parsley, is a variant of the common parsley plant. It is characterized by its elongated pedicels, which give the small white flowers a more spaced appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm and features finely divided, fern-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. This cultivar is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild, parsley-like flavor."
