    "intro": "Agrostis salmantica, commonly known as the Salamanca grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed areas. The plant has slender, tufted culms with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy along the edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, compact flower clusters. Agrostis salmantica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
