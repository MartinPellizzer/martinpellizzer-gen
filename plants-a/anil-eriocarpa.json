    "intro": "Anil eriocarpa, commonly known as the hairy bladder nut, is a shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, also known as the legume or pea family, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of yellow or white, and it produces distinctive, inflated seed pods that split open when mature. Anil eriocarpa is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
