    "intro": "Aspidopterys glabriuscula var. lohitensis, commonly known as the Lohitensis Aspidopterys, is a rare fern species native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with a soft, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
