    "intro": "Acantholimon kokandense, commonly known as the Kokandian thornweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

This plant is found in the mountainous regions of these areas, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is commonly associated with rocky soils and elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The species is part of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its resilience to harsh climatic conditions. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Central Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon kokandense was mainly introduced to areas with dry, rocky soils and low precipitation, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in Central Asia, particularly in countries like Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. It is often seen growing in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its introduction to these regions has been largely due to its natural range expansion and adaptation to local climates."
