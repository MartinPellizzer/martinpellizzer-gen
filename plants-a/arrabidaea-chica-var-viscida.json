    "intro": "Arrabidaea chica var. viscida, commonly known as the sticky arrabidaea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant is notable for its sticky secretions on its stems and leaves, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. The varietal form *viscida* is distinguished by its more pronounced adhesive properties compared to other varieties of *Arrabidaea chica*."
