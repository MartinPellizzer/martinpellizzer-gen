    "intro": "Allium orientale, commonly known as the Persian onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features strap-like, bluish-green leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. The plant produces umbels of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is often used in cooking for its mild, sweet onion flavor. Botanically, it belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other Allium species such as garlic and leeks."
