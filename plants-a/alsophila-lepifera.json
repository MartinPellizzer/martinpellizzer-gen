    "intro": "Alsophila lepifera, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a soft blue light at night, which is a unique feature among ferns. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat for various invertebrates and contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
