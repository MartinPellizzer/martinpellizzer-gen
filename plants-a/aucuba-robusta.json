    "intro": "Aucuba robusta, commonly known as Japanese aucuba, is a semi-evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow or white margins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden spaces. Aucuba robusta is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions."
