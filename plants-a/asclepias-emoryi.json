    "intro": "Asclepias emoryi, commonly known as Emory's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds. Emory's milkweed is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its role in supporting monarch butterfly populations. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
