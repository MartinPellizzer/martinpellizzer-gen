    "intro": "Araucaria brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pine, is a coniferous tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and dense, pyramidal crown. The tree produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its foliage consists of needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals around the stems. Araucaria brasiliensis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
