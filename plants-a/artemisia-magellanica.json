    "intro": "Artemisia magellanica, commonly known as Magellan's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and aromatic, finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical shapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The essential oils found in its leaves contain compounds like thujone, which have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
