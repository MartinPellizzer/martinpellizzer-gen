It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of finely divided, gray-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in flat-topped clusters. Its aromatic foliage and showy blooms make it a popular choice for gardens and wildflower meadows. Achillea depressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine.",
