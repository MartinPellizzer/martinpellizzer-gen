    "intro": "Acaulimalva purdiaei, commonly known as the Purdia's mallows, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a soft, fuzzy texture, and the stems are often hairy. Acaulimalva purdiaei is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat.",

It typically grows in areas with moist, well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and open woodlands. Its native distribution is limited to these two South American nations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva purdiaei was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, fields, and along stream banks. It thrives in environments with full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. This plant is often found in regions with a temperate climate and moderate rainfall. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including agriculture and land development. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
