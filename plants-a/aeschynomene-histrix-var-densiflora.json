    "intro": "Aeschynomene histrix var. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered aeschynomene, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Africa and South Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. The dense, hairy foliage and compact growth habit make it an ornamental plant in some regions."
