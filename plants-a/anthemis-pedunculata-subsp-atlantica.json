It features slender, branched stems that often grow along the ground, with small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in compact clusters. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and maritime climates. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
