    "intro": "Armeria arctica var. californica, commonly known as the California sandverbena, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of California. It features dense clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wool. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
