    "intro": "Astragalus faridanicus, commonly known as Faridani alfalfa, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which attract pollinators such as bees. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
