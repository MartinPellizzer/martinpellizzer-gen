    "intro": "Ardernia, commonly known as New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cyperaceae. It consists of several species, including Ardernia tetrandra, which is native to New Zealand. These plants are characterized by their tall, grass-like stems and clusters of small, spike-like flowers. They typically grow in wet, swampy areas and are adapted to the humid climate of their native habitat. The genus plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's wetland ecosystems."
