    "intro": "Aconitum neubergense var. densiflorum, commonly known as the dense-flowered aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple spires of tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with deeply cut lobes, and its stems are typically hairy and stout. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and toxicity, it is often cultivated in gardens but requires careful handling.",
