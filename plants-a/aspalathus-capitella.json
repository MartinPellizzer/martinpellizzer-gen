    "intro": "Aspalathus capitella, commonly known as the small-flowered bushveld pea, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of its branches. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, spherical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland and rocky areas. Aspalathus capitella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
