    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer atropurpureum is primarily native to eastern North America, including the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the Appalachian Mountains and the northeastern regions of the continent. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with mixed hardwood forests. It is known for its striking red foliage in the fall, making it a popular ornamental plant. Its natural range extends from New England to the southeastern United States.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer atropurpureum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its striking fall color and unique foliage. It is commonly found in gardens, parks, and along roadsides in regions with temperate climates. The distribution of this species has expanded beyond its native range in Europe and Asia. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to various urban and suburban environments. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
