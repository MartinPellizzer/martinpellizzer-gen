    "intro": "Alnus formosana, commonly known as the Formosan alder, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, catkin-like flowers followed by cone-like fruits that release wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Alnus formosana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
