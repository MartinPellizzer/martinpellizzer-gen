    "intro": "Anthurium cordatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are velvety to the touch. The plant produces striking spadices, which are modified leaves that enclose the actual flowers. Anthurium cordatum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying properties."
