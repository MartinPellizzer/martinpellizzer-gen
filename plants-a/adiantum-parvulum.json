    "intro": "Adiantum parvulum, commonly known as the small maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that resemble the feathers of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense mat of roots, which help anchor it to rocky or soil substrates. Adiantum parvulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens as a shade-loving plant.",
