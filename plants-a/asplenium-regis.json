    "intro": "Asplenium regis, commonly known as the royal spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Asplenium regis thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate fronds and delicate appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and conservation efforts."
