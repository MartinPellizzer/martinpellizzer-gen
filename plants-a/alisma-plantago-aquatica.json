    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica, commonly known as water plantain, is a semi-aquatic herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and establish in wetland environments. The plant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
