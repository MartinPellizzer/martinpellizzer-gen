    "intro": "Arnica kodiakensis, commonly known as the Alaskan mountain Arnica, is a perennial herb native to the rocky alpine regions of Alaska and northern Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Arnica kodiakensis is known for its medicinal properties, with the roots and flowers containing compounds used in traditional herbal remedies. However, it is considered rare and is protected in many areas due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
