    "intro": "Alnus \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate alder, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between white alder (Alnus rhombifolia) and black alder (Alnus cordata). It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its compound leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in moist, temperate habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization due to its nitrogen-fixing capabilities through root nodules. The wood of Alnus \u00d7 intermedia is lightweight and has been historically used for various crafts and construction purposes."
