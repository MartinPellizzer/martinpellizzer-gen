    "intro": "Andropogon littoralis, commonly known as coastal bluestem, is a grass species native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and maritime hammocks. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fibrous roots help stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Andropogon littoralis plays an important role in coastal ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
