    "intro": "Androcymbium melanthioides var. acaule, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late summer. It has a fibrous root system adapted to poor, sandy soils. This variant is distinguished by its lack of a distinct stem, with the flowers emerging directly from the base of the rosette."
