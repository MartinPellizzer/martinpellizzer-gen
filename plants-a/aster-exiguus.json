It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. Aster exiguus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide nectar for pollinators."
