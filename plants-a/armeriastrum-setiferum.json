    "intro": "Armeriastrum setiferum, commonly known as the woolly sand verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Armeriastrum setiferum is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to withstand arid conditions."
