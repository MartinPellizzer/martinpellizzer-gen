    "intro": "Arnica caespitosa, commonly known as mountain arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a compact, tufted growth habit with dark green, basal leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, tubular flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the genus Arnica. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
