    "intro": "Alloplectus nitidus, commonly known as the smooth alpine lousewort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit and lack of chlorophyll. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized ecological niche, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude environments."
