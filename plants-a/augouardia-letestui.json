It is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically feature a combination of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions with high humidity. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
