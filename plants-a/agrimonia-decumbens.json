    "intro": "Agrimonia decumbens, commonly known as common agrimony, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces dry, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Agrimony has a long history of use in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
