    "intro": "Andropogon perligulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and prairies, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
