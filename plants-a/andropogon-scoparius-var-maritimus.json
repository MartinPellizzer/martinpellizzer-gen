    "intro": "Andropogon scoparius var. maritimus, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are adapted to saline and sandy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences containing numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Saltgrass thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes, marshes, and coastal prairies. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
