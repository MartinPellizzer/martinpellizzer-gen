    "intro": "Astragalus ensifer, commonly known as the swordleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Astragalus ensifer has adapted to harsh environments through its deep root system and ability to fix nitrogen, making it a hardy perennial. Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for various herbivores."
