The plant is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, with a summer rainfall pattern. It is commonly found in coastal and mountainous regions within the Cape Provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthopsis tetragona subsp. tetragona was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. The plant is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites, often thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental transport via human activity. It is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable habitats."
