    "intro": "Aechmea wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's pineapple plant, is a bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with vibrant red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. Its foliage is typically dark green with a waxy texture, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Aechmea wrightii is often used in ornamental horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in indoor conditions."
