    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. breviramusculum, commonly known as the short-leaf red maple, is a variant of the red maple tree characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller leaves. It is native to the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a smooth margin and a vibrant red color in the fall. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes. It produces small, red samaras that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural propagation.",
