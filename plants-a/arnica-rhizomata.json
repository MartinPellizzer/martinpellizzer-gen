    "intro": "Arnica rhizomata, commonly known as mountain tobacco, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes that store nutrients and help the plant survive in harsh alpine environments. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomes contain bioactive compounds like helenalin, which have been used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its ecological importance and medicinal value, it is often found in meadows and rocky soils at high altitudes."
