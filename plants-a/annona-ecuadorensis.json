    "intro": "Annona ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian soursop, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small tree or shrub that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 meters. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit, similar to a soursop, is characterized by its spiky exterior and sweet, creamy flesh. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its edible fruit, which is rich in nutrients."
