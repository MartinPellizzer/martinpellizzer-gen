    "intro": "Asclepias compressidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkweed, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that attract a variety of pollinators, including butterflies and bees. Its milky sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores. The plant plays an important role in supporting the life cycle of the monarch butterfly by providing a host for its larvae."
