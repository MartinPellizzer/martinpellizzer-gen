    "intro": "Ajuga cuneatifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of blue or purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Ajuga cuneatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to prevent soil erosion in wetland habitats."
