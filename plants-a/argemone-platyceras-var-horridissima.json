    "intro": "Argemone platyceras var. horridissima, commonly known as the horrid prickly poppy, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves and is native to regions of Mexico and Central America. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in disturbed soils. Its spiny stems and leaves make it a distinctive and somewhat hazardous plant to handle."
