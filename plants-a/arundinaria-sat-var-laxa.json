It is characterized by its slender, flexible culms that grow in clusters, often reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicle-like inflorescences, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are long and narrow, with a smooth, grass-like texture, and they are arranged alternately along the stem. This species is native to parts of East Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
