    "intro": "Artemisia nivalis, commonly known as snowbrush or alpine wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Artemisia nivalis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for alpine wildlife."
