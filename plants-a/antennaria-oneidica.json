    "intro": "Antennaria oneidica, commonly known as the Oneida sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy soils in the northeastern United States. It has small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It is adapted to harsh, well-drained environments and is often found in open, disturbed areas. Antennaria oneidica plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting local pollinator populations."
