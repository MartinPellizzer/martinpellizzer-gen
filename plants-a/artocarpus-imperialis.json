    "intro": "Artocarpus imperialis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a large, evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters tall, featuring a thick, buttressed trunk and broad, lobed leaves. The tree produces a unique fruit that is typically harvested when green, though it can be cooked or fermented for various culinary uses. Its fruit contains a starchy, edible pulp surrounded by a fibrous rind, and it plays a significant role in traditional agriculture and diets. The plant is also valued for its ornamental value and ecological importance in tropical forests."
