    "intro": "Anacardium amapaense, commonly known as the Amapa Brazil nut tree, is a member of the Anacardiaceae family and is native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a medium to large evergreen tree that can grow up to 25 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, dark green leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing edible seeds, commonly referred to as Brazil nuts. Its botanical significance lies in its unique seed morphology and its role in the ecological and economic systems of the Amazon region."
