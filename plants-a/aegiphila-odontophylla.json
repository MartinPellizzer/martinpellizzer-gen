The plant features small, gray-green leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. It is part of the Verbenaceae family and is often used in xerophytic landscaping due to its drought tolerance. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging soil conditions."
