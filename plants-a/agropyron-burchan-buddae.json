    "intro": "Agropyron burchan-buddae, commonly known as the Tibetan needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, needle-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its resilience, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
