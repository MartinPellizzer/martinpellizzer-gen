    "intro": "Aristolochia pichinchensis, commonly known as the Peruvian Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are often greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are typically green when mature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
