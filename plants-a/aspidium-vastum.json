    "intro": "Aspidium vastum, commonly known as the broad fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often leathery fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and woodland areas. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
