It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lanceolate leaves that have a distinctive cinnamon-like aroma when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsules containing numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
