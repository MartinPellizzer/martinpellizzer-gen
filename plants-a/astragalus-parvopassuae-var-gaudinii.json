    "intro": "Astragalus parvopassuae var. gaudinii, commonly known as the Gaudin's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
