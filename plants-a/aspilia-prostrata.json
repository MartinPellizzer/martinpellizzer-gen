    "intro": "Aspilia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, daisy-like yellow flowers with white centers, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Aspilia prostrata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
