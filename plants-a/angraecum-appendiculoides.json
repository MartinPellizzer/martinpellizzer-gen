    "intro": "Angraecum appendiculoides, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It features long, slender inflorescences with pendulous, white to pale blue flowers that resemble stars, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact, pseudobulbous structure with broad, fleshy leaves that store water, adapted to its arid and seasonal habitat. It blooms during the rainy season, typically between November and March, and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
