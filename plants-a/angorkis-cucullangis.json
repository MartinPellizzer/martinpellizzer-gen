    "intro": "Angorkis cucullangis, commonly known as the hooded angorkis, is a unique flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hood-like petals that encase the reproductive structures, a feature that aids in pollination by specific insect species. The plant has a woody stem with smooth, dark green leaves that are oval in shape. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
