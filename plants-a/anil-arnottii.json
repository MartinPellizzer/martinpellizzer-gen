    "intro": "Anil arnottii, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Anil arnottii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
