    "intro": "Agrostis setacea var. debilis, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 2 mm in width, contributing to its delicate appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
