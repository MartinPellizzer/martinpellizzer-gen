    "intro": "Antirrhinum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered snapdragon, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soil in full sun. Antirrhinum grandiflorum is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow from seed."
