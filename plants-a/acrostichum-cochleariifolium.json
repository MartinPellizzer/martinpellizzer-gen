    "intro": "Acrostichum cochleariifolium, commonly known as the earleaf brake, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Blechnaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often divided into segments with a distinctive ear-like shape. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in the wild.",
