    "intro": "Aeschynanthus longicaulis, commonly known as the long-stemmed gloxinia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces showy bracts that often resemble the flowers themselves, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus longicaulis is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and prolonged blooming period."
