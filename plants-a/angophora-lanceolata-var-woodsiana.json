    "intro": "Angophora lanceolata var. woodsiana, commonly known as the Sydney red gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark that peels in long strips, revealing a red or brown inner bark. The leaves are lanceolate, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, urn-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in yellow or pale green, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
