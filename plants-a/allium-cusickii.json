It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spherical bulbs and flowering stems that bear white to pale pink flowers with six petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
