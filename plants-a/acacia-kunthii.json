    "intro": "Acacia kunthii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and produces yellow globular flowers in spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its seeds are encased in a hard pod and are often used in traditional Aboriginal practices. Acacia kunthii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat.",

This species thrives in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in dry forests and savannas. Acacia kunthii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia kunthii was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas of the southwestern United States, particularly in Arizona and New Mexico. This plant is often used for erosion control due to its deep root system and ability to withstand drought conditions. It has also been introduced to parts of Australia and other regions with similar environmental conditions. Its introduction has sometimes led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in non-native habitats."
