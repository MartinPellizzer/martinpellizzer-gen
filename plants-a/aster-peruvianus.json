    "intro": "Aster peruvianus, commonly known as the Peruvian aster, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Aster peruvianus thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
