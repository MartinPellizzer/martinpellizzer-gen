It thrives in humid, forested environments. The plant is commonly associated with the Atlantic Forest biome. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema levelii was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in Brazil, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil types. It has been widely cultivated in regions with warm climates, including parts of Argentina and Paraguay. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it has shown some invasive tendencies in certain areas, raising concerns about its ecological impact. The plant prefers full sun to partial shade and thrives in well-drained soils. Its introduction has led to discussions about its role in local ecosystems and the need for careful management."
