    "intro": "Athyrium protensum, commonly known as the slender male fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a layer of brown, hairy tissue. Its sori are arranged in a single row along the margins of the pinnae, and the spores are released during the autumn months. Athyrium protensum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
