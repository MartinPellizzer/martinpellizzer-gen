    "intro": "Athyrium crenulatoserrulatum f. hakonense, commonly known as the Hakonese Japanese Painted Fern, is a varietal form of the Japanese painted fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically a mix of green and silver-white in color. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular ornamental in shaded garden settings. This fern is native to Japan and is valued for its delicate, aesthetic appearance."
