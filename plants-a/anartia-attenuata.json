    "intro": "Anartia attenuata, commonly known as the Brazilian swallowtail butterfly's host plant, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic, compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Anartia attenuata plays a crucial role in supporting the life cycle of the Anartia jutta butterfly, serving as both a food source and a site for egg-laying."
