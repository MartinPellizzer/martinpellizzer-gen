    "intro": "Aquilegia incurvata, commonly known as the bent-flowered columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple, with five petals that curve inward. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and it produces seed pods that split open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Aquilegia incurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
