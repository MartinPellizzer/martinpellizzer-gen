    "intro": "Athyrium muricatum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its common name. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns."
