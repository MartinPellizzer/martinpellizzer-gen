    "intro": "Aspidium pennigerum, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular, and often deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium pennigerum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental foliage in horticulture."
