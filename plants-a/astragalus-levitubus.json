    "intro": "Astragalus levitubus, commonly known as the Levitubus milkvetch, is a member of the legume family Fabaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by pods containing kidney-shaped seeds. Native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, it is adapted to dry, sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
