    "intro": "Athyriopsis hunanensis, commonly known as the Hunan Athyriopsis, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
