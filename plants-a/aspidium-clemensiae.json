    "intro": "Aspidium clemensiae, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a species of fern native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in forest understories. Its rhizomes are wiry and can form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to spread vegetatively. The spore-bearing structures, or soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a key feature in its reproductive biology."
