    "intro": "Asarum caudatum, commonly known as the trailing asarum or Indian snakeroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a hairy texture and emits a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Asarum caudatum has historical use in traditional medicine but is now primarily valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
