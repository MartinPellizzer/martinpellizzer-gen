    "intro": "Anemone parviflora var. genuina, commonly known as the small-flowered anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features upright stems with palmately divided, deeply lobed leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces clusters of delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central yellow stigma, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring emergence and long-lasting blooms."
