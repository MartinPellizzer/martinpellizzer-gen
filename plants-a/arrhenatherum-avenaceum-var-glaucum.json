    "intro": "Arrhenatherum avenaceum var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray hue due to the presence of a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are usually pale green to brown in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
