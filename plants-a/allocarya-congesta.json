    "intro": "Allocarya congesta, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. Its flowers are usually borne on elongated stems and bloom in late spring to early summer. Allocarya congesta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
