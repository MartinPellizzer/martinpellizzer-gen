    "intro": "Artemisia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of narrow, aromatic leaves with a strong, camphor-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in dense spherical shapes, typical of the Artemisia genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes. Due to its adaptability and medicinal properties, it has been used in traditional herbal remedies for various ailments."
