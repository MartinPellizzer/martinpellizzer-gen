    "intro": "Aniba elliptica, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features smooth, dark grey bark and elliptical, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. The plant produces small, fragrant yellowish-white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
