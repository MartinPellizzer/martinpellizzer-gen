    "intro": "Aristotelia glabra, commonly known as the silver mint or silver leaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-white, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, round drupe that turns red when mature. Aristotelia glabra is often found in damp, shaded environments such as forest understoreys and along stream banks."
