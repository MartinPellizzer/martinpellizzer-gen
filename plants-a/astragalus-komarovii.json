It is characterized by its spiny stems and compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters, which are followed by narrow, pod-like fruits containing seeds. Astragalus komarovii is adapted to harsh environments, exhibiting deep root systems and drought tolerance. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
