    "intro": "Aeschynomene paludicola, commonly known as swamp sesban, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in wet or marshy environments. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are alternate and ovate. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This characteristic makes it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
