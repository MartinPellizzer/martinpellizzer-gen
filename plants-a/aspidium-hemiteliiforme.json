    "intro": "Aspidium hemiteliiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. Aspidium hemiteliiforme is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of understory vegetation."
