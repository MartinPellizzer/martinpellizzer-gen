    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus subsp. borealis, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that often forms dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic environments. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
