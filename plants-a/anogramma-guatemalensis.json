    "intro": "Anogramma guatemalensis, commonly known as the Guatemalan maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. Native to the humid tropical regions of Central America, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has small, spore-producing structures called sorangia on the underside of its fronds. Anogramma guatemalensis is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in montane forests."
