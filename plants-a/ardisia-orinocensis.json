    "intro": "Ardisia orinocensis, commonly known as the Orinoco ardisia, is a species of flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in the Orinoco River basin. It belongs to the family Myrsinaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. Ardisia orinocensis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively uncommon outside its native range."
