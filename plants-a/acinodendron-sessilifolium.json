    "intro": "Acinodendron sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaf acinodendron, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important species. The plant is characterized by its simple, sessile leaves that are often arranged in whorls along the stems. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research.",
