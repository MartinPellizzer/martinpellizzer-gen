    "intro": "Arenaria karakorensis, commonly known as Karakoram sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Karakoram mountain range. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often found in crevices and on slopes where the soil is thin and the climate is harsh. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rocky habitat. Its leaves are typically succulent, helping it conserve water in the arid conditions of its native environment. Arenaria karakorensis plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its high-altitude ecosystem."
