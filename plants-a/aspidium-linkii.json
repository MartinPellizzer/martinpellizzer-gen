    "intro": "Aspidium linkii, commonly known as the link's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern found in freshwater habitats. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with long, creeping stems that root at the nodes. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, ovate pinnae that provide a lush, green appearance. Aspidium linkii is well adapted to slow-moving or still water, where it can thrive in shaded conditions."
