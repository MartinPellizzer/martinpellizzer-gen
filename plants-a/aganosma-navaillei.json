    "intro": "Aganosma navaillei, commonly known as the Navaille's aganosma, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and glossy leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, where it relies on high humidity and partial light. Its botanical features include elongated, opposite leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Aganosma navaillei is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
