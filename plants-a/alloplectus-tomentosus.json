    "intro": "Alloplectus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and leaves that are typically submerged in water. The plant is native to freshwater habitats in North America, particularly in the eastern United States. It possesses specialized structures called bladders, which it uses to trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Alloplectus tomentosus is a carnivorous plant, adapting to nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
