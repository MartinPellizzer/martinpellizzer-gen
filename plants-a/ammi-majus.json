    "intro": "Ammi majus, commonly known as greater cow-wheat, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces seeds enclosed in a distinctive, inflated fruit called a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Ammi majus is also known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
