    "intro": "Aloe bourea, commonly known as the Cape aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Aloe bourea is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its leaves can be used to extract gel, which has been traditionally used for its soothing properties."
