    "intro": "Aspidium phaeocaulon, commonly known as the black-stemmed water fern, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically divided into smaller, lance-shaped segments. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a structure typical of many ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in wetlands. Aspidium phaeocaulon is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive foliage."
