    "intro": "Agrostis lachnantha var. glabra, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and a dense, mat-like growth habit. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and wet meadows. Its smooth, hairless leaves distinguish it from other varieties within the Agrostis genus."
