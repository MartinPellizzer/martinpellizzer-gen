    "intro": "Adelocaryum lambertianum, commonly known as the Lambert's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its striking, pale purple flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees rather than in soil, and relies on specific humidity and light conditions for survival. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Due to its rarity, it is considered a conservation priority and is often protected in its native regions.",
