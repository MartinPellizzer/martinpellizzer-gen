    "intro": "Aspidium patens var. pilosulum, commonly known as the hairy broad fern, is a terrestrial fern native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its spreading rhizome and fronds that are typically divided into linear segments. The fronds are often covered in fine, silky hairs, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori along the veins."
