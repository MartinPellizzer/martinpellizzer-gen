    "intro": "Alisma sprengelii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and stream edges. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are often floating or submersed, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in spikes and bloom during the summer months. Alisma sprengelii is valued for its role in wetland ecosystems and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
