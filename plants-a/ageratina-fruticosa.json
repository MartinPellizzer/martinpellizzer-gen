    "intro": "Ageratina fruticosa, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to blueish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall, creating a mist-like appearance. Its foliage is often covered in fine, silky hairs, which contribute to its distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. Ageratina fruticosa is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
