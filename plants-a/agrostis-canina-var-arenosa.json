    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. arenosa, commonly known as sand couchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to sandy and coastal regions. It typically grows in open, dry habitats such as dunes and coastal plains, where it forms dense, low-growing vegetation. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and establish itself in disturbed or sandy soils. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
