    "intro": "Alchemilla aequidens, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
