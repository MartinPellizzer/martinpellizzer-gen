    "intro": "Anchusa undulata var. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers and silver-gray, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its fibrous root system stabilizes sandy soils, making it an important species for coastal erosion control. Anchusa undulata var. maritima is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens and its historical use in traditional medicine."
