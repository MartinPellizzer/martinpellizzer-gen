    "intro": "Anthurium \u00d7 cultorum, commonly known as the flamingo flower, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Araceae family. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful spathe that resembles a flower, though it is actually a modified leaf. The plant produces a spadix, which is the true flowering structure, covered in tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires indirect light for optimal growth. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in both indoor and outdoor settings."
