The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, giving it its common name. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon hookeri plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
