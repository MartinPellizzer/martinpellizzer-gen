    "intro": "Alopecurus foliosus, commonly known as slender mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Alopecurus foliosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
