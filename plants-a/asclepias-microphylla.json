    "intro": "Asclepias microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Asclepias microphylla is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, providing essential nutrition for their development. Its latex sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals but serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
