    "intro": "Acacia gonocarpa, commonly known as the African wattle, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia gonocarpa is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in soil enrichment.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia gonocarpa is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to the harsh climate of the region. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is closely linked to the environmental conditions of the northern Australian landscape.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia gonocarpa was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, particularly in the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned farmland. It is valued for its hardy nature and ability to withstand drought conditions. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
