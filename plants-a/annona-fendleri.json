    "intro": "Annona fendleri, commonly known as the Mexican custard apple, is a tropical plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub that can grow up to 6 meters tall, with thick, waxy leaves that are alternate and elliptical in shape. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a rough, green to yellowish berry that ripens in the fall and is known for its sweet, custard-like flavor. Annona fendleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though it requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
