    "intro": "Aporum hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing both male and female spores on the same plant. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
