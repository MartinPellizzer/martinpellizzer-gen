    "intro": "Alchemilla oxysepala, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are silver-gray in color due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, arranged in loose clusters atop slender stalks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties. Alchemilla oxysepala thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats."
