    "intro": "Avicennia tomentosa var. guayaquilensis, commonly known as the Guayaquil mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to saline and brackish water environments. It possesses aerial roots that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils, and its leaves are covered in a dense, whitish layer of fine hairs, which reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pollinated by insects, and its woody fruits contain buoyant seeds that aid in coastal dispersal. This species plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
