    "intro": "Ampacus viticina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
