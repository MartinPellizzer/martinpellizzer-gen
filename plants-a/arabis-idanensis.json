    "intro": "Arabis idanensis, commonly known as the Idanensis rockcress, is a flowering plant species native to the Middle East and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops and wild plants. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
