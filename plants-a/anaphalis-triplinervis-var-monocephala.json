    "intro": "Anaphalis triplinervis var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed willow herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flower heads consist of numerous small, yellowish to white florets, arranged in a single, rounded cluster at the top of the stem."
