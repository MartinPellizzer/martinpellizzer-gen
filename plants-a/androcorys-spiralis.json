    "intro": "Androcorys spiralis, commonly known as the spiral tamarisk, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Androcorys spiralis thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it well adapted to drought conditions and high temperatures."
