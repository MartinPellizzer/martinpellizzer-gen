    "intro": "Andropogon brownii, commonly known as brown bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it ecologically important in wetland ecosystems. Brown bluestem is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate periodic flooding."
