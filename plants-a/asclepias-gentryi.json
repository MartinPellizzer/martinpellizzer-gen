    "intro": "Asclepias gentryi, commonly known as Gentry's milkweed, is a rare and endangered species native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers with distinctive hooded petals. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is a critical host plant for the larvae of the monarch butterfly. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are essential to preserve this unique botanical species."
