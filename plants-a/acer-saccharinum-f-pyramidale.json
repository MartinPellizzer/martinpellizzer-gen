    "intro": "Acer saccharinum f. pyramidale, commonly known as the silver maple cultivar 'Pyramidale', is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its narrow, columnar growth habit. It features finely dissected, silvery-white leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding seasonal interest. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its compact form makes it suitable for small spaces, and it is often used in urban landscapes. The cultivar is known for its fast growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",
