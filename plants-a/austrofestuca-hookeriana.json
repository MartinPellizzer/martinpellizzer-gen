    "intro": "Austrofestuca hookeriana, commonly known as Hooker's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Austrofestuca hookeriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
