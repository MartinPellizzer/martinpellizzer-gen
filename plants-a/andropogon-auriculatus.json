    "intro": "Andropogon auriculatus, commonly known as the ear-shaped grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base on the leaf sheaths. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands, prairies, and along stream banks. Andropogon auriculatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
