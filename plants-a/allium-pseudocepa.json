    "intro": "Allium pseudocepa, commonly known as leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its hollow, cylindrical, and tender leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces a cluster of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in the summer. Its bulb, which is the edible part, is typically harvested before the plant flowers. Allium pseudocepa is valued for its mild, onion-like flavor and is widely used in culinary applications."
