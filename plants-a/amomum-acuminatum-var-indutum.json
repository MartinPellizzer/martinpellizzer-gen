It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, finger-like rhizomes that are used in traditional medicine and as a spice. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to white flowers followed by dark purple berries. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered with a fine, hairy texture, which gives it its common name.
