It is characterized by its tuberous roots and compact, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside of its native region."
