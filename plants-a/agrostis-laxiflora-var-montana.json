    "intro": "Agrostis laxiflora var. montana, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose cluster of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in natural habitats."
