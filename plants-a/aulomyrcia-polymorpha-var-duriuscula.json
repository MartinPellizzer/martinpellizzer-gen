    "intro": "Aulomyrcia polymorpha var. duriuscula, commonly known as the thick-leaved hibiscus, is a tropical shrub characterized by its robust, woody stems and thick, leathery leaves. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to Central and South America. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variant is distinguished by its more rugged, textured foliage compared to other varieties of Aulomyrcia."
