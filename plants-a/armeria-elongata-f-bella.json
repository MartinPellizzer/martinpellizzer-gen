    "intro": "[WRONG START] Armeria elongata f. Bella, commonly known as the Showy Sea Thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in maritime climates."
