It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus shepardii is often found in sagebrush steppe and is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
