    "intro": "Alnus hirsuta var. sibirica, commonly known as the Siberian alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the cold regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely toothed, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, round nuts that mature in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or along riverbanks. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
