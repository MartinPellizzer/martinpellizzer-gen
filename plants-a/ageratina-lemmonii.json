    "intro": "Ageratina lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fluffy, blue-gray inflorescences that resemble a misty cloud, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in desert regions. It has small, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Ageratina lemmonii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
