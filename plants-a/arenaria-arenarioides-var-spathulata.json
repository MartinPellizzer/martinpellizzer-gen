It typically features dense clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are generally broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in extreme climates."
