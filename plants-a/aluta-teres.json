    "intro": "Aluta teres, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that split open when mature, releasing the seeds to the wind. Aluta teres is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
