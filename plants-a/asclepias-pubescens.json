    "intro": "Asclepias pubescens, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces seed pods that split open to release tiny seeds with silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias pubescens is a critical host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, supporting their life cycle. Its adaptations to arid environments include deep root systems and water-storing tissues."
