It typically grows along the banks of rivers and streams, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and aesthetic appeal."
