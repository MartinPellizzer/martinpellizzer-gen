    "intro": "Alsophila tenggerensis, commonly known as the Tengger bamboo fern, is a species of tree fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a robust root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. This unique botanical feature makes it a subject of interest in both ecological and horticultural studies."
