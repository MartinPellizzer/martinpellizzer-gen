    "intro": "Asplenium abscissum, commonly known as the cut fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a rosette formation. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Asplenium abscissum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care."
