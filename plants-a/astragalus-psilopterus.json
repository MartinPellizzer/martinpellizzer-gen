    "intro": "Astragalus psilopterus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland ecosystems. Astragalus psilopterus plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to withstand arid conditions."
