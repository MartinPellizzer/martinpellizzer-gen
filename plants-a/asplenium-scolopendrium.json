    "intro": "Asplenium scolopendrium, commonly known as the hart's-tongue fern, is a perennial fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, and evergreen fronds that remain upright throughout the year. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Asplenium scolopendrium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
