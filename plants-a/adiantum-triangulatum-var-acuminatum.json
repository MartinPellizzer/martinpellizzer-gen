    "intro": "Adiantum triangulatum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy, with a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, moist soil to flourish. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
