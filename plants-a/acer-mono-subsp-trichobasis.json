    "intro": "Acer mono subsp. trichobasis, commonly known as the trichobasis maple, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with compact branching and a dense canopy. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern.",
