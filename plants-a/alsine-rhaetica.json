    "intro": "Alsine rhaetica, commonly known as Rhaetic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant typically has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, white or pink flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Alsine rhaetica is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
