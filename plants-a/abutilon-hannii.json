    "intro": "Abutilon hannii, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters in height, characterized by its velvety, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a soft, downy texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon hannii is primarily native to Queensland. It is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the state. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and lowland rainforests. It thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. Its native distribution is limited to specific habitats within Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon hannii was mainly introduced to the eastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It has been reported in several states including Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. This plant is commonly found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, abandoned fields, and wetlands. It has been classified as an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through accidental dispersal via contaminated soil or seeds."
