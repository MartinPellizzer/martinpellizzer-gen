    "intro": "Astragalus trichocalyx, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring upright stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus trichocalyx is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
