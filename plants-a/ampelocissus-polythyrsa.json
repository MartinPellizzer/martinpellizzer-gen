    "intro": "Ampelocissus polythyrsa, commonly known as the African fig-leaf vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
