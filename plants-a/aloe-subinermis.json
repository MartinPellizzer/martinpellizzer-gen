    "intro": "Aloe subinermis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, covered in a layer of white powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on tall, branching stems. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe subinermis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions."
