It is characterized by its slender, upright rhizome and a cluster of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in a spadix, which is surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Anthericum caulescens is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and along stream banks."
