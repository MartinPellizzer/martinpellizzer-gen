    "intro": "Allium elatum, commonly known as the giant garlic or mountain leek, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of pale purple or white, bell-shaped flowers at the top of the stem, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are long, narrow, and grass-like, typically forming a dense rosette at the base. Allium elatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
