    "intro": "Acrostichum tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy fern or the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy texture on the fronds, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a feathery appearance that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid climates.",
