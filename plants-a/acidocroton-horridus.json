It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in small, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and visually striking member of the Euphorbiaceae family.",
