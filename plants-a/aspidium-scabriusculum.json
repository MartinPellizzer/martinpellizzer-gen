    "intro": "Aspidium scabriusculum, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and forest floors. Its rhizomes are wiry and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly across the ground. The sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of many fern species."
