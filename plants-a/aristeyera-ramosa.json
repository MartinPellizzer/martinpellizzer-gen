    "intro": "Aristeyera ramosa, commonly known as the hairy stickleaf, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems covered in fine, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to drought conditions and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
