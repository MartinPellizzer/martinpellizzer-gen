    "intro": "Acanthus spinosus, commonly known as the spiny acanthus, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with prominent veins and its showy, spires of purple or pink flowers. The plant features robust, woody stems and produces distinctive, spiny bracts that protect its inflorescences. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in garden designs for its architectural form and visual impact. Acanthus spinosus is also valued in horticulture for its historical association with classical art and architecture.",

This plant is commonly found in rocky coastal areas and cliffs along the Mediterranean coast. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with maritime climates. Acanthus spinosus is known for its ornate foliage and is often used in ornamental horticulture. Its native range spans parts of southeastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus spinosus was mainly introduced to Algeria, Great Britain, Ireland, New South Wales, and Victoria. It was likely brought to these regions for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and flowers. The plant has established itself in some of these areas, sometimes becoming invasive in local ecosystems. Its introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native plant communities. Efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread in regions where it is not native."
