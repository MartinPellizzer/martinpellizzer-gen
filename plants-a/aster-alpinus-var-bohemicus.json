It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to add color to high-altitude gardens."
