    "intro": "Aster papposus, commonly known as the western aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Aster papposus is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
