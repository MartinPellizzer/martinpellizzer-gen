    "intro": "Atriplex muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's saltbush, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a common species in coastal and inland saltbush communities. Atriplex muelleri plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native animals."
