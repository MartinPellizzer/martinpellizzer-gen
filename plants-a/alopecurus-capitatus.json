    "intro": "Alopecurus capitatus, commonly known as the mouse-ear chickweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed soils. Alopecurus capitatus is often found in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
