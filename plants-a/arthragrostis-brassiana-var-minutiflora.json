    "intro": "Arthragrostis brassiana var. minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
