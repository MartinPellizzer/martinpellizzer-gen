    "intro": "Asplenium erectum f. lagesiana, commonly known as the Lagesian spleenwort, is a fern species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive linear pattern along the margins of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
