    "intro": "Androsace montana, commonly known as the alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense clusters of tiny, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in rocky habitats. Androsace montana is often found in meadows, scree slopes, and subalpine zones where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
