    "intro": "Anagallis monelli var. maritima, commonly known as the seaside purslane, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and the western coast of the United States. It is a low-growing annual herb with succulent, fleshy leaves and small, vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salty, windy environments. Its stems and leaves are often covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is also known for its ability to self-pollinate and spread rapidly in disturbed habitats."
