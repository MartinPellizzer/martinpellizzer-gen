    "intro": "Antennaria hygrophila, commonly known as the marsh willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has slender, hairy stems and produces small white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in damp conditions. Antennaria hygrophila plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats and provides habitat for various insects and small animals."
