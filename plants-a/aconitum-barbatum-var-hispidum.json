    "intro": "Aconitum barbatum var. hispidum, commonly known as the hispid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its \"hispid\" variety name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade in woodland or garden settings. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas with small children or pets.",
