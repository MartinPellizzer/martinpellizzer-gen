    "intro": "Aristolochia cruenta, commonly known as the purple swallow-wort, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and striking, fragrant, purple flowers that resemble a bird's nest. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
