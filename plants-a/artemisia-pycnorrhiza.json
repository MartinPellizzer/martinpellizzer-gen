    "intro": "Artemisia pycnorrhiza, commonly known as Indian wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Artemisia pycnorrhiza is also valued for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
