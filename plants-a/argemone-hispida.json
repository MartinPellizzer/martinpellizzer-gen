    "intro": "Argemone hispida, commonly known as the rough argemone, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it can be invasive in certain regions and may have toxic properties in its seeds."
