    "intro": "Asplenium anogrammoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in temperate regions. Its rhizomes are short and clustered, contributing to its ability to form dense mats. The spores are produced in tiny, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many fern species."
