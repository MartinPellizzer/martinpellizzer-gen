    "intro": "Aspidium mucronifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are pinnately divided, with small, ovate pinnae that have a rounded or blunt tip, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in ponds and ditches. The plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
