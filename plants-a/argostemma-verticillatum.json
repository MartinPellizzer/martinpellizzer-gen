It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
