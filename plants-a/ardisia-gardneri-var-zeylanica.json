It is native to Sri Lanka and is characterized by its glossy, dark green elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
