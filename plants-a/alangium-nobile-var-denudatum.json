It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical or ovate in shape. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. The botanical interest of this variant lies in its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitats."
