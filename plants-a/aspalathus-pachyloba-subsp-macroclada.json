    "intro": "Aspalathus pachyloba subsp. macroclada, commonly known as the large-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, leathery, ovate leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a distinctive member of the Fabaceae family. Although not commercially cultivated like the more common Aspalathus linearis, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its ecological and potential medicinal significance."
