    "intro": "Astragalus persimilis, commonly known as the Persian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppe and semi-desert regions. Astragalus persimilis is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
