    "intro": "Acoridium anfractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Alismataceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that grow from a rhizomatous stem. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Acoridium anfractum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates.",
