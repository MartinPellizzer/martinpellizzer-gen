    "intro": "Arctostaphylos peninsularis subsp. juarezensis, commonly known as the Ju\u00e1rez's manzanita, is a shrub native to the Baja California Peninsula. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with small, leathery leaves that are typically red to dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in white or pale pink during the spring. These flowers give way to edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native region."
