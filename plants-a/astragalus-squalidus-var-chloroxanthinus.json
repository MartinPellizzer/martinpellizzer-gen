    "intro": "Astragalus squalidus var. chloroxanthinus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that often grow close to the ground, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are characteristic of the Fabaceae family. Its leaves are typically compound, consisting of several small, oval-shaped leaflets. This variant is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
