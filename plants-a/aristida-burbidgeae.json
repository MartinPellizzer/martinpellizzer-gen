    "intro": "Aristida burbidgeae, commonly known as the Burbridge's threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Aristida burbidgeae is often found in grasslands and along rocky slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
