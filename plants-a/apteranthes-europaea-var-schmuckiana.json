The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of ecological systems in its native habitat."
