    "intro": "Aristolochia maxima, commonly known as the giant Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers that are highly specialized for pollination by specific insects. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds attached to silky hairs. The plant contains various bioactive compounds and has been used in traditional medicine, though it is also toxic."
