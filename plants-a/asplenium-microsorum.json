    "intro": "Asplenium microsorum, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in groups. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Asplenium microsorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded gardens."
