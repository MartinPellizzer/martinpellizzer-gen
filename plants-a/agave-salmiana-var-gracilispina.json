It features a thick, rosette-shaped stem covered in sharp, spiny leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with white or pale yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
