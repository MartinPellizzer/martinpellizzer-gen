    "intro": "Adenium speciosum, commonly known as the desert candle, is a striking plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its thick, fleshy trunk and vividly colored flowers. The plant's unique morphology includes a swollen base that stores water, enabling it to survive in drought conditions. Its flowers, which can be red, pink, or yellow, bloom during the rainy season. Adenium speciosum is also notable for its toxic sap, which contains cardiac glycosides and is used in traditional medicine and as a poison in some cultures.",
