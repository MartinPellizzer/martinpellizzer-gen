    "intro": "Allium gulczense, commonly known as the Polish garlic, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus. It is characterized by its bulbous structure, which is typically smaller than that of common garlic varieties. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe, particularly Poland, where it grows in moist, temperate habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium gulczense is considered a botanically interesting but endangered species."
