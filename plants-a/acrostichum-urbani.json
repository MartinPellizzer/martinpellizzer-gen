    "intro": "Acrostichum urbani, commonly known as the urban fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that resemble those of other ferns in the family Polypodiaceae. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Acrostichum urbani is considered a species of conservation concern.",
