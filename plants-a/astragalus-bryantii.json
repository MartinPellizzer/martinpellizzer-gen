It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Bryant's milkvetch is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
