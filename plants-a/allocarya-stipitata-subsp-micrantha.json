    "intro": "Allocarya stipitata subsp. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with compact, mat-forming growth habit, typically reaching heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, aiding in water conservation. Its flowers are pink to purple in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom during the spring and early summer. It is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats."
