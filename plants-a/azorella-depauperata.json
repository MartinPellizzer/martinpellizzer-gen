    "intro": "Azorella depauperata, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the high Andes of Chile and is adapted to grow in harsh, cold, and arid environments. The plant forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed rosettes of foliage. Its leaves are small, waxy, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Azorella depauperata is known for its slow growth and ability to survive in extreme conditions, making it a notable example of alpine flora."
