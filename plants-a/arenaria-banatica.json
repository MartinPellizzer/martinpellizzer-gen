    "intro": "Arenaria banatica, commonly known as the Balkan sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It thrives in rocky, arid, or sandy soils, often found in mountainous regions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Arenaria banatica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
