It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in wet or moist environments, such as stream banks and wetlands. The leaves are lance-shaped with a pointed tip, giving it its common name, and they are usually alternate along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical seed clusters that disperse via wind. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
