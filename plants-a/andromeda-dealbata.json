    "intro": "Andromeda dealbata, commonly known as the silverleaf andromeda, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. Its leaves are elliptical and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, giving it its common name. Andromeda dealbata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
