    "intro": "Arenaria cerastioides, commonly known as sandstone flower or coastal sandplant, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
