    "intro": "Atriplex nitens subsp. desertorum, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its succulent leaves and small, greenish-gray flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Its leaves contain high levels of salts and oxalates, which help it retain water and deter herbivores. This species plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
