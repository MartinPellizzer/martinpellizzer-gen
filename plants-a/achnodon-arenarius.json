    "intro": "Achnodon arenarius, commonly known as the sand sparrowgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Achnodon arenarius is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and gravel plains.",
