    "intro": "Aspidium andaiense, commonly known as the Andean water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to South America. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium andaiense plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
