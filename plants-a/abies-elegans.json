    "intro": "Abies elegans, commonly known as the white fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and its silver-blue foliage, which is dense and needle-like. The tree produces cones that are typically 5 to 8 centimeters long, containing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its bark is smooth and gray when young, becoming furrowed with age. Abies elegans thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies elegans is primarily native to the western United States and parts of southern Canada. It is found in regions such as California, Oregon, and Washington. This species typically grows in high elevation areas, including mountainous forests and subalpine zones. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed coniferous forests. Abies elegans is an important component of the ecological systems in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies elegans was mainly introduced to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is commonly found in high elevation areas with moist, well-drained soils. This species is often planted in urban landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in cooler climates. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly. Its distribution has expanded due to both natural spread and human activity."
