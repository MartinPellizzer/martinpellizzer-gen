These shrubs are native to the eastern and southeastern United States, where they thrive in acidic, well-drained soils. They are characterized by their small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture. Actispermum species are often used in native plant gardens for their ornamental value and ecological benefits."
