    "intro": "Aleuritia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf elderberry, is a small shrub native to eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet and features opposite, elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple berries in the fall. These berries are edible and often used in jams and wines. Aleuritia pusilla is adapted to moist, woodland habitats and is relatively hardy in various soil conditions."
