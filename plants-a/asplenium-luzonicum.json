    "intro": "Asplenium luzonicum, commonly known as the Luzon shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense clusters on rocky or shaded forest floors. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and colonize suitable habitats effectively. The fronds are divided into small, shield-shaped segments, giving the plant its common name and contributing to its ornamental appeal."
