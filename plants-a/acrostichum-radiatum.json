    "intro": "Acrostichum radiatum, commonly known as the giant reed or common reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It has long, slender, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in height, with a dense, fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spike-like clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomes are often used in basket weaving and as a natural fiber. Acrostichum radiatum plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
