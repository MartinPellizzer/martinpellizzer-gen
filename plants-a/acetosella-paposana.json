    "intro": "Acetosella paposana, commonly known as the pink-scented sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart flavor, and it is sometimes used in herbal teas. Acetosella paposana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators.",
