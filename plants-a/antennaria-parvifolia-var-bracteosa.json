    "intro": "Antennaria parvifolia var. bracteosa, commonly known as the bracted mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has hairy, creeping stems that form dense mats, and its leaves are spoon-shaped with a hairy surface. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine meadows. The variety bracteosa is distinguished by the presence of bracts beneath the flowers, which are modified leaves."
