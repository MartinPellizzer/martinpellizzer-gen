    "intro": "Anogeissus rivularis, commonly known as the river teak or small teak, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark and elliptical leaves that are usually glossy green on the upper surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in tropical and subtropical regions. Anogeissus rivularis is valued for its durable wood, which is used in furniture and construction."
