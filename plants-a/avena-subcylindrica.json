    "intro": "Avena subcylindrica, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are typically less than 30 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences containing both male and female flowers, typical of the grass family. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, bract-like structures, which help in seed dispersal. Avena subcylindrica is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
