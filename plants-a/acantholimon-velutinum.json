    "intro": "Acantholimon velutinum, commonly known as the velvet flax, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers in spring. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name. Acantholimon velutinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon velutinum is primarily native to Tadzhikistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the Pamir and Alay mountain ranges. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. It is well adapted to the cold and dry climate of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Tadzhikistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon velutinum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in regions with moderate to high levels of sunlight and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is typically associated with Mediterranean climates but has been introduced to other regions with similar environmental conditions. It is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and prevent erosion. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native plant species in non-native ranges."
