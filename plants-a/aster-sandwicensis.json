    "intro": "Aster sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian aster, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. This species is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, Aster sandwicensis is considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts in Hawaii."
