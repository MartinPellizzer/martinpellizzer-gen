    "intro": "Allium crystallinum, commonly known as the crystal garlic or rock garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant is notable for its unique, garlic-like aroma and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its bulbous stems are often covered in a crystalline coating, which gives it its common name. Allium crystallinum is valued in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
