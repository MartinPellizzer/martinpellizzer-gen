    "intro": "Asplenium pseudonitidum var. ovalescens, commonly known as the oval-leaf rock fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
