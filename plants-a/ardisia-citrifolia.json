    "intro": "Ardisia citrifolia, commonly known as the Christmas berry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It features glossy, dark green elliptical leaves and produces small, red, fleshy berries that resemble citrus fruits, hence its common name. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and colorful fruit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates. The berries are edible but not commonly consumed due to their tart flavor and potential toxicity in large quantities."
