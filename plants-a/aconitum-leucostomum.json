    "intro": "Aconitum leucostomum, commonly known as the white-flowered monkshood, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features tall, spire-like stems that bear dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers with a hooded structure, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. However, all parts of the plant are highly toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.",
