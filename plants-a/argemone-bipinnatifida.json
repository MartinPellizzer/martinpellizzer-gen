    "intro": "Argemone bipinnatifida, commonly known as the double-leaf argemone, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bipinnatifid leaves, which are deeply divided into two sets of smaller lobes. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
