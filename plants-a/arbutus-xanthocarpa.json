    "intro": "Arbutus xanthocarpa, commonly known as the yellow madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-bark that peels in thin, papery strips, and its clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, yellow-orange berries that are edible for birds but generally unpalatable to humans. Its leaves are alternate, leathery, and turn bright red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Arbutus xanthocarpa is adapted to coastal climates and thrives in well-drained soils."
