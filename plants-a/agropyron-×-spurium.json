    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 spurium, commonly known as the wheatgrass or intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species belonging to the Poaceae family. It is a sterile, triploid hybrid resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass) and Agropyron elongatum (tall wheatgrass). This plant is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, grass-like foliage, often growing in open, semi-arid environments. It is known for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, making it valuable for erosion control and forage production. Its botanical features make it a key species in ecological restoration and agricultural systems."
