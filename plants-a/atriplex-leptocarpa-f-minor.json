    "intro": "Atriplex leptocarpa f. minor, commonly known as the narrowleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and coastal dunes. Its hardy nature makes it an important species for stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
