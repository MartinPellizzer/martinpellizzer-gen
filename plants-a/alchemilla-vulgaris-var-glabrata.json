    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. glabrata, commonly known as smooth lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, glabrous (hairless) leaves that are often covered in a whitish waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological gardens and traditional herbal medicine."
