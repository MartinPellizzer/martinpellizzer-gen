    "intro": "Adenanthos cygnorum subsp. cygnorum, commonly known as the Grey Box, is a small to medium-sized shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its grey-green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white to grey pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the autumn season, which are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodland and heathland environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity.",
