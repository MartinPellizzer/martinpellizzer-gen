    "intro": "Aldrovanda generalis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a small, aquatic carnivorous plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves, each leaf ending in a sticky, snapping trap that captures small aquatic insects. The plant's rapid closing mechanism is triggered by touch, allowing it to trap prey efficiently. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in nutrient-poor conditions. Its unique morphology and specialized trapping mechanism make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
