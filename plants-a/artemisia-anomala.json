    "intro": "Artemisia anomala, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, hairy glands that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Artemisia anomala is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
