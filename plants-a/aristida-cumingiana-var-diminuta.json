    "intro": "Aristida cumingiana var. diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf threeawn, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces fine, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, a common adaptation in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
