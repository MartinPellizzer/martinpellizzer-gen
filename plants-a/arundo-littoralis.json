    "intro": "Arundo littoralis, commonly known as coastal arundo, is a tall, perennial grass native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often growing along shorelines and estuaries. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense stands that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Arundo littoralis is valued for its ecological role in coastal habitats and its use in traditional landscaping."
