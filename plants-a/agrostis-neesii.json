    "intro": "Agrostis neesii, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that often reach heights of 30 to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Agrostis neesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
