    "intro": "Artemisia klementzae, commonly known as Klementza's wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiparasitic effects."
