It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces showy, violet-colored blooms during the wet season. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
