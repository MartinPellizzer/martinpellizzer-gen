    "intro": "Arenaria macrorrhiza, commonly known as sand pink, is a low-growing flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces showy, pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria macrorrhiza is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
