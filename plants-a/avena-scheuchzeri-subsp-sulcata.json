    "intro": "Avena scheuchzeri subsp. sulcata, commonly known as the Alpine oat, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
