    "intro": "Acacia asepala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are often arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Acacia asepala is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. It plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia asepala is primarily native to Western Australia. It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in coastal and inland regions, often growing in shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Acacia asepala plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia asepala was mainly introduced to areas with dry and semi-arid climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. Its introduction has been associated with both ecological benefits and potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Due to its adaptability, it has been planted in reclamation projects and as a windbreak in agricultural areas."
