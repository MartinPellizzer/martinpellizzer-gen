    "intro": "Anoectochilus longicalcaratus, commonly known as the long-stemmed slipper orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique slipper-shaped pouch, which is adapted for trapping insects to aid in pollination. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, with lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to greenish-white, with a distinctive spur that extends from the base of the pouch. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its delicate and unusual floral structure."
