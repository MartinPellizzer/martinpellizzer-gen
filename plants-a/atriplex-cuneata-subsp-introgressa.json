    "intro": "Atriplex cuneata subsp. introgressa, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
