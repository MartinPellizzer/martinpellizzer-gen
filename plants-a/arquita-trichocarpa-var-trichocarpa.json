    "intro": "Arquita trichocarpa var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the slender arquita, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs. The leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy green upper surface and a lighter, hairy underside. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, woody fruits that split open to release seeds. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and streambanks."
