    "intro": "Asplenium triphyllum var. gracillimum, commonly known as the fragrant maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and emit a faint, pleasant aroma when crushed. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
