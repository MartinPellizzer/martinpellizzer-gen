It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Arnica bruceae thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often growing in alpine meadows. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat."
