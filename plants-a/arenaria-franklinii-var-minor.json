    "intro": "Arenaria franklinii var. minor, commonly known as Franklin's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually succulent and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. This variety is closely related to other members of the Caryophyllaceae family, sharing similar structural and ecological traits."
