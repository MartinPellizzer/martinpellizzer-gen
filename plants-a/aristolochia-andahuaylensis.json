It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, intricate flowers that resemble a pipe, often with a dark purple or brown hue. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a fleshy, orange aril. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
