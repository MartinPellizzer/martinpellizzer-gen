    "intro": "Alliaria pallens, commonly known as garlic mustard, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are hairy and emit a garlic-like odor when crushed. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring. Its seeds are contained in elongated, bladder-like pods that release the seeds when disturbed. Alliaria pallens is invasive in many regions, outcompeting native plants and affecting forest ecosystems."
