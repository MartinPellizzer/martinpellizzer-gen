    "intro": "Androsace cuscutiformis, commonly known as the parasitic androsace, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specialized growth habits, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem as both a parasite and a contributor to local biodiversity."
