It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically from May to June. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
