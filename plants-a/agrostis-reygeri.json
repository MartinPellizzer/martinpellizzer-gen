    "intro": "Agrostis reygeri, commonly known as Reyger's bentgrass, is a species of grass native to South America, particularly Argentina. It is a low-growing perennial grass that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
