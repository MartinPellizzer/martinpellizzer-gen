It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. This species is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Arabidopsis arenosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It is also used in scientific research as a model organism for studying plant genetics and evolution."
