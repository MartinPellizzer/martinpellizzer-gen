    "intro": "Aletris pauciflora f. minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf aletris, is a rare and diminutive plant species belonging to the Asparagaceae family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that form a dense rosette near the ground. The plant produces delicate, white to pale green flowers in late spring, which are clustered in small inflorescences. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in woodland areas with acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
