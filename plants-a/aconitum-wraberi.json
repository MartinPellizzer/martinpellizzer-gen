    "intro": "Aconitum wraberi, commonly known as the Wraber's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The plant features a stout, hairy stem that bears alternate, palmately compound leaves with finely toothed margins. Its roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. Aconitum wraberi thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations.",
