It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat."
