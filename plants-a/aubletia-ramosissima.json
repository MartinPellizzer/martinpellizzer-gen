    "intro": "Aubletia ramosissima, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its branching stems and clusters of small, tubular red or pink flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Aubletia ramosissima is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its unique floral structure and coloration make it an attractive addition to xeriscaped gardens."
