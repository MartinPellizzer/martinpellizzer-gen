    "intro": "Aspidium argutum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, bipinnate fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium argutum is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
