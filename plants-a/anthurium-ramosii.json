    "intro": "Anthurium ramosii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or yellow spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers inside the spathe, which are typically hidden from view. Anthurium ramosii thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
