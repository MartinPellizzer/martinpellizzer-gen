    "intro": "Athamanta arctica, commonly known as the Arctic bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. Its leaves are small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in freezing conditions. Athamanta arctica plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators in its short growing season."
