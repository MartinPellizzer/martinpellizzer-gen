    "intro": "Aspidium latebrosum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its spores are released from sporangia located on the undersides of its fronds. Aspidium latebrosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
