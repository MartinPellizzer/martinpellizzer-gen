    "intro": "Apium pretenderis, commonly known as the pretender's parsley, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that resemble those of other parsley species. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp, typical of the Apiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
