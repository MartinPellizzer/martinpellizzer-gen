    "intro": "Aspidium gaboonense, commonly known as Gaboon water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Congo Basin. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forests. Aspidium gaboonense plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing shelter and food for various small organisms."
