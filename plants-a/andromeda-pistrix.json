    "intro": "Andromeda pistrix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved andromeda, is a flowering plant native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its natural habitat. Andromeda pistrix is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
