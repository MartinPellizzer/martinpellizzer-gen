    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum var. alvarense, commonly known as alpine chives, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is often used in alpine gardens for its ornamental value and mild, garlic-like fragrance. This variety is closely related to common chives and is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in harsh conditions."
