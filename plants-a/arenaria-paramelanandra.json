    "intro": "Arenaria paramelanandra, commonly known as the coastal sandflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
