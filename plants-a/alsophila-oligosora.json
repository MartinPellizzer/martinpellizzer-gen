    "intro": "Alsophila oligosora, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feathery fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its rhizomes form a dense network that helps anchor it to the soil and absorb nutrients. The fronds are bioluminescent in some species, though this trait is more pronounced in related genera."
