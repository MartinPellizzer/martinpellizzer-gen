    "intro": "Aristolochia goldieana, commonly known as the golden Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, pipe-like flowers that are often a deep maroon or purple color. The plant produces small, green berries that mature to a bright red, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy aril. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some regions, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
