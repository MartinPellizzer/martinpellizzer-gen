    "intro": "Arisarum vulgare subsp. incurvatum, commonly known as the curled arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by insects, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. The plant's ornamental value has made it a popular choice for gardeners seeking native flora."
