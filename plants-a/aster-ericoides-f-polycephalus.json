    "intro": "Aster ericoides f. polycephalus, commonly known as the heath aster, is a flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as heaths and rocky slopes. Its foliage consists of narrow, dark green leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. This variety is notable for its distinctive, multi-headed flower clusters, which contribute to its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
