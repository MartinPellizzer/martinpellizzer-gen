    "intro": "Aristida achalensis, commonly known as the Achal Valley grass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid regions of western India. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
