    "intro": "Astragalus aksaicus, commonly known as the Kyzylkum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Fabaceae family. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus aksaicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
