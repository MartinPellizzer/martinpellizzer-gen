    "intro": "Aptosimum indivisum, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, white to pale pink flowers. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, reducing water loss through transpiration. Aptosimum indivisum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
