    "intro": "Aurinia petraea subsp. corymbosa, commonly known as the rock aurinia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky, alpine environments in Europe. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The subspecies corymbosa is distinguished by its corymbose inflorescence, which gives it a distinctive, rounded floral display. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of the Alps."
