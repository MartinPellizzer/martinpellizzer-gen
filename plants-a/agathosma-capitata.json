    "intro": "Agathosma capitata, commonly known as Cape garlic or wild thyme, is a small, aromatic shrub native to South Africa. It features small, needle-like leaves that are densely packed and emit a strong, pungent odor when crushed. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used traditionally for its antiseptic and digestive benefits."
