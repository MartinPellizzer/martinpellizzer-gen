    "intro": "Alismorkis aristulifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a aquatic herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features long, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality. Alismorkis aristulifera is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
