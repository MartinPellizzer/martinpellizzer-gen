    "intro": "Arabis albida var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features basal rosettes of pale green, lance-shaped leaves that are shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in the spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
