    "intro": "Agrostis hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically forms dense, mat-like vegetation and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a common sight in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ecological significance, it is often used in restoration projects in its native range."
