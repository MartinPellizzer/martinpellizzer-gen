    "intro": "Acer negundo f. falcatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf box elder, is a variant of the box elder tree native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically 5\u20139 inches long and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and along stream banks. This ornamental tree is valued for its adaptability and unique foliage, though it can be invasive in certain regions.",
