    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthophippium bicolor is primarily native to India and Sri Lanka. This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. Its distribution is largely restricted to these geographic areas. The species is well adapted to the climatic conditions of South Asia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophippium bicolor was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, pastures, and forest edges. It thrives in regions with moderate to high rainfall and well-drained soils. This plant is often found in the southeastern United States, particularly in states like Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, including landscaping and accidental seed dispersal. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common weed in many disturbed environments."
