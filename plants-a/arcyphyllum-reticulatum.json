    "intro": "Arcyphyllum reticulatum, commonly known as the netleaf sage, is a shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Arcyphyllum reticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
