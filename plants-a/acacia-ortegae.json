    "intro": "Acacia ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Argentina and Chile. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant has bipinnate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, and it produces flat, leathery pods that contain several seeds. Acacia ortegae is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it an important component of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia ortegae is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern Argentina and southern Bolivia. It is commonly found in the dry grasslands and rocky areas of these regions. This plant thrives in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is an important component of the local ecosystem, providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is closely associated with specific soil types and microclimates in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia ortegae was mainly introduced to South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. It was brought there for its potential use in soil stabilization and as a source of timber. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it suitable for reforestation projects. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in native ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent ecological disruption."
