    "intro": "Andinia lupula, commonly known as the common lichen, is a composite organism consisting of a fungal partner and a photosynthetic alga or cyanobacterium. It thrives in a variety of environments, including tree bark, rocks, and soil, and is often found in temperate and boreal regions. The plant's structure is typically crust-like or foliose, allowing it to adhere to surfaces and absorb nutrients from the air. It plays a crucial role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and providing habitat for microorganisms. Andinia lupula is also used in scientific research to study symbiotic relationships and environmental pollution."
