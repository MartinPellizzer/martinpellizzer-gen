    "intro": "Acer oliverianum var. serrulatum, commonly known as the serrated maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely serrated, ovate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged fruits that disperse its seeds. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
