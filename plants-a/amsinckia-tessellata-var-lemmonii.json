    "intro": "Amsinckia tessellata var. lemmonii, commonly known as the Lemmon's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many edible and ornamental plants."
