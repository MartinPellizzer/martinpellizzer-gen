    "intro": "Aegilops variabilis var. typica, commonly known as the wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and spikelets that bear small, awned lemmas. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces wind-pollinated flowers. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic improvement in wheat crops."
