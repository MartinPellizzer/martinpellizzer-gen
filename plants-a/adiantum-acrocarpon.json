It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Adiantum acrocarpon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
