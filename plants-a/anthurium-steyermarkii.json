    "intro": "Anthurium steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that can range in color from deep red to orange, often contrasting with its glossy, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spadix-like inflorescences that are typically hidden within the spathe, a common feature among Anthurium species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium steyermarkii is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
