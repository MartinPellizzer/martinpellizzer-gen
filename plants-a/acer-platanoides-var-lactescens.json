It is characterized by its broad, palmately lobed leaves that are typically pale green with a white or cream-colored underside. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to different soil conditions.",
