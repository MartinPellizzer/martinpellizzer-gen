    "intro": "Agalmyla calelanensis, commonly known as the Calelan mountain lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Alstroemeriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
