    "intro": "Anthyllis rubra, commonly known as the red anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pink to red flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Anthyllis rubra is often found in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with root nodules containing Rhizobia bacteria."
