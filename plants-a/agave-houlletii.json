    "intro": "Agave houlletii, commonly known as the Houllet's agave, is a species native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is a succulent perennial plant characterized by its rosette-forming structure and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall, branched flowering stalk that bears clusters of white to pale yellow flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, requiring minimal water and tolerating poor soil conditions. Agave houlletii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional practices by indigenous communities."
