It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly sunbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure."
