    "intro": "Acacia whitei, commonly known as the white acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched structure and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact, globular clusters. The leaves are typically bipinnate, consisting of numerous tiny leaflets, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in rocky soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",

This plant typically grows in open woodlands and along riverbanks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often seen in areas with moderate rainfall. Its distribution is largely restricted to the eastern parts of Queensland.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia whitei was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a temperate to subtropical climate. It thrives in regions with moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in open woodlands and along coastal areas. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range for ornamental and ecological purposes. However, its spread is often limited by its specific environmental requirements."
