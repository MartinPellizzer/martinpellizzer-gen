    "intro": "Atropis intermedia var. pseudomaritima, commonly known as the coastal false sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline environments. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of salt marshes. Its botanical features make it well-suited for coastal ecosystems and it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
