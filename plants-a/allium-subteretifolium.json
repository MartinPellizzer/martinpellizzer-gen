It features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly curling, with a strong garlic scent. The plant produces small, spherical umbels of white to pale purple flowers, which bloom in summer. Its bulbs are edible and often used in culinary applications similar to garlic and chives. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
