    "intro": "Aspidium pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, pinnately divided fronds that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and stream sides, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a common reproductive feature in ferns. The thick, waxy cuticle on its leaves helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat."
