    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 algeriensis, commonly known as the Algerian orchid, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Androrchis alpinus and Androrchis luteus. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in mountainous regions of North Africa. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, while its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
