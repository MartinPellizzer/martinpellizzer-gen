    "intro": "Acer nigrum var. pseudoplatanoides, commonly known as the black maple or false plane tree, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, smooth bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, red samaras that disperse its seeds, contributing to its natural range. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201330 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This variety is often mistaken for the European plane tree due to its similar appearance.",
