    "intro": "Arisaema speirophyllum subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern thread-leaf arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It features a distinctive underground tuber and produces a single, narrow, spirally twisted leaf that is often covered in a dense layer of fine, thread-like hairs. The plant's inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is usually greenish-white in color. It blooms in late spring to early summer, with small, inconspicuous flowers clustered along the spadix. This subspecies is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories."
