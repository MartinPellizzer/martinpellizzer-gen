    "intro": "Angiopteris paucinervis, commonly known as the few-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater habitats. The plant has a rhizome that produces roots and buds, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are usually light green and have a soft, feathery texture. Angiopteris paucinervis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for aquatic organisms."
