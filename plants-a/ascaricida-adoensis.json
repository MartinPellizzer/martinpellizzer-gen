    "intro": "Ascaricida adoensis, commonly known as the Adoensis wormseed, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of western Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, black seeds enclosed in a fleshy, berry-like structure. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
