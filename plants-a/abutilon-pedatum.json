The plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen along riverbanks and in open woodlands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely confined to the northern parts of Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pedatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed areas such as roadsides, stream banks, and forest edges. This plant is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns in regions where it has established itself. However, it is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
