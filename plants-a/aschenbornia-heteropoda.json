    "intro": "Aschenbornia heteropoda, commonly known as the variable leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often variegated foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Aschenbornia heteropoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
