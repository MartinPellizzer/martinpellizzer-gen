    "intro": "Anthyllis albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered broom, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves, typical of many legumes, and has a creeping growth habit that allows it to form dense mats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Anthyllis albiflora is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil."
