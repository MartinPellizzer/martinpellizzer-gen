    "intro": "Aechmea nudicaulis var. flavomarginata, commonly known as the yellow-edged pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The leaves are typically green with prominent yellow margins, giving it its distinctive appearance. It produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
