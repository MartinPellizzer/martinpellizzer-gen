    "intro": "Atriplex retusa, commonly known as the smooth saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt crystals, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Atriplex retusa is often found in saline soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high salinity."
