    "intro": "Astragalus prolixus, commonly known as the long-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus prolixus plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
