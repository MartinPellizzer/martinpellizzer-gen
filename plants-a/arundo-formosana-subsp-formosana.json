    "intro": "Arundo formosana subsp. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan reed, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in wet or moist environments, often found near water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
