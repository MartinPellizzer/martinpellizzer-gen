It is characterized by its small, disk-shaped flowers that resemble a miniature sun. The plant produces achene fruits, which are dry, indehiscent seeds with a pappus for wind dispersal. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and pollinator interactions.",
