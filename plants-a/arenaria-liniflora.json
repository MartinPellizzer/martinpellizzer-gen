    "intro": "Arenaria liniflora, commonly known as sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. Arenaria liniflora plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
