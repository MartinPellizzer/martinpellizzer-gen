    "intro": "Avena bromoides subsp. gouanii, commonly known as Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, wiry stems and spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
