    "intro": "Aconitum sachalinense var. compactum, commonly known as the compact aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features striking blue to purple spires of flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply cut and covered in a fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value.",
