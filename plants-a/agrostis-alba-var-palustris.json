    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. palustris, commonly known as the marsh bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to wetland environments. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. This variety is adapted to moist, often nutrient-poor soils and is commonly found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of water bodies. Its fine texture and ability to thrive in wet conditions make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
