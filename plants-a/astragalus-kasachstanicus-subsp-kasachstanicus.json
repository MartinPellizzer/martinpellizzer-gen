The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, and its leaves are pinnately divided with small, trifoliate leaflets. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. This subspecies is of interest in ecological and botanical studies due to its resilience and potential medicinal properties."
