    "intro": "Alkanna trichophila var. trichophila, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, tubular, pink to red flowers. The plant produces distinctive, orange-red to reddish-brown seed pods that split open when mature. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments."
