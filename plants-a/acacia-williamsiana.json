    "intro": "Acacia williamsiana, commonly known as Williams' acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in cylindrical spikes, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its seed pods are elongated and woody, containing numerous small, flattened seeds. Acacia williamsiana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils across the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia.",

It is commonly found in the coastal and inland regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This species thrives in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, heathlands, and dunes. It is well adapted to the climate of New South Wales, which includes warm summers and mild winters. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia williamsiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seed dispersal by animals and wind. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
