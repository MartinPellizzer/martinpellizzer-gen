    "intro": "Acianthera sotoana, commonly known as the Soto's acianthera, is a species of orchid native to South America, particularly found in Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, adapted to reduce water loss. Acianthera sotoana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts.",
