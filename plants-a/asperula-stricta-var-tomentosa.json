    "intro": "Asperula stricta var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly woodruff, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely covered with a soft, woolly white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are often followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense, compact growth habit and seasonal floral display."
