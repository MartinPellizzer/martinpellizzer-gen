    "intro": "Azedarach tomentosa, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its velvety, grayish-brown bark and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers in spring, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or disturbed soils. Azedarach tomentosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
