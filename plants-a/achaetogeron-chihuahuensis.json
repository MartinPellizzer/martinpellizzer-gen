It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid environments. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like body, and it lacks true leaves, stems, and roots. Achaetogeron chihuahuensis is well adapted to harsh conditions, demonstrating resilience to drought and extreme temperatures. It plays a minor but ecologically significant role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat.",
