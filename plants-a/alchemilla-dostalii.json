    "intro": "Alchemilla dostalii, commonly known as the Dostal's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Alchemilla dostalii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
