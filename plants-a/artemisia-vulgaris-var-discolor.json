    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. discolor, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which features white or pale green variegation, and its aromatic, often pungent scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows. Its medicinal and historical uses have made it a notable species in both traditional and modern herbal practices."
