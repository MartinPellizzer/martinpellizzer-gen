    "intro": "Androsace bisulca var. aurata, commonly known as the golden mouse ear, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to alpine meadows. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or silver down. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with similar growing conditions."
