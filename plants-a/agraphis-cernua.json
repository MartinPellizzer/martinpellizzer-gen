    "intro": "Agraphis cernua, commonly known as the bent grass or the common bentgrass, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring. Its reproductive structures are characterized by a single, slender flowering stem that bears several spikelets. Agraphis cernua is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
