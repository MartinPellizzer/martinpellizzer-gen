    "intro": "Astragalus aristatus var. cephalonicus, commonly known as the Cephalonic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to pink. The plant produces small, oval legumes that contain the characteristic \"milk\" sap, which is a distinguishing feature of the Astragalus genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
