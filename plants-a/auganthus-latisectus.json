    "intro": "Auganthus latisectus, commonly known as the broad-leafed auganthus, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in Mediterranean climates."
