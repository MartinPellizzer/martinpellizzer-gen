    "intro": "Acer campestre var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-seeded hedge maple, is a variant of the field maple. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe and western Asia. The plant is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and prominent veins. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The fruit is a samara, typically larger than that of the typical field maple, contributing to its common name.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. macrocarpum is primarily native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe, including countries such as Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, and parts of Russia. It is commonly found in woodland edges, open forests, and rocky soils. This variety is known for its distinctive large, showy fruits and is often associated with calcareous soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is well adapted to a variety of light conditions. Its distribution reflects its historical range across the temperate regions of Europe.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer campestre var. macrocarpum was mainly introduced to North America during the 19th century as an ornamental tree due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. It has since been cultivated in various regions across the continent, particularly in the northeastern and midwestern United States. The plant is often found in urban and suburban landscapes, where it thrives in a range of soil types and environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential ecological impact. Despite its non-native status, it remains a popular choice for landscaping and reforestation projects."
