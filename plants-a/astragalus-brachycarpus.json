    "intro": "Astragalus brachycarpus, commonly known as the short-carpel milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow to brown flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the Fabaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in small, curved pods that mature into the distinctive \"short carpels\" for which it is named. Astragalus brachycarpus is well adapted to harsh environments, often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats."
