It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit and resilience make it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
