    "intro": "Allium cepa var. sylvestre, commonly known as wild leek, is a perennial plant native to the forests of North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, grass-like leaves and small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces a bulbous structure similar to garlic and onions, which is used in culinary applications. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical features make it distinct from cultivated leeks and onions, with a more delicate flavor profile."
