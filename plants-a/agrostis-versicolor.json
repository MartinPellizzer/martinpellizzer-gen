    "intro": "Agrostis versicolor, commonly known as the variable bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish to brownish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps distinguish it from similar species. Agrostis versicolor is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
