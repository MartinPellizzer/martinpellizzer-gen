    "intro": "Avena sterilis var. maxima, commonly known as the Mexican needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a hairy texture and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Avena sterilis var. maxima is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soils."
