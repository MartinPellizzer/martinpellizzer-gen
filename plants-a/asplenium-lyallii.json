    "intro": "Asplenium lyallii, commonly known as Lyall's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium lyallii is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in New Zealand's unique flora."
