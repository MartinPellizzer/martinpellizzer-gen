    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. gracile, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, terrestrial fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in shaded, humid environments. The plant features finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces sporangia in clusters on the undersides of its fronds, which are characteristic of the Asplenium genus. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a houseplant due to its ornamental value."
