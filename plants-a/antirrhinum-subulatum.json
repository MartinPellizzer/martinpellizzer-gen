It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically blooms in late summer and early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and needle-like, giving it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Antirrhinum subulatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
