It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes.

Astragalus ancistron is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
