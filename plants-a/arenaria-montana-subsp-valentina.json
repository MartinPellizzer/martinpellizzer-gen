    "intro": "Arenaria montana subsp. valentina, commonly known as the Valentina sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive addition to rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
