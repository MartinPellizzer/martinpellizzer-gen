    "intro": "Attalea funifera, commonly known as the palm tree, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a tall, slender palm with a smooth, unbranched trunk that can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The plant produces large, pinnate leaves that are often used for thatching and roofing. Its fruits are small, round berries that contain a single seed, and it is adapted to thrive in wetland and swampy environments. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
