    "intro": "Astronidium lepidopunctatum, commonly known as the velvetleaf starling tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, showy flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
