    "intro": "Angiopteris magnifica, commonly known as the giant shield fern, is a large, tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its enormous, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a thick, creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they have a complex, feather-like arrangement of smaller leaves. Angiopteris magnifica thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
