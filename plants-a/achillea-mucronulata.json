    "intro": "Achillea mucronulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry, branched stems and basal leaves that are narrow and linear, often with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and alpine settings. Its historical use in traditional medicine is attributed to its aromatic compounds and potential anti-inflammatory properties.",
