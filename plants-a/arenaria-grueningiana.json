    "intro": "Arenaria grueningiana, commonly known as the Gruening's sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of foliage on rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh, cold environments. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Its flowers are white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and bloom in late summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra habitats."
