    "intro": "Acacia welwitschii, commonly known as the giant devil's claw, is a tall, spiny shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its long, straight, woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, cylindrical clusters, which are followed by distinctive, inflated seed pods. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought resistance and deep root systems. Acacia welwitschii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia welwitschii is primarily native to Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is commonly found in dry savannas and woodland areas within these regions. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with rocky or sandy habitats. Acacia welwitschii plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia welwitschii was mainly introduced to regions with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in parts of Africa and Australia. It is commonly found in areas with well-drained soils and low rainfall. This plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological impacts due to its invasive tendencies. It is valued for its ornamental features and potential for land rehabilitation."
