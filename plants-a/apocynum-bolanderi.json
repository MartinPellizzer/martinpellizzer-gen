    "intro": "Apocynum bolanderi, commonly known as Bolander's milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its stout, woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, typical of the Apocynaceae family, is toxic and serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Bolander's milkweed is often found in dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
