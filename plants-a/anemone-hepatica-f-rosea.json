    "intro": "Anemone hepatica f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-liverleaf anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with reddish veins, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, sometimes with a rose-like hue. The plant thrives in woodland habitats and prefers moist, well-drained soil. It blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. The variety 'rosea' is distinguished by its more pronounced pinkish flower color compared to the typical white of the species."
