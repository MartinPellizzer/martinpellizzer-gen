    "intro": "Alyxia markgrafii, commonly known as the coastal alyxia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters during the late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Alyxia markgrafii is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
