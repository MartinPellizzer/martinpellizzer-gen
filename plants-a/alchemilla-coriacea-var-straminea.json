It features a low-growing rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in dense, rounded clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its distinctive foliage and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
