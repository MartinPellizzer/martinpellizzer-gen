    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella tequilana is primarily native to Mexico Central, Mexico Northeast, Mexico Northwest, and Mexico Southwest. This species is commonly found in the dry and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in rocky soils and is often associated with limestone formations. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and is an important part of the native vegetation. It is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella tequilana was mainly introduced to the southern United States, particularly in Texas and New Mexico, as well as parts of California. It was brought in for its ornamental value due to its unique foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant is commonly found in xeriscaped gardens and along roadsides in these regions. It has also been introduced to some areas of Arizona and southern Nevada. Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is considered an invasive species in certain locations, outcompeting native vegetation."
