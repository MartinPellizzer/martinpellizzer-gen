    "intro": "Astephanus utahensis, commonly known as the Utah stephanus, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of Utah and neighboring states. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowering stems bear small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Astephanus utahensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying desert flora."
