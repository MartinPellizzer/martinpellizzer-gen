It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are compound, with a distinctive lobed structure, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised as parts of the plant can be poisonous."
