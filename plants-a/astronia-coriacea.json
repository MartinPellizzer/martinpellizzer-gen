    "intro": "Astronia coriacea, commonly known as the rough-leaved astronia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The leaves are thick, leathery, and covered in a fine, rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry woodlands or rocky areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in some cultures."
