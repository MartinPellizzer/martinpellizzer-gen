It is a perennial herb characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Native to North America, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
