    "intro": "Angraecum laggiarae, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender flower spikes that bear numerous white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive star-like shape. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by moths, with a long nectar spur that matches the proboscis of its pollinators. Angraecum laggiarae is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its beauty and rarity."
