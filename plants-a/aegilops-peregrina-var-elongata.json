    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina var. elongata, commonly known as the slender wild barley, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, elongated spikelets and narrow leaves, which are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found growing in fields, along roadsides, and in dry, rocky areas. This variety is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to modern wheat varieties."
