    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum subsp. moldavicum, commonly known as the Moldavian monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers arranged in a helmet-like shape, which are typical of the genus Aconitum. The plant has dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care and avoid ingestion.",
