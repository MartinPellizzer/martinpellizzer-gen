    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema commutata is primarily native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, tropical environments with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in secondary forests and disturbed areas within its native range. Abarema commutata is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive flowers.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema commutata was mainly introduced to control erosion and for ornamental purposes in tropical and subtropical regions. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides due to its rapid growth and adaptability. The plant has been reported in several countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some ecosystems. However, it is not widely considered a major invasive species in the regions where it has been introduced."
