It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a tall, slender stem with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care.",
