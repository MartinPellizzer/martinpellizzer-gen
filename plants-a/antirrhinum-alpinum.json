It is characterized by its upright growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange and yellow. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant produces seeds in pods that split open when mature. Antirrhinum alpinum is a hardy species that is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
