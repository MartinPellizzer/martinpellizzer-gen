    "intro": "Ammannia kilimandscharica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro ammannia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Ammannia kilimandscharica is often found in rocky or grassland habitats at elevations above 2,000 meters."
