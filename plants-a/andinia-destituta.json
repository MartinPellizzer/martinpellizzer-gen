    "intro": "Andinia destituta, commonly known as the naked orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is notable for its reduced foliage, with leaves that are often small and sparse, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often in rocky soils, and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andinia destituta is considered a vulnerable species."
