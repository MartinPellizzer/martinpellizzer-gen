    "intro": "Arbutus coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet madrone, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-barked trunk and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. Its foliage and fruit provide food for various wildlife, including birds and mammals. Arbutus coccinea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal forest ecosystems."
