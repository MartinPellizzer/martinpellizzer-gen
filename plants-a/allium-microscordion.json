    "intro": "Allium microscordion, commonly known as the narrow-leaved garlic, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often mistaken for true bulbs, though they are more accurately classified as corms. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
