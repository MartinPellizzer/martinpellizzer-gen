It is characterized by its bulbous stem and long, narrow leaves that resemble those of leeks. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Allium genus. It is native to East Asia, particularly Japan, and thrives in temperate climates. This variety is often grown for its edible leaves and bulbs, which have a mild garlic flavor."
