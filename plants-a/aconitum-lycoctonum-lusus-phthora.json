    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum lusus phthora, commonly known as the deadly larkspur, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer. The plant contains potent alkaloids, such as aconitine, which make it highly toxic to humans and animals. Its roots and leaves are particularly dangerous if ingested. Due to its toxicity, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural settings.",
