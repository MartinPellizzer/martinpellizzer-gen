    "intro": "Anchusa, commonly known as the spurred gentian, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of western Asia, often thriving in rocky or dry soils. Anchusa species are characterized by their showy blue or purple flowers, which are typically tubular with a spurred petal at the back. They are perennial herbs that often form dense clumps, and their leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. The genus includes several species, such as Anchusa italica and Anchusa tetraphylla, which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
