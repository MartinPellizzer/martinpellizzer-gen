    "intro": "Androsace maxima var. stricta, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, cushion-like foliage composed of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is often used in rock gardens and alpine arrangements."
