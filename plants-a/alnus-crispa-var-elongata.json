It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forest edges. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often pubescent, and it produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This species plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various wildlife species."
