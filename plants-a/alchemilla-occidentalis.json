It features a rosette of basal, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces upright flowering stems with small, yellowish-green flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
