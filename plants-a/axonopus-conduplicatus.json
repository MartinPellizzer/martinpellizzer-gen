    "intro": "Axonopus conduplicatus, commonly known as the common carpetgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing mat-forming growth habit, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly folded. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its aggressive spreading nature, it can become invasive in certain environments."
