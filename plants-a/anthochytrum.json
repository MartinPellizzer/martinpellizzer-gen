    "intro": "Anthochytrum, commonly known as the yellow stinkhorn, is a genus of fungi that belongs to the family Phallaceae. These fungi are characterized by their unique, often foul-smelling fruiting bodies that play a role in decomposing organic matter. The spore-bearing structure, called the gleba, is typically yellow or orange and attracts flies for spore dispersal. Anthochytrum species are found in moist, humid environments, often on decaying wood or leaf litter. They are important in nutrient cycling within forest ecosystems."
