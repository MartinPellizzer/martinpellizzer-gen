    "intro": "Asplenium pseudocapillipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Asplenium pseudocapillipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
