    "intro": "Aspidopterys tomentosa var. longirostris, commonly known as the long-beaked tree fern, is a species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds that give it a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a dense, velvety texture due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. This variety is well-suited to humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests."
