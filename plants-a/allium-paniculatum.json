    "intro": "Allium paniculatum, commonly known as the purple bulbous onion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features a bulbous base with a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched stems topped with dense, spherical clusters of small, purple or pink flowers. The plant is characterized by its aromatic foliage and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Allium paniculatum is also known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
