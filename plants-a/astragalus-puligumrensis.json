It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat. Due to its resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
