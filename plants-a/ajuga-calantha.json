    "intro": "Ajuga calantha, commonly known as silver carpet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage that is silver-white to gray-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ajuga calantha thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It is also valued for its ability to suppress weeds and its ornamental appeal in shaded landscapes."
