    "intro": "Arum orientale subsp. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a striking, arrow-shaped leaf that is typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, which is usually a deep purple or maroon color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
