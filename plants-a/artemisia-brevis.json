    "intro": "Artemisia brevis, commonly known as the shortleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its aromatic compounds make it useful in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent. Artemisia brevis is also valued in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
