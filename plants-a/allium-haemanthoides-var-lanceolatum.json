    "intro": "Allium haemanthoides var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate garlic. It is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa, characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant produces a strong garlic odor when the leaves are crushed, due to the presence of sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical features make it an attractive and aromatic addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
