    "intro": "Arabis nasturtium, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, bright yellow flowers. The plant is known for its peppery, tangy flavor, which comes from compounds like glucosinolates. It thrives in moist, cool environments and is often found near streams and damp soil. Watercress is not only a culinary herb but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
