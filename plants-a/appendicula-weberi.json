    "intro": "Appendicula weberi, commonly known as the Weber's appendicula, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant produces small, clustered leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in rocky or forested habitats at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
