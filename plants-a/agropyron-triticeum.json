It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that bear small, two-lobed flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in prairies and disturbed soils. Agropyron triticeum is valued for its potential in forage and as a source of grain for human consumption."
