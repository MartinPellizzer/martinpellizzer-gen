    "intro": "Alectorolophus pampaninii, commonly known as the Pampas lichen, is a unique lichen species belonging to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, adherent layer on rock surfaces, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. The thallus is usually pale yellow to orange in color, with a distinct, granular texture. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying on photosynthesis through its symbiotic association with algae or cyanobacteria. This lichen is often found in regions with low humidity and high sunlight exposure, such as the Pampas grasslands of South America."
