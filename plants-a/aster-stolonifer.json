    "intro": "Aster stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit, with stolons that root at the nodes to form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stems. Aster stolonifer is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, making it a common sight in various natural habitats."
