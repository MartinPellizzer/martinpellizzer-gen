    "intro": "Anagallis phillipsii, commonly known as the pink evening primrose, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. Anagallis phillipsii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting night-active pollinators."
