    "intro": "Acorus calamus var. europeus, commonly known as European sweetflag, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and colonize wetland environments. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its flowering stems produce small, yellowish-green spathes that enclose the spores. This variety is adapted to moist or aquatic habitats and is often used in wetland restoration projects.",
