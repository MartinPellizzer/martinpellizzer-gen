    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. scotica, commonly known as the Scottish thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of Scotland and northern England. It features dense clusters of pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its salty, windy habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for coastal gardens and erosion control."
