    "intro": "Anthurium resectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces striking red spathes that enclose bright yellow spadices, creating a dramatic floral display. It thrives in humid, warm environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium resectum is popular as a houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
