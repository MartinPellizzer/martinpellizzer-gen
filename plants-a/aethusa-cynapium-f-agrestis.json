    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium f. agrestis, commonly known as the field cowbane, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant has erect, branching stems with opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps, which contain two mericarps that separate when mature."
