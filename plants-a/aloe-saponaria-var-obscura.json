    "intro": "Aloe saponaria var. obscura, commonly known as the dark aloe or obscura aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dark green, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues, especially in full sun. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its thick, waxy leaves store moisture, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping."
