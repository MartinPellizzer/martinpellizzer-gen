    "intro": "Astragalus prosgaeus, commonly known as the Turk's cap milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Astragalus prosgaeus is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
