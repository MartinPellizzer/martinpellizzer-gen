    "intro": "Alchemilla subcrenatiformis, commonly known as the wrinkled-leaved lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, wavy-edged leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces upright flowering stems bearing small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate wet conditions."
