It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a historical use in traditional medicine. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
