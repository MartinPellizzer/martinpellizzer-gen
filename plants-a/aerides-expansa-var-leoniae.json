    "intro": "Aerides expansa var. leoniae, commonly known as the Leonia's Vanda, is a hybrid orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, pendant inflorescences that bear numerous fragrant, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and dark green, adapted to store water in its native tropical environment. This variety is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
