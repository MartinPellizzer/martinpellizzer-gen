It is characterized by its tufted, fibrous growth habit and small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. It is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in arid environments. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptation to harsh conditions."
