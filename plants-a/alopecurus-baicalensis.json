    "intro": "Alopecurus baicalensis, commonly known as the Baikal mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly China and Russia. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are narrow and hairless, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that bloom in early summer. Alopecurus baicalensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
