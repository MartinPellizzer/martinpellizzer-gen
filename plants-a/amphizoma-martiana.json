    "intro": "Amphizoma martiana, commonly known as the red-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with deep red veins contrasting against a white or pale pink background. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in forest understories. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
