    "intro": "Aulacospermum depressum, commonly known as the flat-leaf aulacospermum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes. Aulacospermum depressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
