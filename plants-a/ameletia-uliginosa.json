    "intro": "Ameletia uliginosa, commonly known as the swamp buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in North America. It produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has alternate, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Ameletia uliginosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for wetland health."
