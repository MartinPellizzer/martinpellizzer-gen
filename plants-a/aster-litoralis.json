    "intro": "Aster litoralis, commonly known as sea aster, is a coastal plant native to the northern Atlantic coast of North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces showy blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Sea aster plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
