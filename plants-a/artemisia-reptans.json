    "intro": "Artemisia reptans, commonly known as creeping wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia reptans is often used in traditional medicine and as a ground cover in landscaping."
