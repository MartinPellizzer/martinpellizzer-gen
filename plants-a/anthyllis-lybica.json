    "intro": "Anthyllis lybica, commonly known as the Lybian clover, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish or reddish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. Anthyllis lybica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
