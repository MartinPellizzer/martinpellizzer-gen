    "intro": "Aspidium bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate regions with high humidity. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium bosniacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
