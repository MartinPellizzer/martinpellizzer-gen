    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. americana, commonly known as American oat, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets with bracts that enclose the florets, which are small, two-lobed flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
