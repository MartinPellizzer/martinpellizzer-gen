    "intro": "Artemisia sieberi, commonly known as Siberian tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features silver-gray, aromatic leaves with a distinctive camphor-like scent, which is due to the presence of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Its medicinal and aromatic properties have made it valuable in traditional herbal remedies and culinary applications."
