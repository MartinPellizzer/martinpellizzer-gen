    "intro": "Avena georgiana, commonly known as the Georgia oat or wild oat, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, and it typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Avena georgiana is often considered a weed but has historical use in traditional medicine."
