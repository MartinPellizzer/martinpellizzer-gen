    "intro": "Aconitum vulparia f. adenosepalum, commonly known as the yellow aconite, is a variant of the European aconite characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers. This plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is native to central and southern Europe. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, often with a contrasting black or purple base. The leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided lobes, and the plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is considered ornamental but is toxic due to the presence of potent alkaloids.",
