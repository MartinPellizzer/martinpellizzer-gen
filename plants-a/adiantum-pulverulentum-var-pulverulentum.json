    "intro": "Adiantum pulverulentum var. pulverulentum, commonly known as the powdered maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to southern China and parts of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a powdery texture, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Adiantum genus. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions.",
