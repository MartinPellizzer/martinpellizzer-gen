    "intro": "Asterostigma lividum, commonly known as the blue-stained aster, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique coloration is due to the presence of specific pigments in its leaves and petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Asterostigma lividum is considered a conservation concern."
