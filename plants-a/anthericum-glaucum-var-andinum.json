    "intro": "Anthericum glaucum var. andinum, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a perennial herb native to the high Andes of South America. It features lance-shaped, glaucous-blue leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
