    "intro": "Apium decumbens, commonly known as the creeping parsley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its prostrate growth habit. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild parsley-like scent, while the small white flowers appear in clusters. Apium decumbens is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
