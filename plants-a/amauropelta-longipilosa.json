    "intro": "Amauropelta longipilosa, commonly known as the long-hair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its distinctive fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features long, slender fronds with fine, hairy structures along the veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
