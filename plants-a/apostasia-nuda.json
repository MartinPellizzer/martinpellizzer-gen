    "intro": "Apostasia nuda, commonly known as the naked apostasia, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated inflorescence that bears numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are predominantly pollinated by flies and beetles, which are attracted to its strong, musky scent. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Apostasia nuda is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
