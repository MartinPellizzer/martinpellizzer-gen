    "intro": "Arctagrostis angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 1 inch wide, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This species is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
