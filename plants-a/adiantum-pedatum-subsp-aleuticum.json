    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum subsp. aleuticum, commonly known as the Aleut maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble lace, with a distinctive central vein. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in woodland areas. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new growth from the base, allowing it to spread gradually. The fronds are typically biennial, with the first year's growth being spore-bearing and the second year's being sterile.",
