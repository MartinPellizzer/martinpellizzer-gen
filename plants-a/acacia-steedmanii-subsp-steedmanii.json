    "intro": "Acacia steedmanii subsp. steedmanii, commonly known as the Steedman's wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Western Australia. It features slender, zigzagging branches and produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that perform the function of true leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping in suitable climates.",

This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. It is typically found in open woodlands and shrublands. Its distribution is largely restricted to the coastal and interior areas of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia steedmanii subsp. steedmanii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and urban areas where it thrives in well-drained soils. However, it has also become naturalized in some regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. Its introduction has led to discussions about its role in both landscaping and ecological management."
