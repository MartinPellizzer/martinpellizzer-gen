    "intro": "Alnus viridis var. suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented alder, is a variant of the green alder native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. The plant is characterized by its finely toothed, oval leaves and small, yellowish-green catkins that appear in early spring. Its flowers are dioecious, with separate male and female flowers on different plants, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. The species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
