    "intro": "Astragalus rostratus, commonly known as the rostrate milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Astragalus rostratus is known for its deep root system, which helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
