    "intro": "Agropyron acutum var. subrepens, commonly known as the creeping wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with fine, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, including rocky soils and high altitudes, and is often used in restoration ecology due to its hardiness. Its botanical features make it an important species for soil stabilization and ecological resilience."
