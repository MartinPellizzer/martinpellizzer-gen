It features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has finely toothed, ovate leaves that are covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for garden borders or as a hedge. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate foliage and fragrant blooms."
