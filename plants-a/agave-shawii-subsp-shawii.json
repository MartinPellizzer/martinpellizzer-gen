    "intro": "Agave shawii subsp. shawii, commonly known as the Shaw's agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a grayish-blue waxy coating. The plant produces a tall, spiky inflorescence that bears showy, yellowish-green flowers. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to store water efficiently. Its slow growth and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
