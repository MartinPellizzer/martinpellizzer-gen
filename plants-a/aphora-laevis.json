    "intro": "Aphora laevis, commonly known as the smooth aphora, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features slender, upright stems covered in smooth, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Aphora laevis prefers well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable plant for garden cultivation."
