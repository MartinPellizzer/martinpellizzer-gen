    "intro": "Acer opulifolium var. valentinum, commonly known as the Valentine maple, is a variant of the mountain maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a heart, giving it its common name. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks, preferring cooler climates. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras that aid in its propagation.",
