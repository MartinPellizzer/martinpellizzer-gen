It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky or sandy soils. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Astragalus nagaii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
