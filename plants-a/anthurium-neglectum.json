    "intro": "Anthurium neglectum, commonly known as the Neglectum arrowhead, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences surrounded by a colorful spathe, often in shades of red or orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium neglectum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
