It is characterized by its distinctive, acorn-shaped seed pods and hairy, gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains latex. Asclepias acornuta serves as a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly and other pollinators."
