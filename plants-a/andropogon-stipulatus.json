    "intro": "Andropogon stipulatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green foliage and tall, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Andropogon stipulatus is also an important forage plant for wildlife and livestock."
