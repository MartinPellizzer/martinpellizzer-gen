It features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, typically turning bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant fall foliage and adaptability to wet environments.",
