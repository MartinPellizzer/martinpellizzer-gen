    "intro": "Atriplex radiata, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss, making it well adapted to saline and drought-prone environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Atriplex radiata is also valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is used in rehabilitation of degraded lands."
