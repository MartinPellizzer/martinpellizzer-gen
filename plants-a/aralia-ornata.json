    "intro": "Aralia ornata, commonly known as the white woodbine, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbel-like clusters, which are followed by bright red berries that attract birds. Its root system is fibrous and can spread widely, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. Aralia ornata thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, wooded areas."
