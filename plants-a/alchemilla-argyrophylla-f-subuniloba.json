    "intro": "Alchemilla argyrophylla f. subuniloba, commonly known as silverleaf lady's mantle, is a variant of the alchemilla genus native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on elongated pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
