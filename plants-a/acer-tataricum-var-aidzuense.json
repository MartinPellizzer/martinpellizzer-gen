    "intro": "Acer tataricum var. aidzuense, commonly known as the Aidzu maple, is a rare variant of the Tatarian maple native to Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are typically green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts.",
