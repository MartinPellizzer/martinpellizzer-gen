    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthonema strigosum is primarily native to the eastern United States, particularly in the southeastern regions. It is commonly found in wetland habitats such as bogs, marshes, and swampy areas. This plant thrives in acidic soils and is often associated with pine forests. Its distribution extends from North Carolina to Florida and westward into parts of Georgia and Alabama. It is an important component of the local flora in these wetland ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthonema strigosum was mainly introduced to areas with moist, acidic soils and shaded environments, often found in forest understories. It is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as abandoned fields and along stream banks. The plant thrives in regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. Its introduction has been documented in several parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. Due to its adaptability, it has become a common sight in both natural and human-altered landscapes."
