It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions."
