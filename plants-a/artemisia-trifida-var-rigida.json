    "intro": "Artemisia trifida var. rigida, commonly known as rigid tarragon, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flower heads. The plant has feathery, branched stems and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its essential oils contain compounds like thujone and camphor, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. This variety is closely related to other artemisia species and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
