It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosette of gray-green leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Azorella glabra is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine and subantarctic regions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
