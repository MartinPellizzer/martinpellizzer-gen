    "intro": "Axyris prostrata f. ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaf axyris, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically ovate in shape, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often blooming during the warmer months. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soil conditions and withstand drought. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
