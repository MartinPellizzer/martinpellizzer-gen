    "intro": "Agrostis pilosula f. wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features fine, wiry leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
