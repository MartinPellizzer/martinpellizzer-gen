    "intro": "Achoriphragma albidum, commonly known as the white sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit with small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Achoriphragma albidum is adapted to survive in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures.",
