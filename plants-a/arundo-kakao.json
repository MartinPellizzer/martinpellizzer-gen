    "intro": "Arundo kakao, commonly known as the chocolate cane, is a tall, reed-like plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its hollow, fibrous stems and large, palmate leaves that can reach several feet in length. The plant is often found near water sources, thriving in moist, swampy environments. Its name derives from the sweet, chocolate-flavored sap that can be extracted from its stems. This sap has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural sweetener."
