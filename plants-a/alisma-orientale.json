    "intro": "Alisma orientale, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its rhizomes are commonly used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Alisma orientale is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in aquatic environments."
