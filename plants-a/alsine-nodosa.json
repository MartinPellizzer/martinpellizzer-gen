    "intro": "Alsine nodosa, commonly known as nodding alsike, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and branching. The seed pods are small, capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature."
