    "intro": "Actinidia arguta var. giraldii, commonly known as the hardy kiwifruit or Chinese mayapple, is a deciduous vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer, though they are not as commonly consumed as the more popular fuzzy kiwifruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to climb or trail along structures.",
