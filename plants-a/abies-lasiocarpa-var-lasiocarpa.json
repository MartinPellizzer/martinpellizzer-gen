    "intro": "Abies lasiocarpa var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the subalpine fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its narrow, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically shorter and more rigid than those of other fir species. The tree produces small, spherical cones that hang downward, containing winged seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often forming dense stands in subalpine and alpine zones. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species in its native range.",
