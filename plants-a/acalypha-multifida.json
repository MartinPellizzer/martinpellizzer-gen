    "intro": "Acalypha multifida, commonly known as the palmate spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are deeply lobed and give the plant a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments.",

The plant thrives in humid and shaded environments. It is often seen growing along riverbanks and in dense undergrowth. Its native distribution is largely restricted to this specific geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha multifida was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was first brought to the country in the late 19th century by European settlers who admired its aesthetic value. Despite its initial popularity in gardens, it has since become a weed in some areas, spreading rapidly in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of conditions has contributed to its successful establishment in the environment. However, its invasive potential has led to increased monitoring and management efforts in certain regions."
