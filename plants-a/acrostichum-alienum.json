    "intro": "Acrostichum alienum, commonly known as the giant reed or common reed, is a tall, perennial grass that thrives in wetland environments. It is characterized by its long, slender leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. Acrostichum alienum is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes.",
