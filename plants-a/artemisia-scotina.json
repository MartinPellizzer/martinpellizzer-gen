    "intro": "Artemisia scotina, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains volatile oils and sesquiterpene lactones, which contribute to its strong medicinal and pesticidal properties. Artemisia scotina thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has been historically used in traditional medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
