    "intro": "Armeria choulettiana subvar. pulchra, commonly known as the pink sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features dense clusters of pink or purple flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical seed capsules that release seeds through a unique mechanism involving the drying and splitting of the capsule. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
