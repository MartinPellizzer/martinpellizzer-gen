    "intro": "Aeoniopsis cabulica, commonly known as the Afghan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the high-altitude regions of Afghanistan. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink during the summer months. Aeoniopsis cabulica is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
