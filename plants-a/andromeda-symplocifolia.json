    "intro": "Andromeda symplocifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf andromeda, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and natural landscapes."
