    "intro": "Asplenium hookerianum var. colensoi, commonly known as the Colenso's maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
