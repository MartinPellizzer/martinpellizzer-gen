    "intro": "Aloe subverrucosa, commonly known as the rough-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, tuberculate bumps, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive drought conditions. Aloe subverrucosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and resilience."
