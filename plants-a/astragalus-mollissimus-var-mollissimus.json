    "intro": "Astragalus mollissimus var. mollissimus, commonly known as the soft hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Astragalus mollissimus var. mollissimus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
