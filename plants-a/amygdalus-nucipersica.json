It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other members of the Prunus genus. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by almond-like fruits that are harvested when mature. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, typical of many rose family plants. The tree is valued for its ornamental beauty and has historical significance in traditional medicine and horticulture."
