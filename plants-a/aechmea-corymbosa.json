    "intro": "Aechmea corymbosa, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces a striking inflorescence with colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Aechmea corymbosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
