    "intro": "Aristolochia stuckertii, commonly known as the Stuckert's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, which are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and can grow quite large, often reaching up to 30 centimeters in diameter. This species is valued in horticulture for its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal."
