    "intro": "Argemone munita subsp. rotundata, commonly known as the Mexican prickly poppy, is a species of flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking orange to red flowers and its hairy, spiny stems and leaves. The plant belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is known for its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Its seeds are encased in a hard, spiky capsule, which aids in seed dispersal. The plant is also notable for its latex-like sap, which contains toxic compounds."
