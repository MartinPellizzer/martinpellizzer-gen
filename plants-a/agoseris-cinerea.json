    "intro": "Agoseris cinerea, commonly known as the gray gentian, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a compact, low-growing form. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Agoseris cinerea is often found in meadows and open woodlands, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
