    "intro": "Arabis pubescens var. pseudodecumbens, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine environments in Europe. It features basal leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
