    "intro": "Astragalus magnibracteatus, commonly known as the large-bract milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its erect growth habit, hairy stems, and pinnately compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spiny pods. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Astragalus magnibracteatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
