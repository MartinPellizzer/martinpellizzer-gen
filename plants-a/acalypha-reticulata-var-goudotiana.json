It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the rainforests and humid lowland areas. This variant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its striking red bracts. It thrives in tropical climates with high humidity and well-drained soil. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha reticulata var. goudotiana was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscapes in countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and parts of Southeast Asia. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant red and green leaf patterns. It has been used in horticulture for decorative purposes, though it can become invasive in some areas if not managed properly. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impact in non-native environments."
