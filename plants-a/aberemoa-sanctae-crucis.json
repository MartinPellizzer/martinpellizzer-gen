    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Aberemoa sanctae-crucis is primarily native to the Caribbean region, particularly the Greater Antilles. It is found in countries such as Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and is often associated with sandy soils near the shore. It is commonly found in mangrove ecosystems and along the edges of saltwater wetlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aberemoa sanctae-crucis was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
