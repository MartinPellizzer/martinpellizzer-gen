It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with gray-green foliage covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Alopecias narbonensis is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and scree slopes."
