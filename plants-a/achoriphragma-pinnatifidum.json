    "intro": "Achoriphragma pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects.",
