    "intro": "Alsine macrocarpa var. inamoena, commonly known as the broadleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a sprawling habit, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is adapted to dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils through its extensive root system."
