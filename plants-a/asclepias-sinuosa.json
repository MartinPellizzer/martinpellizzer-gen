    "intro": "Asclepias sinuosa, commonly known as the zigzag milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Asclepias sinuosa is a vital host plant for monarch butterfly larvae, making it important for pollinators and ecological balance. Its latex sap contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores."
