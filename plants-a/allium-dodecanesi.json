    "intro": "Allium dodecanesi, commonly known as the Dodecanese garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Greek island of Rhodes. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a distinctive garlic-like scent. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and mild flavor, though it is less commonly used in cooking compared to other allium species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
