    "intro": "Androsace cylindrica subsp. willkommii, commonly known as the Alpine bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, moist environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens."
