    "intro": "Astragalus altaicus, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding plant communities."
