    "intro": "Alchemilla alpina var. godetii, commonly known as the Alpine Lady's Mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features distinctive, velvety, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
