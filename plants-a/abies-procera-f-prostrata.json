    "intro": "Abies procera f. prostrata, commonly known as the dwarf subalpine fir, is a low-growing variant of the white fir. It exhibits a prostrate growth habit, forming dense mats of needle-like foliage close to the ground. The plant has scale-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the stems. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in subalpine and alpine regions. This form is adapted to harsh mountain conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies procera f. prostrata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. This subspecies is found in areas such as California, Oregon, and Washington. It typically grows in high elevation forests and is adapted to cool, moist climates. The plant thrives in areas with well-drained soils and is often found in association with other coniferous species. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies procera f. prostrata was mainly introduced to specific regions with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, often in mountainous areas. It was introduced for its ornamental value, including its compact form and attractive foliage. This variety is commonly used in horticulture for landscaping and as a specimen plant. It has been introduced to parts of North America, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native environments."
