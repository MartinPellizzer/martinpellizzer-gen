    "intro": "Atractylis cancellata var. canescens, commonly known as the woolly nettle or hairy centaury, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in compact clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
