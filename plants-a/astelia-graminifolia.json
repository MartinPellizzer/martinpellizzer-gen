    "intro": "[WRONG START] Asteleia graminifolia, commonly known as the tufted flax, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves that form dense tufts, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Astelia graminifolia has fibrous roots and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance. It is also used in traditional M\u0101ori practices for its fibrous material."
