    "intro": "Anisacanthus puberulus, commonly known as the desert candle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, orange-red flowers. The plant produces a distinctive, candle-like seed pod that persists through winter, adding ornamental value to the landscape. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
