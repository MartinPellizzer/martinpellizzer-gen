    "intro": "Angorkis galeandrae, commonly known as the silverleaf orchid, is a rare and exotic plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, silver-green leaves that are covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat-specific needs, it is considered a conservation concern."
