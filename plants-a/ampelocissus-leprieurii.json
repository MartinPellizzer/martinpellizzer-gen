It features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often grown as an ornamental plant. Its ability to climb makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in gardens."
