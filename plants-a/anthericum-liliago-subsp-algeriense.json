    "intro": "Anthericum liliago subsp. algeriense, commonly known as Algerian adder's-tongue, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller leaves and shorter inflorescences compared to the typical form of Anthericum liliago."
