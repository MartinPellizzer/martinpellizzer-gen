    "intro": "Acacia heteroneura var. prolixa, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear phyllodes that are often covered with a fine layer of white to greyish pubescence. The plant produces yellow globular flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive foliage.",

It is commonly found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in areas with sandy soils. This variety of acacia thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the climate conditions of the region, including high temperatures and low rainfall. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia heteroneura var. prolixa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as part of ornamental horticulture due to its unique appearance and hardy nature. It was initially cultivated for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it has since become naturalized in certain regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. The plant's spread has been limited by its preference for specific microhabitats and climatic conditions. Despite its ornamental value, ongoing monitoring is recommended to assess its ecological effects."
