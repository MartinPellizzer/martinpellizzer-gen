    "intro": "Artemisia vulgaris var. major, commonly known as wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its strong, bitter scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in herbal medicine and as a flavoring agent."
