    "intro": "Asplenium viviparioides, commonly known as the viviparous spleenwort, is a fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its small, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically clustered around the base of the plant. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. It is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. Asplenium viviparioides is a common epiphytic fern in tropical and subtropical regions."
