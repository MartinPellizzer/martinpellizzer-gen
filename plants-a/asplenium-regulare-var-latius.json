    "intro": "Asplenium regulare var. latius, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its wider, more robust fronds compared to the typical species. It is a perennial evergreen fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in temperate forests. The plant features intricate, delicate fronds with a distinctive, fern-like appearance, and its spores are released from specialized structures called sori. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread slowly through underground stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
