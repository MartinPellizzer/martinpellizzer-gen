It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, spiny bracts that enclose its small, pale yellow flowers. It produces woody capsules that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Anisoptera megistocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage and unique floral structure."
