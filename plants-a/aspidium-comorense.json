    "intro": "Aspidium comorense, commonly known as the Comorian water fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically green and slightly glossy. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or near streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Aspidium comorense plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small organisms in its native ecosystem."
