    "intro": "Astragalus ptychophyllus var. longepedunculatus, commonly known as the long pedunculate milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. This variety is notable for its distinctive elongated peduncles, which support its flowering clusters."
