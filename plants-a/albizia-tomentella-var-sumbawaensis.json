    "intro": "Albizia tomentella var. sumbawaensis, commonly known as the Sumbawa albizia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate and covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, which bloom during the dry season. Its seeds are encased in flat, leathery pods that split open to release the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in traditional medicine and as a source of timber."
