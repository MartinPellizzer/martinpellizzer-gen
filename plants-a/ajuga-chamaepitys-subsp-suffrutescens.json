    "intro": "Ajuga chamaepitys subsp. suffrutescens, commonly known as creeping bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers in early to mid-summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover."
