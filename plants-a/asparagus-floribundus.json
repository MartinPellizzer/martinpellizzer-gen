    "intro": "Asparagus floribundus, commonly known as the clustered asparagus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It features delicate, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it a versatile choice for ground cover. However, it requires careful pruning to maintain its shape and prevent it from becoming invasive."
