It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is often found in mountainous areas and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. This variation of Astragalus epiglottis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
