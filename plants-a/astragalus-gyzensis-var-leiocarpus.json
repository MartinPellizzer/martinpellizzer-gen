    "intro": "Astragalus gyzensis var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smoothpod milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces smooth, inflated pods that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. It is adapted to dry environments and has deep taproots to access groundwater, making it a hardy species in harsh conditions. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with trifoliate leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration."
