    "intro": "Astragalus suberosus subsp. suberosus, commonly known as the rough milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow to pale green flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is often found in disturbed sites, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils."
