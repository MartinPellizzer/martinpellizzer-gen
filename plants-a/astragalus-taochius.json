    "intro": "Astragalus taochius, commonly known as Chinese milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its seed pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Astragalus taochius is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits and is also used as a forage plant for livestock."
