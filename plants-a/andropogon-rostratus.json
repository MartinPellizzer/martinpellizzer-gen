    "intro": "Andropogon rostratus, commonly known as the narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces panicles of small, blue or purple flowers in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in native habitats. It is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and drought tolerance."
