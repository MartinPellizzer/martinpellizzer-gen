It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The leaves are typically ovate and have a slightly hairy surface, while the stems are hairy and often branched. This variety is distinguished by its sessile (stalkless) flowers, which are attached directly to the stem. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.",
