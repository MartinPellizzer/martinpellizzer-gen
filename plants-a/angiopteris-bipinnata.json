    "intro": "Angiopteris bipinnata, commonly known as the bipinnate water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that can reach lengths of up to several meters. The fronds are typically divided into two sets of pinnae, giving the plant its distinctive, feather-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forests. The plant plays an important ecological role in its habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing shelter for small organisms."
