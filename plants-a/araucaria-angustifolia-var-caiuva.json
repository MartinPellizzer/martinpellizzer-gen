    "intro": "Araucaria angustifolia var. caiuva, commonly known as the Caiuva Araucaria, is a rare and endemic conifer native to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and needle-like leaves that are shorter and more dense compared to the typical Araucaria angustifolia. The plant produces cyclical cones, with female cones appearing in the second year of growth and releasing seeds in the third. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Due to habitat loss, this variant is considered endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
