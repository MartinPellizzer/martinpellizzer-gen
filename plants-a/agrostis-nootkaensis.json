    "intro": "Agrostis nootkaensis, commonly known as Nootka grass, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime environments. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agrostis nootkaensis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various small invertebrates."
