It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves, which are typically leathery and have a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
