    "intro": "Aristolochia paulistana, commonly known as the Brazilian pipevine, is a climbing vine native to South America. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble pipes. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, often unpleasant odor to attract its pollinators. Its tubular flowers are typically purple or greenish in color, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
