    "intro": "Alisma plantago-aquatica f. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a wetland herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil and supports its aquatic habitat. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of the species."
