    "intro": "Argemone, commonly known as the Mexican poppy, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is characterized by its striking orange or red flowers and capsule fruits that split open to release seeds. The plant has been used historically for its oil-rich seeds, which are often processed into lamp oil or traditional remedies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Argemone is often found in arid or disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
