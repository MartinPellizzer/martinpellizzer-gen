    "intro": "Acalypha multispicata, commonly known as the red-hot catwhiskers, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, crimson bracts that resemble cat whiskers, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage. Acalypha multispicata is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties.",

The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is commonly found in desert scrublands. It is a shrub or small tree that adapts well to the harsh environmental conditions. Its native range is limited to specific regions within Mexico Southwest, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha multispicata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since become naturalized in several regions across the country. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas. Its spread has been facilitated by its ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
