    "intro": "Asparagus capensis var. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal asparagus, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. This variety is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds."
