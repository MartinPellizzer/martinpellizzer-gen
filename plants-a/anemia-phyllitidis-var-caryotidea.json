    "intro": "Anemia phyllitidis var. caryotidea, commonly known as the caryotidea fern, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are typically bright green with a waxy surface. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
