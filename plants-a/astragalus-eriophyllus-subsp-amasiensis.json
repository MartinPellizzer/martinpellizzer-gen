    "intro": "Astragalus eriophyllus subsp. amasiensis, commonly known as the Amasian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
