It is characterized by its striking blue and purple double flowers, which are typically borne on slender, branched stems. This subspecies is native to the Pyrenees Mountains and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, typical of many members of the Ranunculaceae family. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and naturalized areas."
