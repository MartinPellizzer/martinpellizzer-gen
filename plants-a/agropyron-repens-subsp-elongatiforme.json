    "intro": "Agropyron repens subsp. elongatiforme, commonly known as the elongated wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats on the ground. The leaves are typically narrow and flat, with a bluish-green coloration, and the plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and other open areas. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in restoration ecology and as a forage crop."
