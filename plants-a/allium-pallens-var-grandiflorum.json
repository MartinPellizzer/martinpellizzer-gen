    "intro": "Allium pallens var. grandiflorum, commonly known as the giant white onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of large, white, globe-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant's botanical characteristics include a bulbous stem base and a short, stout stem that supports its showy inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking, long-lasting flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
