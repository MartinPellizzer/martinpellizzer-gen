    "intro": "Adiantum sordicum, commonly known as the stinking fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically gray-green in color. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Adiantum sordicum is notable for its ability to thrive in humid conditions and its unique, slightly aromatic scent when crushed.",
