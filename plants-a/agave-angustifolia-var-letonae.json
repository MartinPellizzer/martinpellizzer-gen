    "intro": "Agave angustifolia var. letonae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, spiny leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in dry climates."
