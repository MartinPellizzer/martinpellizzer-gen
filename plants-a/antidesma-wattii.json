    "intro": "Antidesma wattii, commonly known as the African starfruit tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, rounded crown and smooth, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red, fleshy fruits that resemble starfruits, hence its common name. Antidesma wattii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is commonly found in forest understories."
