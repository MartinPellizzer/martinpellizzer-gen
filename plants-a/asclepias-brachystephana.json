    "intro": "Asclepias brachystephana, commonly known as the narrow-step milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers, which are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called corona. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Asclepias brachystephana thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds."
