    "intro": "Asplenium pedatum, commonly known as the common maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium pedatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
