    "intro": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. capitulata, commonly known as the coastal k\u014dwhai, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife species.",

This subspecies thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, scrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland environments where the climate is temperate. The plant is well adapted to the local soil and climatic conditions of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 ovina subsp. capitulata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the broader introduction of the Acaena genus for ornamental purposes. This subspecies is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. However, its spread is limited compared to other introduced Acaena species."
