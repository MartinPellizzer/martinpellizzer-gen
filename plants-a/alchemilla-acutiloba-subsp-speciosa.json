    "intro": "Alchemilla acutiloba subsp. speciosa, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and long flowering period."
