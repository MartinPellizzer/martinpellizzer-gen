    "intro": "Ammothamnus lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
