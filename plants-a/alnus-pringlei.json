    "intro": "Alnus pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and catkin-like inflorescences. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in moist, well-drained environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in riparian areas. Alnus pringlei is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
