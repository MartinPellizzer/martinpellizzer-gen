    "intro": "Asterochlaena hieronymi var. apiculata, commonly known as the Cape York rock fig, is a rare and unique plant native to the Cape York Peninsula in northern Queensland, Australia. It is a shrub characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid environment. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall. Due to its restricted range and habitat sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
