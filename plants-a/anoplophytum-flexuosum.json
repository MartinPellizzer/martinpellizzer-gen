    "intro": "Anoplophytum flexuosum, commonly known as the flexible spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and can store water in its stems and leaves. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry climates."
