    "intro": "Asplenium viviparum var. lineatum, commonly known as the linear spleenwort, is a fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, linear fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its unique morphology and reproductive structures make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
