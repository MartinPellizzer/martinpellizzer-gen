    "intro": "Adicea hyalina, commonly known as the glassy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its translucent, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the flowers are small and often pale in color. Adicea hyalina is a carnivorous plant that relies on both photosynthesis and the absorption of nutrients from captured prey.",
