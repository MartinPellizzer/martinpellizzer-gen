    "intro": "Acalypha zollingeri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red hot catwhiskers, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble cat whiskers, which are often more showy than the small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its leaves are usually ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Acalypha zollingeri thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha zollingeri is primarily native to the Lesser Sunda Islands. This plant is found in the Indonesian archipelago, specifically in regions such as Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, and Flores. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The species is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution is limited to these specific islands, reflecting its ecological preferences and geographic isolation.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha zollingeri was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It has been cultivated in gardens and landscapes, particularly in regions with warm climates. However, it has also become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems. Its spread has been documented in several southern states, raising concerns among environmentalists and land managers. Efforts are being made to control its distribution and prevent further ecological damage."
