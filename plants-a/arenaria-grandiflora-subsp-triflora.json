    "intro": "Arenaria grandiflora subsp. triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and rocky environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas with high sunlight exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
