    "intro": "Adesmia friesii, commonly known as the Mexican thornbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and thorny stems. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. Adesmia friesii is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to stabilize soil.",
