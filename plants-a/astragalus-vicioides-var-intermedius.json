    "intro": "Astragalus vicioides var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
