    "intro": "Asclepias revoluta, commonly known as the spiral milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both the larvae and adult insects. Asclepias revoluta is also known for its latex-like sap, which contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores."
