    "intro": "Aulomyrcia subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Loranthaceae. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Eucalyptus*, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers. Its fruit is a small capsule that contains seeds with a sticky coating, which aids in attachment to the host. Aulomyrcia subcordata is native to southeastern Australia and is often found in coastal and dry forest habitats."
