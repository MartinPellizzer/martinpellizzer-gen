It is characterized by its deeply lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, with shallow furrows that become more pronounced with age.
