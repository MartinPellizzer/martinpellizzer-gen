    "intro": "Astragalus marschallianus, commonly known as the Marshall's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with numerous leaflets, and its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Astragalus marschallianus plays a role in soil stabilization and is part of the diverse flora of its native habitats."
