    "intro": "Agauria, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Agauria has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule-like fruits that contain seeds with a unique, waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Agauria is considered a rare and endangered species."
