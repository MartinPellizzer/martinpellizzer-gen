    "intro": "Alchemilla alpigena f. silicicola, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, silvery-green leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are covered with a fine layer of silica, giving them a gritty texture and contributing to its common name. This variety is adapted to rocky, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
