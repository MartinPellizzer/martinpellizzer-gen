It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the Atlantic coastline. This plant is commonly found in dune environments and coastal grasslands. It is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthodium capense var. inermis was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is known for its distinctive, spiny leaves and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. It has been observed in both natural and cultivated settings, contributing to local biodiversity. However, its introduction status remains unclear, as it may be either native or non-native to certain areas."
