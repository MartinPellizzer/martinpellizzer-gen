    "intro": "Aconitum delphiniifolium var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered delphiniifolium aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stem and large, deeply lobed, palmately compound leaves that resemble the leaves of the delphinium plant. The flowers are arranged in a raceme and are notable for their striking white color, which contrasts with the dark green foliage. This variety is known for its ornamental value in gardens and its association with the broader Aconitum genus, which contains many species with toxic alkaloids. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats.",
