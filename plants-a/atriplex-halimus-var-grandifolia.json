    "intro": "Atriplex halimus var. grandifolia, commonly known as the large-leaved saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on branched inflorescences. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it a common species in coastal and semi-arid areas. Its robust growth habit and drought tolerance make it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
