    "intro": "Aira atropurpurea, commonly known as purple air plant, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that turn a striking purple or reddish hue in full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences topped with tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color and delicate floral display."
