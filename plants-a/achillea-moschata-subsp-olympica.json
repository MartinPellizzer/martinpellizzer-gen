    "intro": "Achillea moschata subsp. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic yarrow, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It features upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, silvery-gray pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its aromatic foliage and showy flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, exhibiting drought tolerance once established.",
