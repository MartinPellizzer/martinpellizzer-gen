    "intro": "Asteriscus spinosus var. aureus, commonly known as the golden spiny aster, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, spiny foliage with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly rough texture. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
