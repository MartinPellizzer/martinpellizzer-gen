    "intro": "Avena pusilla, commonly known as dwarf oat, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, with slender stems and delicate, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a decorative plant."
