    "intro": "Antennaria albescens, commonly known as the white mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, and its foliage consists of finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and ability to spread via stolons. Antennaria albescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
