    "intro": "Allomaieta zenufanasana, commonly known as the Zenufan Starleaf, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped leaves that reflect a metallic sheen under sunlight. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pale blue and purple during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
