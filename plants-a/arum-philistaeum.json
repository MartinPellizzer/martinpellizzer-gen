It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its distinctive inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered around the spadix, which is typically covered in a dense mass of tiny, bisexual flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams or in woodland areas. The plant's leaves are arrow-shaped and can grow up to 30 centimeters in length, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
