    "intro": "Anoectochilus elongatus, commonly known as the elongated helmet orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stem and elongated, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a raceme, with petals and sepals that are narrowly elliptic in shape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
