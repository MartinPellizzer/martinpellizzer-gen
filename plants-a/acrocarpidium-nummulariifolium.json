    "intro": "Acrocarpidium nummulariifolium, commonly known as the shield-leaf moss, is a small, low-growing moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a rosette-like growth form with leaves that are broadly ovate and often covered in a thick layer of papillae. The plant produces spore capsules that are typically borne on short, erect stems called setae. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to soil stabilization in its habitat.",
