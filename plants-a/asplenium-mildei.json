    "intro": "Asplenium mildei, commonly known as the Milde's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a glossy appearance. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium mildei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
