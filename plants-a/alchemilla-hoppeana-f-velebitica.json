    "intro": "Alchemilla hoppeana f. velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit alkanet, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Velebit mountain range in Croatia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in dense, compact inflorescences during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
