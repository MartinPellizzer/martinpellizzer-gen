    "intro": "Astragalus aristatus var. canescens, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender stems covered in a dense layer of white, silky hairs. The leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that are also hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Its flowers are usually pale purple to white, clustered in dense, spherical heads, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is adapted to poor soils and is often found in steppe, grassland, and disturbed sites."
