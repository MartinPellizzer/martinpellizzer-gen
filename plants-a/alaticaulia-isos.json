    "intro": "Alaticaulia isos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alpine shrub, is a hardy plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features slender, upright stems with small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often blooming in late spring or early summer. Alaticaulia isos is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found growing in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its growth habit and floral structure make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
