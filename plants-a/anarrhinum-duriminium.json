    "intro": "Anarrhinum duriminium, commonly known as the desert spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through its ability to store water in its stems and leaves. It produces a milky sap that can be toxic to animals and humans. Anarrhinum duriminium plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
