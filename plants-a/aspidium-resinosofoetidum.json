    "intro": "Aspidium resinosofoetidum, commonly known as the stinking fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy, resinous coating, which gives it a distinctive, unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium resinosofoetidum is native to parts of Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
