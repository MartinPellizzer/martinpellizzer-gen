    "intro": "Atamasco pulchella, commonly known as the showy atamasco, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or wetland habitats. It produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. Atamasco pulchella is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
