    "intro": "Ampelocissus divaricata, commonly known as the African climbing fig, is a woody vine native to southern Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple tinge. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by edible, fig-like fruits that are typically green when mature. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its climbing habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
