    "intro": "Abutilon tortuosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Chinese lantern plant, is a species of flowering plant in the mallow family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, lantern-like flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The fruit is a dry capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon tortuosum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is also found in parts of tropical regions in Africa, such as Kenya and Tanzania. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates and is commonly found in coastal areas and lowland forests. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed soils in its native habitat. Abutilon tortuosum is known for its distinctive, lantern-shaped flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tortuosum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was initially brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. However, it has since spread rapidly, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed areas and is particularly problematic in coastal and lowland habitats. Its introduction has led to increased management efforts to control its spread and protect native biodiversity."
