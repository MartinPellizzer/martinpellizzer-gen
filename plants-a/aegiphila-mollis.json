    "intro": "Aegiphila mollis, commonly known as the silverleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in spring. Aegiphila mollis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and resilient to harsh conditions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings."
