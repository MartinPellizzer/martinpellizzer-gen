    "intro": "Abies spectabilis var. langtangensis, commonly known as the Langtang fir, is a rare variant of the blue fir native to the Himalayan region. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a single row along the stems. The cones of this species are typically cylindrical and have a distinctive, woody structure. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range.",

It is commonly found in the Langtang Valley and surrounding areas of Nepal. This variety thrives in high-altitude temperate forests, typically at elevations between 2,500 and 4,000 meters. It is adapted to cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. The plant plays an important ecological role in these mountainous regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies spectabilis var. langtangensis was mainly introduced to the Langtang National Park in Nepal. It is a variant of the silver fir, known for its distinctive silver-blue foliage. This plant is adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in cool, moist conditions. It plays a vital role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its introduction has contributed to the biodiversity and ecological stability of the region."
