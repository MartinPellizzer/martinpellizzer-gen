    "intro": "Athrixia pinifolia, commonly known as the needleleaf lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a dark green to blackish upper surface with a distinctive, leaf-like structure. The thallus is leathery and often covered with tiny, hair-like structures called rhizines. It is typically found on bark, soil, or rocks in temperate forests. This lichen plays a vital role in nutrient cycling and serves as an indicator of environmental conditions."
