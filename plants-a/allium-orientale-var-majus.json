    "intro": "Allium orientale var. majus, commonly known as the giant leek, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features a tall, slender stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, topped with a dense cluster of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces umbels of white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous base is edible, similar to garlic and leeks, and is used in various culinary traditions. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to gardens."
