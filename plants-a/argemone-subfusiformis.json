It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open to release the seeds, aiding in its dispersal."
