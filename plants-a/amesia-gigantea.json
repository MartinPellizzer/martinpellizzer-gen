It features showy, daisy-like flowers with white to pale pink petals and yellow centers, blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed, contributing to its distinctive scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry meadows and rocky habitats.
