    "intro": "Asplenium thwaitesianum, commonly known as the Thwaites' spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on the bark of trees or rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium thwaitesianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
