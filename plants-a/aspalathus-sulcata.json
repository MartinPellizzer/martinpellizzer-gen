    "intro": "Aspalathus sulcata, commonly known as the African tea or rooibos, is a small shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are the primary part used for commercial purposes, harvested and processed to produce the popular herbal tea. Aspalathus sulcata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
