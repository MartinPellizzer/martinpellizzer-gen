    "intro": "Arenaria armerina var. caesia, commonly known as the blue sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is distinguished by its more intense blue coloration compared to other forms of Arenaria armerina."
