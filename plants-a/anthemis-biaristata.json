    "intro": "Anthemis biaristata, commonly known as the Sierra Madre everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flower heads that are often mistaken for single flowers, but they consist of many tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural wild environment."
