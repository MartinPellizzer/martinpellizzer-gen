It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Agrostis lanceolata is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
