    "intro": "Astragalus palenae var. grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and supports local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
