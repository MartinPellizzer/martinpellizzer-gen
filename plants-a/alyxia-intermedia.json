    "intro": "Alyxia intermedia, commonly known as the yellow mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a slight pubescence, contributing to its ornamental value. Alyxia intermedia is also valued for its ability to provide habitat and food for various wildlife species."
