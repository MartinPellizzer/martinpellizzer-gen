    "intro": "Anisopappus lastii subsp. welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaping and conservation efforts."
