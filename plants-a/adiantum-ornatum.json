    "intro": "Adiantum ornatum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that resemble flowing hair, giving it its common name. The plant has a distinctive, upright growth habit with a short, thick rhizome that supports its feathery foliage. Its fronds are bi-lobed and have a unique, almost translucent appearance when mature. Adiantum ornatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas.",
