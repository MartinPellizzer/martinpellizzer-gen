    "intro": "Aetanthus engelsii, commonly known as the Engels' sandmat, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small white flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces a unique seed structure known as a schizocarp, which splits into two parts when mature. Aetanthus engelsii is often found in coastal and inland dune habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these regions."
