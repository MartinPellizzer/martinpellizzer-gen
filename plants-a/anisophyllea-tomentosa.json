    "intro": "Anisophyllea tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly anisophyllea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by round, fleshy fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
