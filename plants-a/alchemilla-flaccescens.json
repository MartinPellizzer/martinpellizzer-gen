    "intro": "Alchemilla flaccescens, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky areas. Alchemilla flaccescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
