    "intro": "Aerangis ellisii var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered aerangis, is a rare and striking orchid native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, forming compact clumps with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
