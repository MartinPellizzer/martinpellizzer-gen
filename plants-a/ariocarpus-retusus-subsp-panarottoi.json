    "intro": "Ariocarpus retusus subsp. panarottoi, commonly known as the Panarotto's prickly pear, is a rare and striking cactus native to the Chihuahua Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, red fruits. It thrives in arid environments with well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
