It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Amerosedum subalpinum is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
