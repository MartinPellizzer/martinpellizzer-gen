    "intro": "Arenaria serpens var. orizabae, commonly known as the Orizaba sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or mountainous habitats."
