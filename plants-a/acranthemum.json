    "intro": "Acranthemum, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. These plants are typically found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and stream sides, across temperate regions. They are characterized by their hairy stems, opposite leaves, and small, often blue or violet flowers. Acranthemum species are perennial herbs that often form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland ecosystems. Their flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, enhancing their role in supporting local biodiversity."
