    "intro": "Aristea lignosa, commonly known as the hardy arrowhead, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for both gardeners and botanists."
