It is characterized by its vibrant red to orange foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental species. The tree has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that turn brilliant colors in the fall. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown when young, becoming fissured with age.",
