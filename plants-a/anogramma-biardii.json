    "intro": "Anogramma biardii, commonly known as the biard's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. Anogramma biardii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
