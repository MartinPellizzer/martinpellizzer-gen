    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon cunninghamii is primarily native to Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native range. It plays an important role in the local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon cunninghamii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as part of the broader introduction of ornamental plants. The species has since naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and along riverbanks where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. However, its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
