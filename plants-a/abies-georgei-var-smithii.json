    "intro": "Abies georgei var. smithii, commonly known as the Smith's fir, is a variant of the George fir, native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern China. It is a coniferous evergreen tree characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and dark green, needle-like leaves. The cones are typically small and reddish-brown, maturing to a darker hue. This species thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in high-altitude forests. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies georgei var. smithii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, specifically China, Japan, and Korea. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high elevations, often found in forested areas with well-drained soils. This variety is commonly associated with the Korean Peninsula, where it grows in the foothills and montane zones of the country. It is also present in parts of northeastern China, particularly in the provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in isolated populations.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies georgei var. smithii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is commonly found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas. This variety is known for its attractive silver-blue foliage and pyramidal shape. It is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its aesthetic appeal. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
