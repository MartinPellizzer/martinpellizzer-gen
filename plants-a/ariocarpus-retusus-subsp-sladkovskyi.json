    "intro": "Ariocarpus retusus subsp. sladkovskyi, commonly known as the Sladkovsky's prickly pear, is a rare cactus species native to the Mexican state of Coahuila. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems covered in white, woolly hair, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, edible fruits. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
