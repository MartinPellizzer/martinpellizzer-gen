    "intro": "Androcorys monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf androcorys, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its single, broad, waxy leaf that persists throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers in the summer, which are clustered in a loose inflorescence. Its botanical features include a short, rhizomatous stem and a preference for moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
