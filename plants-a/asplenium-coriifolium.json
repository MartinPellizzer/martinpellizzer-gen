    "intro": "Asplenium coriifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in crevices. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. This species is relatively uncommon and is often considered a relic of ancient plant communities."
