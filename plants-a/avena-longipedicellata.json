    "intro": "Avena longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-awned oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its long awns, which are bristle-like structures, give it its common name and aid in seed dispersal. Avena longipedicellata is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands."
