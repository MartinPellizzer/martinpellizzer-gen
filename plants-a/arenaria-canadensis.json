    "intro": "Arenaria canadensis, commonly known as Canadian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. The plant features small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid conditions. Arenaria canadensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
