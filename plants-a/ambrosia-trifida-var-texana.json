    "intro": "Ambrosia trifida var. texana, commonly known as the giant ragweed, is a tall annual plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, triangular leaves with serrated edges and yellow-green flowers that appear in late summer. The plant produces copious amounts of small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its invasive potential in many regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in agricultural fields. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a significant nuisance in some areas."
