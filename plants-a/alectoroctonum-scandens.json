    "intro": "Alectoroctonum scandens, commonly known as the climbing nightshade, is a flowering plant belonging to the Solanaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often twining. This species is notable for its toxic properties, containing alkaloids that can be harmful to humans and animals."
