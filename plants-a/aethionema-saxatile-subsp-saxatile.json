    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile subsp. saxatile, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky areas of the Mediterranean region. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
