    "intro": "Alsine catarctarum, commonly known as the yellow sandparsley, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Alsine catarctarum is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to thrive in harsh, sandy environments."
