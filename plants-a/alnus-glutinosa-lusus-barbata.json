It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often near water bodies. The plant is characterized by its small, elongated leaves with a distinctive barbed margin, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are catkins, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
