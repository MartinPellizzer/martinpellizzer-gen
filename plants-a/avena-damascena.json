    "intro": "Avena damascena, commonly known as the Spanish needle or goatweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, branching stems that grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by feathery, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a soft, hairy texture. Avena damascena thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas."
