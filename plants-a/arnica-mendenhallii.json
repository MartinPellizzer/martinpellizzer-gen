    "intro": "Arnica mendenhallii, commonly known as Mendenhall's arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. It has a short, stout stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
