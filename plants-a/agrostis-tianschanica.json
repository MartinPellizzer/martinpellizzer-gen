    "intro": "Agrostis tianschanica, commonly known as the Tian Shan needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as the Tian Shan and Pamir mountain ranges, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Agrostis tianschanica plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
