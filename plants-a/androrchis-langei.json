    "intro": "Androrchis langei, commonly known as the Lange's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its intricate, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as purple and white. The plant grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, often in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the thin soil of its environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
