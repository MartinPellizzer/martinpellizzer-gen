    "intro": "Apodytes dimidiata var. ikongoensis, commonly known as the Ikombo apricot, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of western Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round fruits that resemble apricots, with a sweet, edible pulp and a single hard seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary growth areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
