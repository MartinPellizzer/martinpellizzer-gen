    "intro": "Androsace cephalantha, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features a dense rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered at the center of the rosette. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Androsace cephalantha is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
