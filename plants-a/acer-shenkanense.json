    "intro": "Acer shenkanense, commonly known as the Korean maple, is a deciduous tree native to the Korean Peninsula. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks.",
