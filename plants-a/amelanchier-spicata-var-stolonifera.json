    "intro": "Amelanchier spicata var. stolonifera, commonly known as the stoloniferous serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit due to its stoloniferous nature, which allows it to spread via horizontal stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of white to pink flowers in early spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sun, making it a versatile addition to native plant gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and autumn coloration."
