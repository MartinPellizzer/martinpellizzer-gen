    "intro": "Acacia hockii, commonly known as the golden wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. Acacia hockii is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is the national floral emblem of Australia. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia hockii is primarily native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in lowland areas, often growing in disturbed or secondary forests, as well as along roadsides and in open woodlands. The plant thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal or riverine environments. It is also present in parts of northern Australia, where it has been introduced and naturalized. Acacia hockii is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and its ability to form dense thickets, making it an important component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia hockii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in various soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivation and is now considered a weed in some regions, particularly in coastal and urban areas. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it a potential ecological threat. Its introduction has led to management efforts to control its spread in natural habitats. Despite its invasive potential, Acacia hockii remains popular in horticulture for its aesthetic value."
