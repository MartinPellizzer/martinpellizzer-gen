    "intro": "Asplenium ruta-muraria var. tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock fern, is a variant of the common rock fern, characterized by its slender, linear leaves. It is a perennial fern that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a compact growth habit with closely spaced fronds that form a rosette-like structure. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its preferred habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic or neutral soil conditions."
