    "intro": "Aeluropus erythraeus, commonly known as the red sandflat grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass that thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and sandy shores. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems. Aeluropus erythraeus plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in its habitat."
