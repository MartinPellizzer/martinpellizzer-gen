    "intro": "Albizia pseudosaponaria, commonly known as the Indian velvet tamarind, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Albizia pseudosaponaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
