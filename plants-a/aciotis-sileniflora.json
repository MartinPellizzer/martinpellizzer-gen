    "intro": "Aciotis sileniflora, commonly known as the silversword, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces a tall, flowering stalk that bears numerous yellow flowers, which bloom in the early morning. Aciotis sileniflora is adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat, including high altitudes and volcanic soils. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in its native range.",
