It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that resemble a hood, hence its common name. The plant has dark green, palmately divided leaves and produces showy, spicate inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and requires careful handling.",
