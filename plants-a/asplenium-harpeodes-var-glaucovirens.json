    "intro": "Asplenium harpeodes var. glaucovirens, commonly known as the glaucovirens fern, is a variant of the rock fern genus Asplenium. It is characterized by its distinctive, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green with a bluish-white underside. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or calcareous soils. Its spores are produced in compact, club-like structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
