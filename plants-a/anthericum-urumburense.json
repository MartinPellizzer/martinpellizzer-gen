    "intro": "Anthericum urumburense, commonly known as the Urumburi lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and slightly curled at the edges, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
