    "intro": "Arenaria marginata, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with small, succulent leaves. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Arenaria marginata plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
