    "intro": "Acaena lucida f. inermis, commonly known as the glabrous spinach bush, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, hairy leaves that are often clustered around the stems, and its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters.

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena lucida f. inermis is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the North Island and parts of the South Island. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops. It is adapted to harsh, windy conditions and poor soils. It is an important component of the local flora in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena lucida f. inermis was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soils in disturbed areas. It is commonly used in restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, including its bright yellow flowers and persistent fruits. However, it has the potential to become invasive in some regions if not managed properly. Its distribution is primarily limited to areas where it has been intentionally planted for ecological or aesthetic purposes."
