    "intro": "Angolluma ubomboensis, commonly known as the Ubombo ghostflower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and delicate, bioluminescent flowers that glow faintly in the dark. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high salinity and strong coastal winds. Its unique biological features make it a subject of interest for botanists studying adaptation to extreme environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
