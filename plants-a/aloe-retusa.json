    "intro": "Aloe retusa, commonly known as the smooth aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered with a waxy coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in summer. Aloe retusa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid climates. Its gel is often used in skincare products due to its soothing properties."
