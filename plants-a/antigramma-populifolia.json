    "intro": "Antigramma populifolia, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, pinnate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. The tree's most notable feature is its unique, woody capsule that contains the edible seeds, which are harvested for their nutritional value. It thrives in humid, lowland rainforest environments and plays a crucial role in local ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is also considered a threatened species."
