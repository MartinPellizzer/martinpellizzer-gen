    "intro": "Airopsis agrostidea var. vivipara, commonly known as the viviparous sea lettuce, is a marine green alga found in intertidal zones. It belongs to the family Ulvaceae and is characterized by its filamentous thallus that forms dense, turfy growths. The plant exhibits viviparity, producing reproductive structures that develop while still attached to the parent plant. It thrives in shallow, saline waters and is often found in association with other algae and coastal vegetation. Its morphology and reproductive strategy make it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
