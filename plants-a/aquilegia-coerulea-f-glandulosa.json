    "intro": "Aquilegia coerulea f. glandulosa, commonly known as the blue monk's hood, is a distinctive member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, spurred blue or purple flowers that resemble a hood, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are palmately compound, with finely divided, fern-like lobes that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The f. glandulosa form is notable for its glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which may play a role in deterring herbivores."
