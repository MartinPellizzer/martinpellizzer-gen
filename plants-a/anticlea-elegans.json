It belongs to the Convolvulaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces violet to blue flowers that bloom in the morning, hence its common name. Anticlea elegans is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in moist, shady environments. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a notable species in ecological studies."
