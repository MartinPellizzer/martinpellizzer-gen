    "intro": "Asperula rivalis, commonly known as the alpine azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Asperula rivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to shaded landscapes."
