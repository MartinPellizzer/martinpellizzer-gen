    "intro": "Agrostis albimontana, commonly known as the white mountain grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, white to pale green flowers. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of high-altitude environments."
