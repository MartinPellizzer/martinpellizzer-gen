    "intro": "Astragalus oniciformis, commonly known as the horned milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like seed pods. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, rounded seeds that are dispersed by wind. Astragalus oniciformis is often found in steppe and desert environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
