    "intro": "Astragalus psilacanthus subsp. pseudopsilocentros, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in raceme inflorescences, which are typically followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to dry environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
