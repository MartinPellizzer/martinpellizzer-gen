    "intro": "Aethionema saxatile var. marginatum, commonly known as the pink rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and features small, bright pink or white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically lobed and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive marginated leaves, which have a pale edge, adding to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
