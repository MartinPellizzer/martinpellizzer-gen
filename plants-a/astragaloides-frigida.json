    "intro": "Astragaloides frigida, commonly known as the cold-tolerant milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
