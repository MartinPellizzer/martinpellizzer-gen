    "intro": "Aerides larpentae, commonly known as the Larpent's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants rather than in soil. Aerides larpentae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
