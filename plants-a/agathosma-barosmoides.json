    "intro": "Agathosma barosmoides, commonly known as Cape garlic or wild garlic, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the fynbos biome of South Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, rounded, fleshy fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to nutrient-poor, acidic soils and thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its aromatic leaves, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
