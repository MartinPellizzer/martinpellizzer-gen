    "intro": "Armeria labradorica f. pubiscapa, commonly known as the Labrador sea thrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the rocky coastal areas of Labrador. It features dense clusters of small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. This cultivar is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
