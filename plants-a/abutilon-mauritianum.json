It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions across these countries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. It is also known for its ornamental value due to its hairy leaves and showy flowers. Its native range spans a wide geographic area in sub-Saharan Africa.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mauritianum was mainly introduced to Hawaii, where it has become an invasive species. It was originally from Madagascar and was likely brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy flowers. The plant thrives in tropical climates and has spread aggressively in native forests and coastal areas. It competes with native plants for resources and can alter ecosystem dynamics. Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a major threat to Hawaii's native biodiversity."
