    "intro": "Astronidium montanum, commonly known as the mountain astronidium, is a small evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
