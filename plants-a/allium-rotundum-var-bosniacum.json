    "intro": "Allium rotundum var. bosniacum, commonly known as the Bosnian garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its rounded, fleshy bulbs and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces umbels of white to pinkish flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its bulbs are used in traditional medicine and cuisine, valued for their pungent aroma and potential health benefits. However, it is less commonly cultivated than other Allium species due to its specific growing requirements."
