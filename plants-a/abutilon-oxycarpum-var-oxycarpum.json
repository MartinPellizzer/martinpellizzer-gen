    "intro": "Abutilon oxycarpum var. oxycarpum, commonly known as the velvetleaf abutilon, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces showy, lantern-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its fruits are small, round capsules that split open to release seeds. The plant is often grown as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and vibrant floral display.",

This plant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions across these states. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. The species is well adapted to the climatic conditions of the Australian interior. It plays an important ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon oxycarpum var. oxycarpum was mainly introduced to New Caledonia. It is a variant of the species Abutilon oxycarpum, which is native to South America. The introduction of this plant to New Caledonia likely occurred through human activity, such as horticultural trade or accidental transport. It has since become established in the region, adapting to the local climate and ecosystems. This plant is now considered an introduced species in New Caledonia, contributing to the area's botanical diversity."
