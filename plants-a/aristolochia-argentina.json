    "intro": "Aristolochia argentina, commonly known as the Argentine Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, aromatic leaves and distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, musty odor. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in some regions despite its poisonous nature."
