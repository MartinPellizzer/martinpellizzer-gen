    "intro": "Andrachne gracilipes, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its growth habit is often prostrate, with stems that spread along the ground. Andrachne gracilipes plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic adaptations."
