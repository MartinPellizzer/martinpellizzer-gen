    "intro": "Acaena echinata, commonly known as the bristly acaena, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, thorn-like stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits. Its hairy foliage and robust structure make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Acaena echinata is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena echinata is primarily native to New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, and Western Australia. This plant is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas, sand dunes, and dry shrublands. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with coastal and inland regions. The species is well adapted to the temperate and Mediterranean climates of these areas. Its native distribution reflects its ability to survive in diverse environmental conditions across southern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena echinata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is often considered an invasive species due to its ability to spread rapidly. However, it also plays a role in stabilizing soils in certain environments."
