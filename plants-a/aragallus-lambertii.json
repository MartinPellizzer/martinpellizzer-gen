    "intro": "Aragallus lambertii, commonly known as the Lambert's aragallus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in remote, inaccessible areas. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare and beautiful species from threats such as habitat loss and climate change."
