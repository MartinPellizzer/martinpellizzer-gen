    "intro": "Andromeda jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican andromeda, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its flowers are usually pink or white, and it produces small, dark berries that are edible but not widely consumed by humans. Andromeda jamaicensis plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small animals."
