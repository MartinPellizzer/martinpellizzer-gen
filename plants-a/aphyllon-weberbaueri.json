    "intro": "Aphyllon weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's leafless plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its absence of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its green, cylindrical stems. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. Due to its specialized morphology, it is adapted to cold, dry environments and is considered a rare and delicate species."
