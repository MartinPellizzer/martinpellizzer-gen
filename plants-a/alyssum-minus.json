    "intro": "Alyssum minus, commonly known as sweet alyssum, is a low-growing, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage with a slightly fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Alyssum minus is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
