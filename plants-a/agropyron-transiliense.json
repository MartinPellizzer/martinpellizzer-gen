    "intro": "Agropyron transiliense, commonly known as the Transilian needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brownish florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Agropyron transiliense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
