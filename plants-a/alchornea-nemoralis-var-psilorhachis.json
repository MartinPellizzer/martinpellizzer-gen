    "intro": "Alchornea nemoralis var. psilorhachis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf alchornea, is a shrub native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, featuring slender, often hairy stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-lobed, hairy capsules as its fruit. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or scrub habitats. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
