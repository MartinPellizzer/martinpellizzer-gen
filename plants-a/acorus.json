    "intro": "Acorus, commonly known as sweet flag, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and distinctive, often fragrant, spadix surrounded by a spathe. Acorus species are typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in wet habitats. It is also noted for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
