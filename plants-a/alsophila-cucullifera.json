    "intro": "Alsophila cucullifera, commonly known as the shield fern, is a species of tree fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, shield-shaped fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a distinctive crown of fronds that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. Its rhizome is thick and woody, supporting the plant's upright growth. Alsophila cucullifera prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests."
