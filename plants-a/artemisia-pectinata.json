    "intro": "Artemisia pectinata, commonly known as silver wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, hair-like structures called peltate glands. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are typically clustered in panicles, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Artemisia pectinata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Its aromatic leaves also make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in dry climates."
