    "intro": "Allium maniaticum, commonly known as the woolly leek, is a perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its bulbous stem and broad, grass-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Allium maniaticum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and can also be grown as a culinary herb."
