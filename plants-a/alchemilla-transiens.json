It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Alchemilla transiens is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas. Its common name reflects its transient blooming period and the delicate appearance of its foliage."
