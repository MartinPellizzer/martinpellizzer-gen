It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red or orange berries in the fall. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates.",
