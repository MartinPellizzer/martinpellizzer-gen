    "intro": "Avena caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina oatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands, marshes, and roadside ditches. The plant has slender, hairless stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a dense mat. Its small, spike-like inflorescence bears numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue, contributing to its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
