    "intro": "Androsace pedunculata, commonly known as the mountain mouse-ear, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, and the flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. Androsace pedunculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
