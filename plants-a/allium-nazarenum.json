    "intro": "Allium nazarenum, commonly known as the Nazarene garlic, is a flowering plant native to the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its bulbous stem and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces a garlic-like odor when the leaves are crushed, which is due to the presence of sulfur compounds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Allium nazarenum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in traditional herbal medicine."
