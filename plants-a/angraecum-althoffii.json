It is characterized by its long, slender stems and large, showy white flowers with prominent green veins. The plant produces its flowers during the dry season, typically in the winter months, and relies on specific pollinators such as the hawkmoth. Angraecum althoffii thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
