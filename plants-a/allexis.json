    "intro": "Allexis, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its compact, drought-resistant structure and vibrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant belongs to the Acanthaceae family and thrives in well-drained soil with minimal water. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Allexis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and low maintenance requirements."
