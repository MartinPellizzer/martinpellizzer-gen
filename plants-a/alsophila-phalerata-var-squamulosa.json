It is characterized by its distinctive, silvery, scale-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant is native to parts of Southeast Asia and thrives in humid, tropical environments. It has a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a mass of persistent, fibrous roots. The fronds are usually arranged in a dense, fan-like pattern at the top of the trunk."
