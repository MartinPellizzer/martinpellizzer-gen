    "intro": "Appendicula humilis, commonly known as the dwarf appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Appendicula humilis is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its unique morphology and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
