    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 paui, commonly known as the Paul's horse chestnut, is a hybrid deciduous tree resulting from the cross between the American chestnut (Acer negundo) and the horse chestnut (Acer hippocastanum). It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces showy, white to pinkish flowers in spring, followed by spiny, spherical fruits containing one or two seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. However, it is not typically used for timber or fruit production.",
