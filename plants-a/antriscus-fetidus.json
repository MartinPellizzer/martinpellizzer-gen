    "intro": "Antriscus fetidus, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, and its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture. It is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is released when the leaves are crushed. Despite its pungent scent, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural dyes."
