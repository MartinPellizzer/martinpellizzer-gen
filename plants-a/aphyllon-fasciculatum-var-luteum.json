It is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and yellowish-green fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing cones, are located at the base of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
