It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as slopes and gravelly soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus waterfallii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
