    "intro": "Acantholimon wendelboi, commonly known as the Wendelbo's thornscale, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plumbagaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Mediterranean, particularly in Cyprus and Turkey. The plant is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing at higher elevations. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of these regions. Its native distribution is limited to specific areas within Iran, reflecting its ecological preferences.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon wendelboi was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. It is typically found in regions with cool, temperate climates and moderate precipitation. This plant prefers well-drained soil and is often associated with mountainous or coastal habitats. Its introduction has been noted in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. It is considered a rare and specialized species with limited distribution."
