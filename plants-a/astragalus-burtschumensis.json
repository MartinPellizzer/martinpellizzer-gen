    "intro": "Astragalus burtschumensis, commonly known as Burt's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, hairy pods that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
