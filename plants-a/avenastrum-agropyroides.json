    "intro": "Avenastrum agropyroides, commonly known as goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and delicate, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Avenastrum agropyroides is considered a low-growing perennial, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion."
