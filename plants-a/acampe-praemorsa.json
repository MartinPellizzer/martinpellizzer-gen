    "intro": "Acampe praemorsa, commonly known as the death's-head hawkmoth, is a striking plant characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, bioluminescent flowers. Native to South Africa, it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to conserve water. The plant's flowers emit a strong, sweet scent at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. Acampe praemorsa is also notable for its ability to produce toxic compounds that deter herbivores.",

This plant is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. It is typically associated with forest understories and is often found in areas with high humidity. Acampe praemorsa is well adapted to the diverse climates and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution spans across several Southeast Asian and South Asian countries, reflecting its ecological versatility.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe praemorsa was mainly introduced to Cuba. It is considered an invasive species in the region, outcompeting native plants for resources. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and spread pose a threat to local biodiversity. Efforts are being made to control its distribution and prevent further ecological impact."
