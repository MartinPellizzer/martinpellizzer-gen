    "intro": "Agrostis violacea, commonly known as violet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a violet hue. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually pale green to purple, adding a subtle ornamental quality. Agrostis violacea is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
