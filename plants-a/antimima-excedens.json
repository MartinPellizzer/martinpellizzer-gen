    "intro": "Antimima excedens, commonly known as the giant ant plant, is a unique species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ant-like structures that resemble the bodies of ants, which are actually modified leaves. The plant's botanical features include its ability to produce nectar, attracting various insects and small animals. Its growth habit is typically epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. Antimima excedens plays a role in its ecosystem by providing shelter and food for small organisms."
