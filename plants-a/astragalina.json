    "intro": "Astragalina, commonly known as milkvetch, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often thriving in sandy or rocky soils. They are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Astragalina species are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in ecological restoration. Many species within this genus are also used in traditional medicine and as forage for livestock."
