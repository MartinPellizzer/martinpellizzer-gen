    "intro": "Acer serotinum, commonly known as late maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring before its foliage emerges. Its seeds are enclosed in samaras, which are winged fruits that aid in wind dispersal. Acer serotinum typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
