    "intro": "Alnus incana f. argyrophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf alder, is a variant of the alder tree characterized by its silvery-gray foliage. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States, particularly in mountainous regions. The leaves are elliptical, hairy, and have a distinctive silvery-white underside, which gives the plant its common name. It produces small, cone-like fruits that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and forest edges."
