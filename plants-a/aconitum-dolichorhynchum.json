    "intro": "Aconitum dolichorhynchum, commonly known as the long-beaked monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers. The plant features palmately lobed leaves and produces toxic alkaloids, making it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its ornamental value is significant, though caution is necessary due to its potent toxicity.",
