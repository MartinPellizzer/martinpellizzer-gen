    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena longifolia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the southern and western regions of the country. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is well adapted to the temperate climate and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Acaena longifolia plays an important role in the local ecosystem, providing food and habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena longifolia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially planted for ornamental purposes due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in some areas. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists in New Zealand."
