    "intro": "Abutilon verbascoides, commonly known as the Indian mallow or velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and showy, lantern-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its fibrous roots and branching stems make it adaptable to various soil types, while its rapid growth rate allows it to thrive in disturbed habitats. Abutilon verbascoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon verbascoides is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. This plant is commonly found in regions with a temperate to subtropical climate. It is well adapted to arid conditions and can tolerate poor soil quality. Its native range is largely concentrated in the southern parts of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon verbascoides was mainly introduced to North America, particularly in the United States and Canada, as an ornamental plant due to its showy, lantern-shaped flowers. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and along riverbanks. The plant has also been reported in parts of Europe and Australia, where it has occasionally become naturalized. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. Despite its ornamental value, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
