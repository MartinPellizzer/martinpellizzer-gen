    "intro": "Airosperma psychotrioides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant produces striking, delicate white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the humid air. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
