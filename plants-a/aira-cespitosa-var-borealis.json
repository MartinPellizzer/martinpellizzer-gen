    "intro": "Aira cespitosa var. borealis, commonly known as the northern false oat, is a perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It forms dense, low-growing clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces slender, spike-like flower clusters. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its reproductive structures are wind-pollinated, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments. The species is characterized by its compact growth habit and resilience to extreme weather conditions."
