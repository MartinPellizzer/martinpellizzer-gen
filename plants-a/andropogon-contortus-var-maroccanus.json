    "intro": "Andropogon contortus var. maroccanus, commonly known as the Moroccan twisted grass, is a perennial grass native to North Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, twisted leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
