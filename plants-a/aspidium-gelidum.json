    "intro": "Aspidium gelidum, commonly known as the cold fern, is a species of fern native to the cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bi- or tri-pinnate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are released from the sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium gelidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
