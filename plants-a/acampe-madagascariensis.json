    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acampe madagascariensis is primarily native to Madagascar. It is found in the eastern and northern parts of the island, where the climate is humid and tropical. This plant typically grows in forested areas and along riverbanks. It is adapted to the rich, moist soils of these regions. Due to its restricted range, it is considered a endemic species of Madagascar.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acampe madagascariensis was mainly introduced to Madagascar as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and adaptability to tropical climates. It has since spread to other parts of the island, particularly in disturbed habitats and along roadsides. The plant's rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil types have contributed to its widespread distribution. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native flora and ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, efforts are being made to monitor and manage its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
