    "intro": "Androsace chamaejasme var. uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower rock jasmine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a dense mat of prostrate stems covered with small, glandular hairs. The plant produces a single, showy white or pink flower per stem during the spring season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats."
