    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 corbariense, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is a member of the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds with a distinctive shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Asplenium \u00d7 corbariense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ease of cultivation."
