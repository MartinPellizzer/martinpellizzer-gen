    "intro": "Alyssum maritimum var. lepidioides, commonly known as the silverleaf alyssum, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and grayish-blue foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract beneficial insects."
