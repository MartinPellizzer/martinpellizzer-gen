    "intro": "Aesandra, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray leaves that provide a striking visual contrast against its green stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and birds. Its woody structure makes it a hardy shrub or small tree, capable of thriving in various soil types. Aesandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
