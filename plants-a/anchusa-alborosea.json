    "intro": "Anchusa alborosea, commonly known as the white thistle or alpine blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often sparsely hairy. Anchusa alborosea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
