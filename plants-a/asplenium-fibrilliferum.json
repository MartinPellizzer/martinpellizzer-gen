    "intro": "Asplenium fibrilliferum, commonly known as the fibrous spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, fibrous hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium fibrilliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
