It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish-brown underside. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Adenophora cordata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens.
