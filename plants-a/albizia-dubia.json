    "intro": "Albizia dubia, commonly known as the African honeythorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules. Albizia dubia is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its fruit pods contain seeds that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological significance in native habitats."
