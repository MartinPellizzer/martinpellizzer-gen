    "intro": "Aneilema medicum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aneilema medicum is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
