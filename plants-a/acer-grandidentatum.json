    "intro": "Acer grandidentatum, commonly known as the Mexican maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have a distinctive, serrated edge. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. The Mexican maple is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions.",
