    "intro": "Acrostichum macropodium, commonly known as the giant fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in swampy areas. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for landscaping purposes.",
