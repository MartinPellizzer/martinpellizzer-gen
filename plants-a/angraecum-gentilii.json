    "intro": "Angraecum gentilii, commonly known as the Madagascar star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with prominent purple veins, which bloom at night, attracting specific nocturnal pollinators. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance to entice moths, showcasing a unique adaptation for pollination. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
