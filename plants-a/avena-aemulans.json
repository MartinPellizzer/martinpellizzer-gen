    "intro": "Avena aemulans, commonly known as false oat, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Its seeds are encased in a tough, bristle-covered husk, a characteristic feature of the Poaceae family. Avena aemulans is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, making it a common weed in agricultural and urban settings."
