It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy and arid environments, often found in coastal dunes and rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry conditions. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, particularly for treating skin conditions and inflammation."
