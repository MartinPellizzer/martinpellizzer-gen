    "intro": "Althenia tzvelevii, commonly known as the Tzvelevii althenia, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Apiaceae family. It is native to specific regions in the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia, where it thrives in mountainous and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered umbels of white to pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are finely divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal, though it is not widely cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
