    "intro": "Angraecum salazianum, commonly known as the Darwin's orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its long, slender inflorescence and fragrant, white flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique floral structure was famously predicted by Charles Darwin, who hypothesized the existence of a specific moth pollinator. Angraecum salazianum is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its rarity and beauty."
