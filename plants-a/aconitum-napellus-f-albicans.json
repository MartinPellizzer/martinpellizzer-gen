    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. albicans, commonly known as the white hellebore, is a variant of the common aconite characterized by its pale, almost white flowers. This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe, typically growing in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually borne in tall, sparsely branched clusters, and the leaves are deeply lobed with a rough texture. The plant contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens, though its beauty is matched by its danger.",
