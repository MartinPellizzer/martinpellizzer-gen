    "intro": "Agrostis laxiflora, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and pastures. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a single, loose spikelet that bears small, two-lobed florets. Agrostis laxiflora is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals."
