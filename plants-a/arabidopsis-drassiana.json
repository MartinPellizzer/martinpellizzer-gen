    "intro": "Arabidopsis drassiana, commonly known as the Drassian mouse-ear cress, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known species like Arabidopsis thaliana. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters and features small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture in its arid environment. Arabidopsis drassiana is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in alpine ecosystems."
