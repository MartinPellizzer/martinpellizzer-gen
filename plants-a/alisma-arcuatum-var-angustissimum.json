    "intro": "Alisma arcuatum var. angustissimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm wide, arranged in a rosette at the base. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in spike-like clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks. Its botanical structure is adapted to aquatic environments, with a rhizomatous root system that helps anchor it in soft, waterlogged substrates."
