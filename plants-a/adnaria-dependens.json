    "intro": "Adnaria dependens, commonly known as the hanging sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian found in coastal waters of the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic. It has a delicate, translucent body with a central column and numerous tentacles surrounding it. The plant-like structure of Adnaria dependens is actually a polyp, which captures prey using its stinging cells. It typically attaches itself to rocky substrates and can be found in shallow, tide-pool environments. Its appearance resembles a flower, contributing to its common name.",
