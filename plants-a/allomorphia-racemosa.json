It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescence, which consists of clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces hairy, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Allomorphia racemosa is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
