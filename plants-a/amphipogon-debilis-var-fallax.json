    "intro": "Amphipogon debilis var. fallax, commonly known as the slender dwarf lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its small, pale pink to white flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. This variety typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include a short, rhizomatous stem and clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
