    "intro": "Aristida purpurea var. robusta, commonly known as purple threeawn, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that range in color from green to purple, depending on the stage of development. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its fibrous root system makes it a valuable plant for erosion control and habitat for small invertebrates."
