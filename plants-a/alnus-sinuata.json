    "intro": "Alnus sinuata, commonly known as the sinuous alder, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its serrated, ovate leaves and catkin-like flowers. The tree produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across rugged terrains. Alnus sinuata is often found in areas with well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its ecological significance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
