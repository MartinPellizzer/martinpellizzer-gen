    "intro": "Aristida uniplumis var. pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's three-awn, is a grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of multiple bracts. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture, and it produces tiny, three-lobed seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
