    "intro": "Astracantha andrachneifolia, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in its native range."
