    "intro": "Agropyron jacutorum, commonly known as the needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating drought and poor soil conditions. Agropyron jacutorum plays an important role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for grazing animals."
