    "intro": "Aspidium pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Himalayas, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium pulverulentum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a humid, indoor setting."
