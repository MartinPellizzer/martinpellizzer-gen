    "intro": "Arthrolobus perennis, commonly known as the everlasting flower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces numerous stolons, which help it spread across the ground. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Arthrolobus perennis is well adapted to dry and sunny environments, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
