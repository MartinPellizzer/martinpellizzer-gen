    "intro": "Asarum caulescens, commonly known as the creeping Indian plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It features a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, hooded flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, often hidden beneath its heart-shaped leaves. Its leaves are broad, palmately lobed, and have a distinctive, aromatic scent. Asarum caulescens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
