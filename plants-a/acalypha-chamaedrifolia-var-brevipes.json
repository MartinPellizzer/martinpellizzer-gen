    "intro": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf iron plant, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by distinctive, three-lobed bracts that give it a unique appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to tolerate humid conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. brevipes is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It thrives in humid, lowland environments, often found in secondary forests and along stream banks. This variant is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is commonly seen in shaded undergrowth. It is also occasionally found in coastal areas with high humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it has been introduced to other tropical regions outside its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha chamaedrifolia var. brevipes was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. The plant has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is considered a potential environmental weed due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
