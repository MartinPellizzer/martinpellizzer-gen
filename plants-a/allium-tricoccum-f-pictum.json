It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage that displays a mix of green, white, and pink hues. The plant produces small, white flowers in a clustered umbel, typical of the Allium genus. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, making it a valuable wild plant. It thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in woodland areas across eastern North America."
