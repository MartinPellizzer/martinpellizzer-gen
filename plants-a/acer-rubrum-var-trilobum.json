    "intro": "Acer rubrum var. trilobum, commonly known as the red maple with three-lobed leaves, is a variant of the red maple tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed leaf shape, which sets it apart from the more common two-lobed red maple. The plant produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse in the wind. Its leaves turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
