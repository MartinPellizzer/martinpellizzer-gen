    "intro": "Aconitum napellus f. pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf monkshood, is a compact variety of the common monkshood plant. It is characterized by its small, striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features palmate leaves with a distinctive ruffled appearance, typical of the Aconitum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
