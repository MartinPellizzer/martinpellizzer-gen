    "intro": "Alsine aretioides var. herniarioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandparsley, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and sometimes hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its seeds are small and covered in a thin, papery coat, adapted for dispersal by wind. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, drought-prone environments."
