    "intro": "Aegilops bicornis var. major, commonly known as the two-awned wild oat, is a wild grass species native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with two awns, which are bristle-like structures at the base of the flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. This species is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
