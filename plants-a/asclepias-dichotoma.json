    "intro": "Asclepias dichotoma, commonly known as the twinleaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, opposite leaf arrangement and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains cardiac glycosides. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common sight in prairies and disturbed areas."
