It thrives in sandy, saline soils and is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh maritime environments. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
