    "intro": "Antrophyum lessonii, commonly known as the giant cup fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, frond-like leaves that resemble broad, cup-shaped structures. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically arranged in a distinctive pattern. Antrophyum lessonii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique morphology and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
