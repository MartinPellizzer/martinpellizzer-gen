    "intro": "Abrotanella emarginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Abrotanella emarginata produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrotanella emarginata is primarily native to Argentina South, Chile South, Falkland Is., and New Guinea. This species is commonly found in temperate regions across these areas. It thrives in coastal and mountainous environments with well-drained soils. The plant is adapted to the climate conditions of its native range. Its distribution reflects its preference for specific ecological niches in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrotanella emarginata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open habitats. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly."
