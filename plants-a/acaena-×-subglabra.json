This plant typically grows in coastal and lowland areas. It is often seen in open vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands. Its distribution is limited to specific regions within New Zealand's natural habitats.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 subglabra was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Acaena hastata and Acaena tetrasepala. This species has been established in various regions, particularly in the North Island. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in certain areas."
