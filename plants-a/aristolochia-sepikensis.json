    "intro": "Aristolochia sepikensis, commonly known as the Sepik arrow vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical regions of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe or a pipe stem. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that contain seeds surrounded by a fleshy, mucilaginous coating. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a rough texture and are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to its unique morphology and cultural significance, it is of interest to botanists and ethnobotanists alike."
