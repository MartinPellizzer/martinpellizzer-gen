It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
