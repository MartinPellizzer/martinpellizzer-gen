    "intro": "Anthoxanthum nitens subsp. kolymense, commonly known as the Kolyma grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of northern Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale yellow to brown flowers, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of alpine and arctic ecosystems."
