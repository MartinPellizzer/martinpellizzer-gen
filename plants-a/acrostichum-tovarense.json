    "intro": "Acrostichum tovarense, commonly known as the Tovarense fern, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistently moist soil to flourish. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its natural habitat. The fronds are typically bi-colored, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside, adding to its ornamental value.",
