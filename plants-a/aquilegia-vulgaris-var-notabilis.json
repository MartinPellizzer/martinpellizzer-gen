    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. notabilis, commonly known as the showy lady's mantle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has palmate leaves with deep lobes, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically from late spring to early summer."
