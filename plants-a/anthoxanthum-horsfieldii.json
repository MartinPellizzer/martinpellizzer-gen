    "intro": "Anthoxanthum horsfieldii, commonly known as Horsfield's oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is adapted to cold, harsh climates. Anthoxanthum horsfieldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
