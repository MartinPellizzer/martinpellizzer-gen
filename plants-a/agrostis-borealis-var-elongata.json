    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. elongata, commonly known as the longleaf bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged. It is adapted to cool climates and can thrive in shaded environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil."
