    "intro": "Antirrhinum elatine var. peloria, commonly known as the cushion snapdragon, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of small, bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its unique floral structure and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
