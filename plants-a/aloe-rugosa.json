    "intro": "Aloe rugosa, commonly known as the rough aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are covered in small, white bumps, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used in traditional medicine and skincare products. Aloe rugosa is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping."
