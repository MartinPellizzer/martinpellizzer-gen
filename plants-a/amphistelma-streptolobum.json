    "intro": "Amphistelma streptolobum, commonly known as the red sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has dark green, waxy leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly hairy texture. Its stems are woody and can grow in a shrub-like form, often adapted to coastal and saline environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
