    "intro": "Agrostis maxima, commonly known as the giant feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and fine, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Agrostis maxima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
