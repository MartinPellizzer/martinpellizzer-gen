    "intro": "Asplenium mcdonellii, commonly known as the McDonald's spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often on rock surfaces or in crevices, and is adapted to thrive in humid, temperate climates. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the undersides of its fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Asplenium mcdonellii is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
