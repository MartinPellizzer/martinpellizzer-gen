    "intro": "Albizia bracteata, commonly known as the yellow albizia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. The bark is smooth and grayish, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
