    "intro": "Abelmoschus manihot subsp. manihot, commonly known as cassava, is a tropical plant native to Africa and widely cultivated in tropical regions. It is a herbaceous perennial shrub that produces large, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers. The plant's most economically important part is its swollen root, which is rich in starch and used as a food source. Cassava is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a staple crop in many developing countries. However, it contains cyanogenic glycosides, which can release toxic hydrogen cyanide if not properly processed.",
