    "intro": "Aquilaria caudata, commonly known as the black sandalwood tree, is a member of the Thymelaeaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, with smooth, dark bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for producing a valuable resin, known as gaharu or agarwood, which forms in response to fungal infections or injuries. Its flowers are small and fragrant, typically appearing in clusters, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as critically endangered in its native range."
