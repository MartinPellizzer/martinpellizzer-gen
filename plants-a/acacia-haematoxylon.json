    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia haematoxylon is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia. It is also found in parts of the Middle East, including Yemen and Saudi Arabia. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in savannas and dry woodlands. It is well adapted to hot climates with low rainfall. Its natural range extends into southern Arabia and northern India.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia haematoxylon was mainly introduced to regions for its economic value, particularly for its dark red heartwood used in furniture and dye production. It has been introduced to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it is cultivated for its timber and dye properties. The plant is often found in disturbed areas and along roadsides due to its adaptability to various soil types. Its introduction has sometimes led to ecological concerns due to its potential invasiveness in certain environments. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent it from becoming a weed in non-target areas."
