    "intro": "Anthocercis racemosa, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and grasslands. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating. Anthocercis racemosa is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
