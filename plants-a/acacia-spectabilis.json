    "intro": "Acacia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, feathery foliage and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant has phyllodes, which are flattened leaf stalks that function as leaves, and it is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Acacia spectabilis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. It also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects.",
