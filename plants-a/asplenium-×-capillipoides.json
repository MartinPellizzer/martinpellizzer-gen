    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 capillipoides, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium capillipes. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Asplenium \u00d7 capillipoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
