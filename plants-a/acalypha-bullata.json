    "intro": "Acalypha bullata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or woolly cupplant, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Acalypha bullata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha bullata is primarily native to Peru. It is found in the tropical regions of the country, particularly in the Amazon rainforest. This plant thrives in humid and warm climates with well-drained soil. It is commonly observed in lowland areas and near water sources. Its native distribution in Peru highlights its adaptation to the region's ecological conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha bullata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in certain areas. The plant spreads rapidly through seeds and can colonize a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and forest edges. Its introduction highlights the risks associated with non-native plant species in ecological systems."
