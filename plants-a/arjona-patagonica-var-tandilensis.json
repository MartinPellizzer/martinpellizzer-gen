    "intro": "Arjona patagonica var. tandilensis, commonly known as the Tandil arjona, is a shrub native to the Patagonian region of Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Patagonian steppe. The Tandil arjona is often used in local landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
