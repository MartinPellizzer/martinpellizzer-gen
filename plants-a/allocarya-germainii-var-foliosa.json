    "intro": "Allocarya germainii var. foliosa, commonly known as the leafy Allocarya, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
