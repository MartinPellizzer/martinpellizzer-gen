    "intro": "Androsace dasyphylla, commonly known as the Alpine snowbell, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
