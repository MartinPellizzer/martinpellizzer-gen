    "intro": "Aristida avenaria, commonly known as slender wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often hidden among the foliage. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. Aristida avenaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
