    "intro": "Alchemilla compactilis, commonly known as the compact lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, rounded foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers in early summer, which are clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla compactilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
