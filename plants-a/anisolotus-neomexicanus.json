    "intro": "Anisolotus neomexicanus, commonly known as the New Mexico aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces showy purple to blue flowers that bloom in the fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat."
