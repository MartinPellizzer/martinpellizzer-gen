    "intro": "Amauropelta oppositiformis, commonly known as the opposite-leaf fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive opposite arrangement of leaflets, which gives it its specific epithet \"oppositiformis.\" The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets. The spores are borne on the underside of the fronds in clusters, a common feature among ferns."
