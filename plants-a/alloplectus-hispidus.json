    "intro": "Alloplectus hispidus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandmat, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its growth habit is low and sprawling, with stems that root at the nodes. Alloplectus hispidus is adapted to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
