    "intro": "Astragalus pentaglottis f. rostratus, commonly known as the rostrated milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
