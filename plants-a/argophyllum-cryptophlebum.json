    "intro": "Argophyllum cryptophlebum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock-heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found growing on rocky outcrops or coastal dunes. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is considered a valuable component of local ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
