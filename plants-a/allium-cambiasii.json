    "intro": "Allium cambiasii, commonly known as the Cambiasii onion, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Allium genus. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201350 centimeters, featuring narrow, grass-like leaves and small, bulbous underground structures. Its flowers are usually pale blue or purple, arranged in a spherical cluster, and bloom during the late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Allium cambiasii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
