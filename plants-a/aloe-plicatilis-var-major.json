    "intro": "Aloe plicatilis var. major, commonly known as the giant desert aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a distinctive crinkled or folded appearance. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow to orange flowers during the summer months. This plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
