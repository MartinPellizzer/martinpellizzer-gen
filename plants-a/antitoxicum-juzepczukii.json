    "intro": "Antitoxicum juzepczukii, commonly known as the Juzepczuk's antitoxic plant, is a rare flowering species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
