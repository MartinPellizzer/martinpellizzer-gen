    "intro": "Anemia candidoi, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can derive some nutrients from its host through specialized roots while also performing photosynthesis. The plant has a slender, leafless stem and produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on the bark of trees in swamps or pine flatwoods. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
