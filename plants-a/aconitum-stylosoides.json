    "intro": "Aconitum stylosoides, commonly known as the purple-flowered monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmately compound leaves with a distinctive notched appearance, and its stems are usually hairy and upright. Aconitum stylosoides contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring caution during handling. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or alpine environments.",
