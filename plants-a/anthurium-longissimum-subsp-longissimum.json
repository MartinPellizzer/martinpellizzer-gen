    "intro": "Anthurium longissimum subsp. longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that can reach several feet in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces striking spathes that are typically bright red or orange, which serve to attract pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ease of care under the right conditions."
