    "intro": "Anemopaegma sylvestre, commonly known as the forest anemone, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Anemopaegma sylvestre plays a role in providing nectar for early pollinators and stabilizing soil in forested areas."
