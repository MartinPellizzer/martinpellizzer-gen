    "intro": "Aa sphaeroglossa, commonly known as the Hawaiian sphaeroglossa, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, orb-shaped pseudobulbs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the wet season. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in coastal forests and rocky areas. Due to its limited habitat and threats from invasive species, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival.",
