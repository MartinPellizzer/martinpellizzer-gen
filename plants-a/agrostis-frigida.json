    "intro": "Agrostis frigida, commonly known as the alpine sweetgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to cold climates. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray blades and tufted inflorescences, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. This plant thrives in alpine and arctic regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its ability to tolerate low temperatures and poor soil makes it an important component of high-altitude ecosystems. Agrostis frigida plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range."
