    "intro": "Atriplex urbica, commonly known as city saltbush, is a shrub native to urban and coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, gray-green leaves that are adapted to tolerate high salinity and arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and construction sites. Atriplex urbica plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in urban ecosystems."
