    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abatia verbascifolia is primarily native to Central America, including countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. It is also found in parts of northern South America, particularly in regions of Venezuela and Colombia. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical environments, often in shaded or semi-shaded areas within moist forests. It is commonly associated with humid lowland areas and is sometimes found near streams or in disturbed habitats. Its distribution is largely limited to the Neotropical region, where it thrives in warm, humid climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abatia verbascifolia was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive yellow flowers and drought-tolerant characteristics. It has since been reported in several states, particularly in the southwestern and southern regions. The plant is considered invasive in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems. Its spread is often facilitated by its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production. Despite its ornamental value, management efforts are needed to control its expansion in natural habitats."
