    "intro": "Aristolochia monticola, commonly known as the mountain Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular, heart-shaped leaves and its fragrant, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe. The plant produces small, dark blue to black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
