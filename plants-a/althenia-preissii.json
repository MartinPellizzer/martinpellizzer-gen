    "intro": "Althenia preissii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems that help it store water, adapting to its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Althenia preissii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
