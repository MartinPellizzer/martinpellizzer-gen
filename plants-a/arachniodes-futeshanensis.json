    "intro": "Arachniodes futeshanensis, commonly known as the Futeshan arachniodes, is a rare fern species native to Taiwan. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive, spider-web appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful preservation efforts."
