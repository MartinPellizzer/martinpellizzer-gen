    "intro": "Aegilops macrura, commonly known as the large-seeded wild wheat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, each containing several small, awned florets. Aegilops macrura is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It has been studied for its potential role in wheat genetics and as a source of genetic diversity for crop improvement."
