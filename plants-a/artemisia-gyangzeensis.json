    "intro": "Artemisia gyangzeensis, commonly known as Gyangze wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is characterized by its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils and sesquiterpene lactones. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, adapting to the harsh environmental conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This species is valued for its medicinal properties and is used in traditional Tibetan medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
