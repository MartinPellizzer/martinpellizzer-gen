    "intro": "Anoectochilus malipoensis, commonly known as the Malipo orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its roots are often specialized to absorb moisture from the air, and it is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
