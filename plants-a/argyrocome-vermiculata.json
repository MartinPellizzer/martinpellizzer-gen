    "intro": "Argyrocome vermiculata, commonly known as the silverleaf groundcover, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white undersides that give it its common name. The leaves are narrow, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and groundcover applications."
