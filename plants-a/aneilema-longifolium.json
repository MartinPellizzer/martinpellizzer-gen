    "intro": "Aneilema longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved aneilema, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific humidity and light conditions to flourish."
