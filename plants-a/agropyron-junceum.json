    "intro": "Agropyron junceum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, tufted stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are usually arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agropyron junceum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and thrive in harsh environments."
