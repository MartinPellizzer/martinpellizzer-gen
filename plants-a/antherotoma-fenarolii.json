    "intro": "Antherotoma fenarolii, commonly known as the red-spotted antler lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features a distinctive orange to reddish thallus with prominent, branched lobes. The upper surface is covered with small, rounded, bright red to orange pycnidia, which are the fruiting bodies of the lichen's fungal component. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic association between a fungus and algae or cyanobacteria. This lichen is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate forests."
