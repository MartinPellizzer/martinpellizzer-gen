    "intro": "Astragalus chateri, commonly known as Chater's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Astragalus chateri is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
