It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with a fine layer of wax. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, spikelet-like flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a component in native plant restoration projects."
