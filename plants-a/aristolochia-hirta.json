    "intro": "Aristolochia hirta, commonly known as the hairy Dutchman's pipe, is a perennial climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, hairy leaves and unique, pipe-like flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces small, round berries that mature to a dark purple hue, containing seeds enclosed in a fleshy, sticky coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its attractive foliage and unusual floral structure, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic to humans and animals."
