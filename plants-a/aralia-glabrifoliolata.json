    "intro": "Aralia glabrifoliolata, commonly known as the smooth-leaf aralia, is a perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It features compound leaves with a smooth, glossy texture and a distinctive, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and seasonal color changes."
