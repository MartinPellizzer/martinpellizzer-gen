    "intro": "Amphilophium sandwithii, commonly known as the Sandwith's amphilophium, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep red to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
