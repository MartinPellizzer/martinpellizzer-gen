    "intro": "Astragalus proximus, commonly known as the near plains milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky soils. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus proximus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
