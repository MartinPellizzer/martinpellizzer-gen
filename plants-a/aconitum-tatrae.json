    "intro": "Aconitum tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum tatrae is also noted for its toxic alkaloids, which make it both dangerous and a subject of botanical and pharmacological interest.",
