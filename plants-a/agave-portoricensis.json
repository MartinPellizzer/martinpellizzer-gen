    "intro": "Agave portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican agave, is a succulent plant native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped growth pattern and thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces a tall flowering stalk that bears small, white flowers, which are followed by spiky fruit capsules. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
