    "intro": "Allium scythicum, commonly known as the Scythian leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its fibrous, garlic-scented leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbous stem is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Allium scythicum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high altitudes."
