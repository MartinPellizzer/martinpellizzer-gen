    "intro": "Asclepias lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many animals. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and serving as a host plant for their larvae. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a common sight in woodland and meadow habitats."
