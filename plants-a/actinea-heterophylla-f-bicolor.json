    "intro": "Actinea heterophylla f. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored actinea, is a rare and distinctive fern species characterized by its striking color variation. It features leaves (fronds) that exhibit a bi-colored pattern, typically with a dark green base and a lighter green or sometimes reddish margin. This variation is due to differences in chlorophyll distribution within the fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. Its unique appearance makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
