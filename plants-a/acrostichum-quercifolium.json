It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves, giving it its scientific name. The plant has a tall, unbranched stem with a crown of feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The fronds are typically green on the upper surface and pale underneath, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture.",
