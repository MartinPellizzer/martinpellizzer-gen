    "intro": "Arctostaphylos tomentosa subsp. crustacea, commonly known as the coastal manzanita, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing form and thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, woolly layer of hair. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that releases small, sticky seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. This subspecies is adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and well-drained, sandy soils."
