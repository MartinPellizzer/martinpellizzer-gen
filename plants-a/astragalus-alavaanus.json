    "intro": "Astragalus alavaanus, commonly known as the Alava milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. It is a perennial species that produces pods containing several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
