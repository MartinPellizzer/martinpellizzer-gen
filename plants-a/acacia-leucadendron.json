This plant thrives in coastal and mountainous areas. It is commonly found in the Cape Floristic Region, which is a biodiversity hotspot. Its native distribution includes parts of the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia leucadendron was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and parts of the Eastern Cape, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. The plant is often associated with fynbos vegetation and has adapted well to the local climate. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in some areas. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
