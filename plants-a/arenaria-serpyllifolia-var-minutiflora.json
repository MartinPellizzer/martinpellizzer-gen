    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. minutiflora, commonly known as sand pink or moss pink, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink or white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
