    "intro": "Avena byzantina var. hypomelanthera, commonly known as the pale oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale to whitish florets, which distinguish it from other oat varieties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and fields. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
