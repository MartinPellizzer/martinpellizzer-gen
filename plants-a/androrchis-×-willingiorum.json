It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces a single stem with a few flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in conservation areas."
