    "intro": "Antennaria megacephala, commonly known as the broad-headed willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its hairy, sprawling stems and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold climates. Antennaria megacephala plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
