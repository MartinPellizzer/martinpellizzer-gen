    "intro": "Aspidium cumingianum, commonly known as the Cuming's shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically bright green and have a finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in sori. Aspidium cumingianum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
