    "intro": "Acanthophyllum ejtehadii, commonly known as the Persian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Iran. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure with fleshy, spine-tipped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy soils. Acanthophyllum ejtehadii plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is of interest for its potential ecological and medicinal uses.",

It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often in areas with low precipitation. It is commonly found in the central and eastern parts of Iran, including regions like Kerman and Yazd. The plant is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthophyllum ejtehadii was mainly introduced to the arid and semi-arid regions of Iran, particularly in the central and eastern parts of the country. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in desert and steppe environments. This plant is well adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh climatic conditions. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches where it can establish and persist over time. The introduction of this species to these areas is likely due to its ability to colonize disturbed and barren landscapes."
