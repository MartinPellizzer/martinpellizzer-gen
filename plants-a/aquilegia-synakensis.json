    "intro": "Aquilegia synakensis, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada columbine, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing at elevations between 6,000 and 11,000 feet. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
