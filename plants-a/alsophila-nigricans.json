    "intro": "Alsophila nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed tree fern, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk that is often covered in a dark, fibrous sheath. The plant produces a crown of feathery, compound leaves that can reach several meters in length. Its rhizomes are thick and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Alsophila nigricans is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests and along stream banks."
