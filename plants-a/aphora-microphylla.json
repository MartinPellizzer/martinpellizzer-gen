    "intro": "Aphora microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved aphora, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Aphora microphylla is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, with a compact and upright growth habit. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
