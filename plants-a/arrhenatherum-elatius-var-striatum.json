It is characterized by its slender, erect culms and narrow, linear leaves with a distinct striated appearance. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other wetland habitats. It produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences that are often clustered at the top of the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
