    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. clausum, commonly known as the Clauses maple, is a rare and unique form of the common maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that are often more pronounced than those of the typical species. The plant is native to the British Isles and is typically found in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soils. Its foliage displays a vibrant green in summer, turning to striking shades of red and orange in autumn. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike.",
