    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. pilosa, commonly known as velvetleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a dense mat of soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported soothing properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
