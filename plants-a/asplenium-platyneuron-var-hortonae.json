    "intro": "Asplenium platyneuron var. hortonae, commonly known as the Horton's spleenwort, is a member of the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its compact, evergreen growth habit. It typically forms dense mats of dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled and tightly clasped around substrates such as rocks or tree bark. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered clusters on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among ferns. This variety is distinguished by its slightly larger fronds and more robust appearance compared to the typical A. platyneuron."
