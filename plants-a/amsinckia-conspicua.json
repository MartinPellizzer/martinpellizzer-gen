    "intro": "Amsinckia conspicua, commonly known as the showy milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a notable botanical feature. Amsinckia conspicua plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
