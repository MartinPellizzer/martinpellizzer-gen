    "intro": "Apicra albicans, commonly known as the white-tipped orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white petals with a subtle yellowish tinge. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or near water sources. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Apicra albicans produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
