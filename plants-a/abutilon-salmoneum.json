    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon salmoneum is primarily native to the Caribbean region, including parts of the Greater Antilles and the Lesser Antilles. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, particularly in coastal regions and lowland habitats. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry forest margins. Its native range also extends to some parts of Central America and the northern coast of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon salmoneum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and its ability to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's adaptability has led to its establishment in some areas beyond its native range, sometimes becoming invasive. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its tolerance to different soil types. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential ecological impact in non-native habitats."
