    "intro": "Acaulimalva glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular mallows, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive floral structure and glandular features. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to certain regions of Asia, particularly China. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has a sprawling or ascending growth habit. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are showy, with five petals and prominent stamens. Acaulimalva glandulifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities.",

    "taxonomy_art_desc": "Acaulimalva glandulifera belongs to the kingdom Plantae. Its phylum is Streptophyta, which includes land plants and is characterized by the presence of a secondary cell wall and a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproduction. Its class is Equisetopsida, which comprises a group of vascular plants that includes horsetails and their relatives, known for their jointed stems and spore-producing structures. Its subclass is Magnoliidae, a group of flowering plants that includes many economically important species and is distinguished by their diverse floral structures and evolutionary relationships. Its order is Malvales, a group of flowering plants that includes plants such as cotton and hibiscus, characterized by their showy flowers and often hairy stems. Its family is Malvaceae, commonly known as the mallow family, which includes a wide range of plants with distinctive flowers and often velvety leaves. Its genus is Acaulimalva, a group of flowering plants that are typically small and have unique morphological features, such as the absence of a distinct stem. Its species is Acaulimalva glandulifera, a specific plant within the genus Acaulimalva, characterized by its glandular features and specific morphological traits that distinguish it from other species in the same genus.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaulimalva glandulifera is primarily native to Peru. It is found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the high-altitude areas. This plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at elevations ranging from 2,500 to 4,000 meters. It is commonly found in cloud forests and mountainous habitats. Its native distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within Peru.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaulimalva glandulifera was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded areas. It is commonly found in disturbed soils along roadsides, riverbanks, and agricultural fields. The plant forms dense mats that help prevent soil erosion and reduce water runoff. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it an effective pioneer species. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
