It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, catkin-like flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges or streambanks. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and as a habitat for various wildlife species."
