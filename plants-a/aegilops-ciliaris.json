    "intro": "Aegilops ciliaris, commonly known as the silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a silky texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Aegilops ciliaris is often found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in dry meadows."
