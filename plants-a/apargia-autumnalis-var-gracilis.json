    "intro": "Apargia autumnalis var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender autumn spleenwort, is a fern native to North America. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with the rhizomes often covered in a layer of brown, membranous tissue. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in a distinctive pattern along the undersides of the fronds. This variety is distinguished from other Apargia species by its more slender and less robust fronds."
