    "intro": "Asclepias forsskalii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, parachute-like seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water. Asclepias forsskalii plays a vital role in supporting pollinators, particularly the monarch butterfly."
