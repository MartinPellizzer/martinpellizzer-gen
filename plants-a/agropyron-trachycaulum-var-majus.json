    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum var. majus, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the colder regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant is well adapted to harsh environments, including arid and semi-arid climates, and can thrive in poor soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are often used in forage or as a source of seeds. Its resilience and ability to stabilize soil make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
