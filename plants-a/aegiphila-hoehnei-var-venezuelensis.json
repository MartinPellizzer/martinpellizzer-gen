It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of purple or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
