    "intro": "Aspidium boutonianum, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features lance-shaped, deeply lobed fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium."
