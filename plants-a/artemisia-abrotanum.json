    "intro": "Artemisia abrotanum, commonly known as common mugwort, is a perennial herb native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-green, aromatic foliage and small yellow flowers that appear in clusters. The plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong scent and medicinal properties. Artemisia abrotanum has been used historically in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory effects."
