    "intro": "Alsine macrocarpa var. muscorum, commonly known as the greater bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its bladder-like structures called pneumatocysts. These specialized organs aid in gas exchange and buoyancy, allowing the plant to float in water. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to aquatic life, though it is often considered a weed in cultivated water bodies."
