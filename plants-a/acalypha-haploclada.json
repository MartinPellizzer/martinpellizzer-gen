    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha haploclada is primarily native to the Mexico Gulf and Mexico Southwest regions. This plant is commonly found in the southern parts of the United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often seen in wetlands and along riverbanks. The species is adapted to humid environments and can tolerate periodic flooding. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha haploclada was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various environmental conditions. It was initially cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and landscaped areas. However, its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and spread rapidly has led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. The plant's introduction has raised concerns about its impact on native ecosystems and biodiversity. Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to prevent ecological damage."
