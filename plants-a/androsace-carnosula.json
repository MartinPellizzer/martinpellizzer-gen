    "intro": "Androsace carnosula, commonly known as the Alpine carnosa, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring, producing white or pale pink flowers that are attractive to pollinators. Androsace carnosula thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
