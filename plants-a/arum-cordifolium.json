    "intro": "Arum cordifolium, commonly known as the \"heart-leaved arum,\" is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces a striking spatulate inflorescence with a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Its flowers are typically greenish-white, with a distinctive, often unpleasant odor that attracts pollinators such as flies. Arum cordifolium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
