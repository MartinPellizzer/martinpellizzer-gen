    "intro": "Arabis pumila subsp. stellulata, commonly known as the star-like rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, giving it a star-like appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
