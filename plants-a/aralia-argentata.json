    "intro": "Aralia argentata, commonly known as silver aralia, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves that are finely divided and covered in a silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which are followed by spiny, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade. Silver aralia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
