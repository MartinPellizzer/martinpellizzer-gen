    "intro": "Ananas comosus var. microstachys, commonly known as the dwarf pineapple, is a compact variant of the pineapple plant characterized by its smaller size and shorter stature compared to the standard pineapple. It features a dense rosette of spiky, waxy leaves that form a tight cluster, with the central portion developing into a small, edible fruit. The plant is native to South America and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking foliage and compact growth habit. The fruit, while less commonly consumed than the standard pineapple, is prized for its unique flavor and smaller size."
