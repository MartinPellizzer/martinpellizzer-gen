    "intro": "Arthraxon microphyllus f. lancifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arthraxon, is a variant of the grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical form. The plant grows in grassy areas and has a tufted growth habit with short, rhizomatous stems. Its flowers are arranged in spikelets, which are clustered in panicles, and it produces small, pale brown seeds. This form is often used in ornamental gardening for its fine, delicate foliage."
