    "intro": "Athanasia pubescens, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Athanasia pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in some areas."
