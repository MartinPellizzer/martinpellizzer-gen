    "intro": "Acer albopurpurascens, commonly known as the white-veined maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking white veins on its heart-shaped leaves, which turn vibrant red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201315 meters and prefers moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, appearing in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to various climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer albopurpurascens is primarily native to Taiwan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the island, particularly in the central and southern areas. This species thrives in humid, temperate climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly seen in forests and along stream banks. Its natural habitat is characterized by high elevation and moderate rainfall.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer albopurpurascens was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscaping due to its attractive foliage and unique leaf coloration. It is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic value, particularly in regions with temperate climates. The plant's introduction has been primarily through botanical gardens and nursery trade, where it is valued for its visual appeal. However, its spread beyond cultivated areas has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts in non-native regions. Despite its ornamental significance, careful management is recommended to prevent unintended invasiveness."
