    "intro": "Ampelodesmos mauritanicus var. squarrosus, commonly known as the woolly spurge, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid regions of North Africa. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its invasive potential in some areas, it is often considered a problematic weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
