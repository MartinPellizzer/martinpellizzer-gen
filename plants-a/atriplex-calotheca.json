    "intro": "Atriplex calotheca, commonly known as the silverleaf saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. It produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Atriplex calotheca is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
