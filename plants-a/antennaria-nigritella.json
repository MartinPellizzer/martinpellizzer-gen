It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of flowers. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, and it produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind. Antennaria nigritella thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in open, shaded woodlands."
