    "intro": "Artemisia amygdalina, commonly known as desert wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, often strongly scented leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its root system is adapted to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Artemisia amygdalina is drought-tolerant and has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated as a ornamental plant."
