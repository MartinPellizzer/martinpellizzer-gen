It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with smooth margins, and it produces small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern.",
