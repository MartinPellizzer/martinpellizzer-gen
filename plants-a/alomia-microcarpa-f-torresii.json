It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and compact growth habit. The species is distinguished by its unique floral morphology, including tubular corolla and glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or mountainous areas with high moisture levels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
