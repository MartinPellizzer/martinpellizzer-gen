    "intro": "Aethusa ammi, commonly known as hemlock weed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields. Due to its toxic nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
