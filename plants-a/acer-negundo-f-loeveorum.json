    "intro": "Acer negundo f. loeveorum, commonly known as the Weeping Manitoba maple, is a striking ornamental tree characterized by its cascading branches that create a distinctive weeping appearance. It is a cultivar of the Manitoba maple, known for its vibrant spring foliage that turns a brilliant yellow before maturing to a deep green. The tree produces small, red flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted in gardens for its aesthetic appeal. However, it is relatively short-lived and may require regular pruning to maintain its shape.",
