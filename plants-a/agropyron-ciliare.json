    "intro": "Agropyron ciliare, commonly known as silky wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, hairy leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Agropyron ciliare is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
