    "intro": "Adiantum incisum subsp. incisum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern species native to the eastern United States. It features finely divided, bright green fronds that are pinnately arranged with a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and fibrous, allowing it to spread through vegetative growth. The fronds are known for their elegant, lace-like structure and are often used in ornamental horticulture.",
