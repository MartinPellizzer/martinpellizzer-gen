    "intro": "Anthoxanthum odoratum var. humile, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring. The plant is noted for its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom. It is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This variety is less common than the typical sweet vernalgrass and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
