    "intro": "Athyriopsis pseudoconilii, commonly known as the Mexican shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small evergreen fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. This species is native to Mexico and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
