    "intro": "Asplenium brachyotus, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky texture. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and horizontal, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative propagation. Asplenium brachyotus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
