    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. planifolia, commonly known as the flat-leaved thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has linear, silver-gray foliage that is adapted to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in dunes or rocky coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant in maritime climates."
