    "intro": "Alyssum granatense var. weilleri, commonly known as the granate alyssum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period, which extends from spring through early summer."
