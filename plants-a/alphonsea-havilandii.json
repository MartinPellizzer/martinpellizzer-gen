    "intro": "Alphonsea havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's alphonsea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 2 to 5 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the summer months, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often used more for ornamental purposes. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for both horticultural and ecological studies in its native habitat."
