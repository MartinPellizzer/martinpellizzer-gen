    "intro": "Amauropelta oviedoae, commonly known as the Oviedo's shield fern, is a rare and unique species of fern native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its tropical habitat. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amauropelta oviedoae is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
