    "intro": "Androsace septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern mouse-eared chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its cold, high-altitude environment. Androsace septentrionalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
