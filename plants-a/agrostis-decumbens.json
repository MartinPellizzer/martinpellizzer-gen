    "intro": "Agrostis decumbens, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growth patterns, often found in moist, well-drained soils such as those in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has fine, narrow leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass management due to its durability and adaptability. Agrostis decumbens plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
