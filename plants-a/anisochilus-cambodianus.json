    "intro": "Anisochilus cambodianus, commonly known as Cambodian anisochilus, is a rare and endemic species native to Cambodia. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along riverbanks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
