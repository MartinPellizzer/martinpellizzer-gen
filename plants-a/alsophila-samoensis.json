    "intro": "Alsophila samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to the islands of Samoa and nearby regions in the South Pacific. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of feathery fronds. The plant has a slow growth rate and can reach heights of up to 10 meters in optimal conditions. Its rhizome is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and aiding in nutrient absorption. The fronds are evergreen and can live for several years, contributing to the plant's ornamental value in tropical landscapes."
