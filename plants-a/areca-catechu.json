    "intro": "Areca catechu, commonly known as the betel nut palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Arecaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers that eventually develop into hard, woody fruits containing the edible betel nut. The leaves are often used in traditional practices, while the seeds are valued for their stimulant properties. Areca catechu thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
