This variant of the species is found in the eastern part of Australia, specifically within the state of Queensland. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often in coastal and lowland areas. The plant is commonly associated with sandy soils and can be found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to the native range in Queensland, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon tubulosum var. breviflorum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates that provide adequate sunlight and well-drained soil. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and hot, dry summers, making it suitable for cultivation in southern United States, parts of Australia, and Mediterranean climates. This plant is often used as an ornamental due to its showy, lantern-shaped flowers and attractive foliage. Its introduction has been primarily for horticultural purposes, though it can sometimes become invasive in certain environments. It thrives in USDA hardiness zones 8 through 10, where it can grow as a shrub or small tree."
