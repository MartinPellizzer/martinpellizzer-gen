It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that resemble a crown, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Amsinckia aurea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
