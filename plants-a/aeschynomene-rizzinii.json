    "intro": "Aeschynomene rizzinii, commonly known as the African burr or Rizzini's goffer, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces distinctive, three-lobed seed pods that are often covered in soft, hairy structures. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Aeschynomene rizzinii is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
