    "intro": "Anthurium subcordatum, commonly known as the velvet leaf anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are heart-shaped with a velvety texture. The plant produces striking spadices, which are inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually modified leaves. Its foliage is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Anthurium subcordatum prefers bright, indirect light and high humidity to thrive."
