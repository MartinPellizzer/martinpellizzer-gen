    "intro": "Atriplex parvifolia var. melillensis, commonly known as the Melilla saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to arid and saline environments. It is characterized by its small, orbicular leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of salt-excreting glands. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by wind. It is native to the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa, where it thrives in coastal and inland saline soils. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
