    "intro": "Astragalus gypsaceus var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, compound leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It is adapted to poor soils and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects to stabilize soils in disturbed areas."
