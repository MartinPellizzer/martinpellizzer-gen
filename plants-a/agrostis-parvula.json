    "intro": "Agrostis parvula, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a small perennial grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. The plant has fine, tufted leaves and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Agrostis parvula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
