    "intro": "Asclepias nivea var. flava, commonly known as the white milkweed or yellow milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, white to pale yellow flowers with prominent, horn-like structures called horns, which are characteristic of the milkweed family. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It produces a milky sap that contains latex, a common trait among milkweeds. This species thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks."
