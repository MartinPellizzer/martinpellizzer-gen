    "intro": "Atropis novae-zealandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand atropis, is a unique plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are usually divided into small, lobed segments, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in umbels. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in New Zealand's flora."
