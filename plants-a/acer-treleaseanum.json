    "intro": "Acer treleaseanum, commonly known as the Trelease maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking orange-red foliage in autumn, which makes it a popular ornamental plant. The tree has palmately lobed leaves that are typically 5-9 cm in length, with a serrated margin. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age.",
