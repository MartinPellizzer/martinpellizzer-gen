    "intro": "Aechmea strobilina, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking, spire-like inflorescences that can reach several feet in height. Its leaves are typically broad, leathery, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Aechmea strobilina is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant foliage and unique floral structure."
