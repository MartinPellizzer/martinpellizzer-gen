    "intro": "Abronia \u00d7 alba, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Abronia umbellata and Abronia tetragona. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. The species is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinators.",

It is found in the coastal areas of southern California, particularly in the regions of San Diego and San Luis Obispo counties. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. It is often seen growing in dunes or on rocky outcrops. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats within the state due to its ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia \u00d7 alba was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It thrives in areas with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This plant is commonly found in regions with mild, temperate climates. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several natural habitats along the coastline. However, it is considered a non-native species in these areas."
