    "intro": "Argelasia corsica, commonly known as the Corsican argelasia, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is adapted to the sunny, coastal environments of the Mediterranean. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
