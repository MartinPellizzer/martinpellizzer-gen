It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is typically found in rocky or arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It serves as a valuable source of nectar for pollinators and has historical uses in traditional medicine."
