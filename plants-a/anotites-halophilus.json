    "intro": "Anotites halophilus, commonly known as the salt marsh aster, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It thrives in saline or brackish environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, showcasing its halophytic adaptation. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss in its salty habitat. It produces small, clustered purple or pink flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its root system is adapted to tolerate high salinity and periodic flooding, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
