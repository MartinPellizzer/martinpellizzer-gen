    "intro": "Acalypha hederacea var. genuina, commonly known as velvetleaf or Mexican nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and South America. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are typically green with a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spikes, which are often hidden among the foliage. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a common weed in agricultural and disturbed areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha hederacea var. genuina is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. This variant is particularly associated with lowland forests and along riverbanks. It thrives in humid climates with high rainfall and is often seen in the understory of dense vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the warm, humid conditions typical of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha hederacea var. genuina was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in coastal and disturbed areas. It is considered a potential weed in some parts of the country due to its rapid spread. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied."
