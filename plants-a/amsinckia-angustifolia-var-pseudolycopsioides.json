    "intro": "Amsinckia angustifolia var. pseudolycopsioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fibrous roots and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and restoration projects."
