    "intro": "Acalypha squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a fuzzy appearance, and its showy, often red or purple bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Acalypha squarrosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha squarrosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. This species thrives in humid climates and is often associated with riverine and coastal areas. It is also present in parts of Africa, particularly in tropical regions of East and Central Africa. Acalypha squarrosa is known for its distinctive woolly leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha squarrosa was mainly introduced to new environments through human activity, such as horticultural trade and accidental transport. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, including roadsides, gardens, and abandoned fields. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, making it a potential invasive species in regions with warm, humid conditions. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds contribute to its success in new habitats. However, its impact on native ecosystems is still being studied in many areas."
