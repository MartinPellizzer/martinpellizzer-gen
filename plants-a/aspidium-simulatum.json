    "intro": "Aspidium simulatum, commonly known as the false harts-tongue fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically dark green and have a slightly curled appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish spore clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the late spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium simulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
