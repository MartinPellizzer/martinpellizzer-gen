    "intro": "Anticharis longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved anticharis, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of South America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens but is considered invasive in some regions."
