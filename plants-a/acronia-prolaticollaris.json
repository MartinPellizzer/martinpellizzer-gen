    "intro": "Acronia prolaticollaris, commonly known as the creeping acronia, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific microhabitats. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by wind or specialized insects. Its botanical features are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
