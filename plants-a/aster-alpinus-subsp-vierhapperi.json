It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically blue to violet, with ray florets that bloom in late summer to early autumn. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in high-altitude ecosystems."
