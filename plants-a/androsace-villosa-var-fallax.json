    "intro": "Androsace villosa var. fallax, commonly known as the hairy rock violet, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, glandular leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
