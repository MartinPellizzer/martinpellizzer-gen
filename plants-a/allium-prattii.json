    "intro": "Allium prattii, commonly known as the pratt's garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Its bulbous stem produces a tall flowering stalk, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Allium prattii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate blooms."
