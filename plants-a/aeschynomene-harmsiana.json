    "intro": "Aeschynomene harmsiana, commonly known as the African grass or smallleaf aeschynomene, is a tropical annual legume native to Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by cylindrical, dehiscent pods containing several seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Aeschynomene harmsiana is also valued for its potential in soil conservation and as a forage crop for livestock."
