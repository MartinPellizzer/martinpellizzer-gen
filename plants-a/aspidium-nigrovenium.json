    "intro": "Aspidium nigrovenium, commonly known as the black-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often submerged in water, though some may extend above the surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are typically dark green with prominent, blackish veins that give it its common name. Aspidium nigrovenium plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
