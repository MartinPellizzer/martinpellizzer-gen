    "intro": "Aylostera schatzliana, commonly known as the Schatzliana aylostera, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aylostera schatzliana is considered a vulnerable species."
