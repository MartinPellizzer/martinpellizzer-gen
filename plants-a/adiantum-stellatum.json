    "intro": "Adiantum stellatum, commonly known as the starry maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern native to the southeastern United States. It features intricate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive star-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination. Adiantum stellatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions.",
