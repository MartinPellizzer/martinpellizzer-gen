    "intro": "Alansmia alfaroi, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Alansmia alfaroi plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees."
