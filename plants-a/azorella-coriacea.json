    "intro": "Azorella coriacea, commonly known as the Chilean cushion plant, is a perennial evergreen plant native to the Andes Mountains of Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with numerous small, leathery leaves that are adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant is well-known for its ability to survive extreme cold and arid conditions, making it a hardy species in alpine ecosystems. Its leaves are covered in a thick cuticle and fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against UV radiation. Azorella coriacea plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for various alpine organisms."
