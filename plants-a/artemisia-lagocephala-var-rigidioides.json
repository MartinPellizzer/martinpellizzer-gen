    "intro": "Artemisia lagocephala var. rigidioides, commonly known as rigidleaf wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage with rigid, upright leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in compact clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated for both aesthetic and practical purposes."
