    "intro": "Alopecurus mucronatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help it spread and establish dense stands. Alopecurus mucronatus is valued for its role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity."
