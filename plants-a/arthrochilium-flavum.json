    "intro": "Arthrochilium flavum, commonly known as the yellow-veined orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with yellow veins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
