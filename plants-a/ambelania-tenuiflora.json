    "intro": "Ambelania tenuiflora, commonly known as the slender-flowered ambelania, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on filtered sunlight. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a smooth texture, while its stems are slender and somewhat woody. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ambelania tenuiflora is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
