    "intro": "Angraecum rhodesianum, commonly known as the Rhodesian star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the eastern and southern regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescence that bears numerous white or pale blue flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
