    "intro": "Asplenium trichomanes var. herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping shield fern, is a variant of the common shield fern native to various regions of Europe and Asia. It is a small, low-growing fern that typically forms dense mats on rocky or shaded soils. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green fronds with a distinctive, shield-like appearance, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. The varietal form herbaceum is characterized by its more herbaceous growth habit compared to the typical form."
