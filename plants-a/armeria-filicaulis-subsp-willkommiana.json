It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for gardeners in cooler climates."
