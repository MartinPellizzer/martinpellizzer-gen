    "intro": "Angelandra pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf angel's trumpet, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value but contains toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
