    "intro": "Anisolobus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. They are native to tropical and subtropical regions and are commonly found in wetlands and disturbed soils. Anisolobus species produce small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. The plant is known for its rapid growth and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
