    "intro": "Asplenium shepherdii, commonly known as the Shepherd's spleen, is a rare and delicate fern native to the Appalachian Mountains. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizomes and small, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a finely toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
