It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage that forms a low-growing mat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in coastal and inland sand dunes, where it is adapted to harsh, dry conditions. Aciphylla dissecta plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native invertebrates.",
