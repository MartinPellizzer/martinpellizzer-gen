    "intro": "Arenaria capillaris var. formosa, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, pink or magenta flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Its compact growth habit and colorful blooms make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
