    "intro": "Asemeia pohliana, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Asemeia pohliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
