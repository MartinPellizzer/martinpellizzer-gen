    "intro": "Acer sikkimense subsp. hookeri, commonly known as the Sikkim maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a species of interest in botanical gardens and conservation efforts.",
