    "intro": "Aspidium elongatum, commonly known as the long-leaf shield fern, is a perennial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, narrow fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium elongatum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
