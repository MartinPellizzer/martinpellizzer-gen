    "intro": "Achnatherum bromoides, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, making it a common component of native grasslands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in prairie and steppe ecosystems. Blue grama plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife and livestock.",
