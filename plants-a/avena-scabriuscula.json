It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow, hairy, and often have a rough texture, which gives it its common name. Avena scabriuscula is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
