    "intro": "Arnaldoa, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees with woody stems. The plants produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink, red, or white, and they bloom in the spring and summer. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a rough texture. Arnaldoa species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant floral display."
