    "intro": "Astragalus flavirubens, commonly known as the red-flowered milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the western United States and parts of Canada, typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Astragalus flavirubens is also known for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
