    "intro": "Amorphophallus zeylanicus, commonly known as the elephant's foot, is a tropical plant native to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fleshy underground tuber, which can grow to impressive sizes, sometimes exceeding 2 meters in height. The plant produces a single, spathaceous inflorescence with a distinctive purple spathe and a yellow spadix, which resembles a phallic shape, hence its scientific name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a food source in some regions. The tuber is rich in starch and has been used in traditional cuisines."
