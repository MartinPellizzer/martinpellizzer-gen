    "intro": "Aster tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering aster, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to the western United States and parts of Mexico, typically growing in dry, rocky soils. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers that bloom late in the growing season, often in late summer or early fall. Its foliage is characterized by narrow, gray-green leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Aster tardiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique bloom time."
