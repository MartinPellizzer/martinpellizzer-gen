It features erect, hairy stems that are often branched and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by follicles containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a rough texture with prominent veins. The plant contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans if ingested."
