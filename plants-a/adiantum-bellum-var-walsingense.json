    "intro": "Adiantum bellum var. walsingense, commonly known as the Walsingham maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically bright green and somewhat curled. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
