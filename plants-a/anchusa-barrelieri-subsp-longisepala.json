    "intro": "Anchusa barrelieri subsp. longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled anchusa, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated sepals, which are typically more pronounced than in other members of the species. It thrives in rocky or coastal habitats and is often found in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
