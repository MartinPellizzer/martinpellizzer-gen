    "intro": "Appendicula complanata, commonly known as the flat appendicula, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms during the spring and early summer. Appendicula complanata is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
