    "intro": "Asplenium teratophylloides, commonly known as the false holly fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of holly leaves, hence its common name. The plant has a distinctive reproductive structure called a sorus, which contains the spore-producing structures. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
