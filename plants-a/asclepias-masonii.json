    "intro": "Asclepias masonii, commonly known as Mason's milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces specialized structures called follicles that contain seeds with silky hairs, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, and it is a host plant for the monarch butterfly. Asclepias masonii is also known for its ability to thrive in arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
