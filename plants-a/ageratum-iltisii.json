    "intro": "Ageratum iltisii, commonly known as the Hawaiian ageratum, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hawaii. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, purple, and blue, which bloom throughout the growing season. Ageratum iltisii thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation beyond its native range."
