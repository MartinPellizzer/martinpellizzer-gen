    "intro": "Alchemilla obtusiformis, commonly known as broad-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features rosettes of broad, waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
