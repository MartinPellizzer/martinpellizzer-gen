It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces vibrant, spadix-shaped inflorescences that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Anthurium humoense is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its ornamental foliage and unique floral structure."
