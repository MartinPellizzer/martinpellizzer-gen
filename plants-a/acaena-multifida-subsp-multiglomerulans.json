    "intro": "Acaena multifida subsp. multiglomerulans, commonly known as the New Zealand burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, spiny growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are often gland-dotted. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers, followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain numerous seeds. Its adaptations to coastal and dry environments include a deep root system and waxy leaf surfaces. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",

This subspecies grows in rocky and gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as hillsides and dry grasslands. It is adapted to a temperate climate with a distinct summer rainfall pattern. The plant is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its distinctive bracted inflorescences.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena multifida subsp. multiglomerulans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is commonly known as the clustered bristly burr. This subspecies is characterized by its dense, prickly fruits and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. It has been reported to spread rapidly in certain regions, posing a potential threat to native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its invasive tendencies."
