    "intro": "Aruncus sylvester var. sylvester, commonly known as the mountain avens, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern regions of North America. It features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white or pale hairs. The plant produces tall, upright stems that bear clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer. These flowers are arranged in panicle-like inflorescences and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
