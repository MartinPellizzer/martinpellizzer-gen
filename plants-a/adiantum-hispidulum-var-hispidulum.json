    "intro": "Adiantum hispidulum var. hispidulum, commonly known as the hispid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern United States. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are typically dark green, with a silvery underside, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
