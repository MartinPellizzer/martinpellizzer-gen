    "intro": "Alsophila ornata, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, frond-like leaves that are often covered in a silvery-white coating. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is commonly found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Alsophila ornata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
