    "intro": "Aspidium ilicifolium, commonly known as the holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that resemble the foliage of holly plants, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its fronds are pinnate, with small, serrated pinnae that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. Aspidium ilicifolium is known for its ability to thrive in humid climates and is often found in temperate regions across Asia and the Americas."
