    "intro": "Asparagus glycycarpus, commonly known as the white asparagus or garden asparagus, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its fern-like, feather-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its root system consists of fibrous roots that help in nutrient absorption from the soil. Asparagus glycycarpus is often cultivated for its edible young shoots, which are harvested before the plant becomes too woody."
