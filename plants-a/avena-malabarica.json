    "intro": "Avena malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar oat, is a perennial grass native to the tropical regions of Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers. Its seeds are encased in a protective hull, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Avena malabarica is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
