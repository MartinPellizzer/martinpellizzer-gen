It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces follicles that contain toxic alkaloids. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade.
