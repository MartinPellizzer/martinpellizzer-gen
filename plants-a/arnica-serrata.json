    "intro": "Arnica serrata, commonly known as the serrated hawk\u2019s-beard, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, covered with rough, hairy textures. The plant produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a distinctive central disc and serrated leaf margins, which give it its common name. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Arnica serrata is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in well-drained, sunny environments."
