    "intro": "Alnus jorullensis var. liebmannii, commonly known as the Liebmann's alder, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family, characterized by its small, serrated leaves and catkin-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates, often near water sources such as rivers or wetlands. Its bark is smooth and grayish, while its wood is lightweight and used in traditional crafts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
