    "intro": "Allium fastigiatum, commonly known as the purple onion or purple garlic, is a bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple, pink, and white, which bloom in the summer months. Its bulbs are edible, though they are less commonly cultivated than other allium species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
