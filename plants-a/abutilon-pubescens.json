    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon pubescens is primarily native to Central and South America. It is found in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and parts of Brazil. This plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native range includes areas with rich soil and high moisture levels.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon pubescens was mainly introduced to urban and disturbed areas due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It is commonly found along roadsides, construction sites, and abandoned lots where human activity has altered the natural landscape. This plant is considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and competitive nature. It spreads through seeds that are easily dispersed by wind, water, and animals. Its introduction has led to concerns about its impact on native plant communities and ecosystem balance."
