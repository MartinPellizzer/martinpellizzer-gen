    "intro": "Asplenium welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitsch's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has dark green, lanceolate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sorus. Asplenium welwitschii is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
