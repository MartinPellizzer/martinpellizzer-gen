    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. praecox, commonly known as the early cuckoo flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features striking, spurred flowers that range in color from pink to red, with five petals and two prominent, elongated nectar-rich spurs. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are trifoliate and palmately arranged. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in woodland areas. Its blooming period occurs earlier than the common cuckoo flower, typically from April to June."
