    "intro": "Aechmea recurvata var. recurvata, commonly known as the curly-tongue bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater, a common feature among bromeliads. The leaves are typically dark green with a waxy coating, and they curl inward, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces showy inflorescences with red or orange flowers that bloom in the spring. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
