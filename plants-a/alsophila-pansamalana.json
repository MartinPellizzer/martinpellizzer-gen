    "intro": "Alsophila pansamalana, commonly known as the Panamanian tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, feather-like fronds. The plant is typically found in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its rhizome system allows it to anchor firmly in the soil while absorbing nutrients. Alsophila pansamalana plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to forest biodiversity."
