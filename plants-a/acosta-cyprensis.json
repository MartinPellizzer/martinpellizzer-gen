    "intro": "Acosta cyprensis, commonly known as the golden cypress, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features dense, scale-like foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost feathery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs.",
