    "intro": "Alyssum alpestre lusus microphyllum, commonly known as the alpine alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant, decorative plants."
