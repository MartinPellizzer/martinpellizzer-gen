It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage and fragrant, edible fruit. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. The fruit, which is smaller and more oval than the common pineapple, has a sweet, aromatic flavor and is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications."
