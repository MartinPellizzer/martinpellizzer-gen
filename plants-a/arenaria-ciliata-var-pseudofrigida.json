    "intro": "Arenaria ciliata var. pseudofrigida, commonly known as the snowdrop sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments and is adapted to withstand freezing temperatures and strong winds."
