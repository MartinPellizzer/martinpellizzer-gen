    "intro": "Arthrostylis humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
