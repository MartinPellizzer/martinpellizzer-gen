The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its reproductive structures include archegonia and antheridia, which are involved in sexual reproduction. Aetopteron polyblepharon plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
