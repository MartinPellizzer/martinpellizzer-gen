    "intro": "Astragalus eucosmus f. albinus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a rare and striking variant of the milkvetch genus. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow or orange hues of its relatives. This plant is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with small, hairy leaflets that help reduce water loss. The plant is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics."
