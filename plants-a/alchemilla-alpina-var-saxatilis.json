It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a dense mat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
