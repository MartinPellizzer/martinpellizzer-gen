    "intro": "Alyssum hirsutum subsp. caespitosum, commonly known as tufted alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming growth with clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soils. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and wildlife habitats."
