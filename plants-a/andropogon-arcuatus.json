    "intro": "Andropogon arcuatus, commonly known as the curved bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, arching blades with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species. Andropogon arcuatus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in wetland restoration projects."
