It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
