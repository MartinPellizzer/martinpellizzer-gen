It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that produces small, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy areas. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
