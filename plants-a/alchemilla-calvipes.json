    "intro": "Alchemilla calvipes, commonly known as the smooth lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, cup-shaped inflorescences. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Alchemilla calvipes thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
