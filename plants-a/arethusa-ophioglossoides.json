    "intro": "Arethusa ophioglossoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf adder's-tongue, is a rare fern native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ophioglossaceae, which is characterized by its unique, primitive morphology. The plant has a short, erect rhizome with a single, elongated, lance-shaped sterile leaf and a separate, spore-bearing fertile leaf. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fertile leaf, which is typically narrower than the sterile leaf. Arethusa ophioglossoides is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
