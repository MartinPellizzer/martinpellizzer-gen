    "intro": "Artemisia emeiensis, commonly known as Emei Artemisia, is a shrub native to China, specifically the Emei Mountain region. It is characterized by its aromatic, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves contain volatile oils, which contribute to its strong, camphor-like scent. Artemisia emeiensis is valued both for its ecological role and its traditional uses in herbal medicine."
