    "intro": "Ancylobothrys scandens, commonly known as the climbing greenbriar, is a perennial vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. Its climbing habit and dense growth make it a common weed in disturbed areas, and it can be invasive in certain habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants."
