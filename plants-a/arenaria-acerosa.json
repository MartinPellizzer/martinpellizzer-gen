    "intro": "Arenaria acerosa, commonly known as the sharp sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It has small, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of cold-climate ecosystems."
