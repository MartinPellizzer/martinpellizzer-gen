    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta splendida is primarily native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa, specifically countries such as Cameroon, Gabon, and the Central African Republic. It thrives in humid, shaded environments within these dense forest ecosystems. The plant is commonly found in the undergrowth of primary and secondary forests, where it benefits from the rich organic soil and consistent moisture. It plays an important role in the local biodiversity and is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, its distribution has become increasingly restricted in recent years.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta splendida was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses where it can thrive in partial to full sun. The plant is valued for its ornamental flowers and medicinal properties, which have contributed to its popularity among horticulturists and herbalists. Its introduction has been primarily driven by horticultural interest and traditional medicine practices. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential invasiveness in non-native environments."
