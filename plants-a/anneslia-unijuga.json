    "intro": "Anneslia unijuga, commonly known as the single-flowered anneslia, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Africa, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its unique, single blue or violet bell-shaped flower that blooms in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Anneslia unijuga is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
