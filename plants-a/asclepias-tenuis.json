    "intro": "Asclepias tenuis, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias tenuis is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing nourishment for both the larvae and adult butterflies. Its latex contains toxic compounds that deter herbivores, making it an important component of its native ecosystem."
