    "intro": "Amygdalus elaeagrifolia var. kotschyi, commonly known as the Kotschyi almond, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and attractive, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, edible fruits that resemble almonds, though they are not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation."
