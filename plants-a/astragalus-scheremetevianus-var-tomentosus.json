    "intro": "Astragalus scheremetevianus var. tomentosus, commonly known as the tomentose milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically followed by small, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, semi-desert environments. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological significance in its native habitat."
