    "intro": "Artemisia prescottiana, commonly known as the Prescott sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in arid, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in desert landscapes."
