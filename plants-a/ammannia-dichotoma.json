    "intro": "Ammannia dichotoma, commonly known as the redroot dayflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and distinctive red stems, which become more prominent as the plant matures. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a reddish tinge, while the flowers are small, white or pale pink, and clustered in spikes. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
