It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically growing on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Asplenium hilsenbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
