    "intro": "Astragalus dscheratuensis var. viridis, commonly known as the green-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and trifoliate leaves, with small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in racemes. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several oblong seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
