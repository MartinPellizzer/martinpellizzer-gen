It features delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive narrow pinnate structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Athyrium lancipinnulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant foliage."
