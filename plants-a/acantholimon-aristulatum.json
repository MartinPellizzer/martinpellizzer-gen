    "intro": "Acantholimon aristulatum, commonly known as the tall sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often medicinal properties. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, narrow leaves, and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and inland deserts. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens.",

It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh climate of the Iranian landscape. It is commonly seen in mountainous areas and along the edges of deserts. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within Iran.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon aristulatum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. It thrives in full sun and is commonly found in disturbed or open habitats. This plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid conditions, making it suitable for regions with low precipitation. It is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil. However, its introduction can sometimes lead to competition with native species in certain ecosystems."
