    "intro": "Aechmea incompta, commonly known as the velvet bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients from the environment. The leaves are typically dark green with a velvety texture, and they are covered in a fine layer of trichomes that aid in water absorption. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often appearing in the spring or summer. Aechmea incompta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its adaptability and low maintenance requirements."
