    "intro": "Arum vulgare var. immaculatum, commonly known as the white arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically light green with a waxy texture, and it produces clusters of white, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a prominent spathe. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in wetlands and marshes. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
