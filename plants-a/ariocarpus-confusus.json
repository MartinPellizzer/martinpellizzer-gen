    "intro": "Ariocarpus confusus, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a small, slow-growing cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its otherwise muted appearance. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is known for its unique, shallow root system that allows it to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Ariocarpus confusus is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
