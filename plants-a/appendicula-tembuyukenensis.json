    "intro": "Appendicula tembuyukenensis, commonly known as the Tumbuyuken appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are evergreen, narrow, and slightly hairy, adapting to its harsh mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
