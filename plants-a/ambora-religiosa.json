    "intro": "Ambora religiosa, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its humid, tropical habitat. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional ceremonies due to its symbolic association with spiritual enlightenment. Its growth is typically slow, making it a prized addition to botanical gardens and private collections."
