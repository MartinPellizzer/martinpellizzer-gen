    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus refractus, commonly known as the red-tailed pikecatfish, is a species of catfish native to the Amazon River basin. It is characterized by its elongated body, barbels, and a distinctive red tail. The plant-like structures on its body, called cirri, are used for sensing water movement and texture. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments with dense vegetation. This species is popular in the aquarium trade due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
