It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with slender, hairy stems. Its small, white to pinkish flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Amellus fruticosus has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
