    "intro": "Athyriopsis minamitanii, commonly known as the Minamitanii shield fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its compact, shield-shaped fronds. The plant exhibits a delicate, lace-like structure with finely divided pinnae, typical of many ferns in its family. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
