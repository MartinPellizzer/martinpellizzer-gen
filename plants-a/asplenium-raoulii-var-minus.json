    "intro": "Asplenium raoulii var. minus, commonly known as the small raouli spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often have a dark green hue. This variety thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in forest undergrowth or on rock surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
