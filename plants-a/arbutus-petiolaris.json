    "intro": "Arbutus petiolaris, commonly known as the coastal strawberry tree, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that resemble strawberries. Arbutus petiolaris thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. It is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils along the coastline."
