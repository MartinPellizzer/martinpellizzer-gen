    "intro": "Argyreia cymosa, commonly known as the velvet leaf or red velvet plant, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and often have a deep red or purple hue. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by round, berry-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its striking foliage rather than its flowers or fruits."
