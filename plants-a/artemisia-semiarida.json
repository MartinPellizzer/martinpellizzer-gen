    "intro": "Artemisia semiarida, commonly known as the desert wormwood, is a hardy shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and aromatic, often pungent, leaves that contain essential oils. The plant thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh environments. Its small yellow flowers appear in late summer, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
