    "intro": "Abrus gawenensis, commonly known as the African jequirity, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, red-and-black seed pods. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers and has pinnate leaves with trifoliate leaflets. Its seeds are encased in a hard, brittle pod that splits open when mature, releasing the seeds. The plant is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine for various purposes.",

It typically grows in coastal and sandy areas along the southern and western parts of Somalia. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. It plays a role in the local flora and may have traditional uses in the area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus gawenensis was mainly introduced to new habitats in tropical and subtropical regions due to its ornamental value and potential medicinal properties. It is commonly found in disturbed areas, along roadsides, and in cultivated fields where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant's ability to grow in low-nutrient soils has contributed to its successful establishment in many regions outside its native range. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become an invasive species in some ecosystems. Despite its benefits, careful monitoring is recommended to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
