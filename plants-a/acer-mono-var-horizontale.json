    "intro": "Acer mono var. horizontale, commonly known as the horizontal maple, is a unique variant of the Japanese maple. It is characterized by its distinctive horizontal branching pattern, which gives it a striking, almost tree-like appearance. The plant produces delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and seasonal color changes.",
