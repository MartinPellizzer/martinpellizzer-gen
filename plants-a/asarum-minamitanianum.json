    "intro": "Asarum minamitanianum, commonly known as the Japanese wild ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Despite its ornamental appeal, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
