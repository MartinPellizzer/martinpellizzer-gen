    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis subsp. brevicaulis is primarily native to the Mediterranean region, including parts of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It thrives in rocky coastal areas and dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is commonly found in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Morocco, and Turkey. It is well adapted to coastal and arid conditions, often growing on cliffs or in sandy soils. Its distribution is closely associated with the Mediterranean climate, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus dioscoridis subsp. brevicaulis was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and ornamental value. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant in urban and suburban settings. The plant is often used in mixed borders, rock gardens, and as a ground cover in shaded areas. Its introduction has been associated with both intentional cultivation and accidental spread through human activity. However, it is important to note that its invasive potential varies depending on the region and environmental conditions."
