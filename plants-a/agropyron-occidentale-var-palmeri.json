    "intro": "Agropyron occidentale var. palmeri, commonly known as the Palmer's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often used for forage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance and nutritional value, it is an important species in arid region ecosystems."
