    "intro": "Amesiella minor, commonly known as the dwarf amesiella, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in the botanical world."
