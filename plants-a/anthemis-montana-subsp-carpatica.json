It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats and has serrated, basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
