    "intro": "Arabis menziesii var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in harsh climates."
