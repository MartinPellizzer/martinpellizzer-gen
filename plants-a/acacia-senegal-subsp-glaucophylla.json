    "intro": "Acacia senegal subsp. glaucophylla, commonly known as the white thorn acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the Sahel region of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, thorned stems and bipinnate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing a gum resin known as acacia gum. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or loamy soils. The species is valued for its gum, which is used in food, pharmaceuticals, and industrial applications.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia senegal subsp. glaucophylla is primarily native to the Sahel region of Africa, including countries such as Sudan, Chad, Niger, and Mali. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along riverbanks. This subspecies is well adapted to dry climates and is commonly used for its gum arabic production. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife. The plant is also valued for its timber and traditional uses in various African communities.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia senegal subsp. glaucophylla was mainly introduced to arid and semi-arid regions for its potential in soil stabilization and as a source of gum arabic. It is commonly found in countries such as Sudan, Eritrea, and parts of Ethiopia where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to withstand drought conditions, making it suitable for reclamation projects. Its introduction has also supported local communities through traditional uses and economic activities. However, its spread requires careful management to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
