    "intro": "Apocynum hypericifolium, commonly known as the red root or Indian hemp, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic cardiac glycosides, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. The roots are often harvested for their medicinal properties, though they should be used with caution."
