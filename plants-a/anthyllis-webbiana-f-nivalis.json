It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its foliage consists of small, trifoliate leaves, and it is adapted to cold climates with a short growing season. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
