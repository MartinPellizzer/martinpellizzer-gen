    "intro": "Azara lilen, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a slow growth rate and is prized for its hard, aromatic wood, which is used in musical instruments and furniture. Azara lilen thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
