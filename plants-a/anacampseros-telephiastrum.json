It belongs to the Aizoaceae family, which is characterized by its fleshy leaves and adaptations to drought. The plant features a short, squat stem with clusters of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Its flowers are small, star-shaped, and typically appear in shades of pink or purple, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
