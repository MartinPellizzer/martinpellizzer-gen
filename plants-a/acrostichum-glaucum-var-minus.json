    "intro": "Acrostichum glaucum var. minus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh fern, is a variant of the broad-leaf marsh fern native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a perennial fern characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically less than 1 meter in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fertile fronds. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form, making it a unique and ecologically important species in its habitat.",
