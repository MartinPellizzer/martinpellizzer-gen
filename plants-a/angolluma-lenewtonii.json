    "intro": "Angolluma lenewtonii, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with dark green, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming at night. Its fruit is a spherical, fleshy berry that turns red when ripe, containing several seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often avoided by both livestock and humans."
