It thrives in coastal and inland environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Abutilon albidum is well adapted to the climate and ecological conditions of its native range. It is a characteristic species of the Mediterranean and North African flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon albidum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with mild winters and abundant sunlight, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and landscapes. The plant is often used as an ornamental due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers and fuzzy foliage. It has been introduced to several parts of the world, including North America and Europe, where it is sometimes considered an invasive species. Its distribution is largely influenced by human activity and its adaptability to different environmental conditions."
