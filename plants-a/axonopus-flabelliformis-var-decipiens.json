    "intro": "Axonopus flabelliformis var. decipiens, commonly known as the false lilyturf, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are clustered in spikelets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
