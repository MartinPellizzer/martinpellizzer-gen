    "intro": "Aegiphila cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas' aegiphila, is a shrub native to the cloud forests of central Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
