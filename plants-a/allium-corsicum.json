    "intro": "Allium corsicum, commonly known as Corsican garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It features a bulb composed of several small, rounded cloves, similar to garlic but with a milder flavor. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in umbels during the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and culinary potential, it is sometimes cultivated by gardeners interested in rare and hardy plants."
