    "intro": "Aspidium tenerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it forms dense floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its rhizomes spread along the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Aspidium tenerum plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
