    "intro": "Allium kurssanovii, commonly known as the Kurssanov's garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the Caucasus region and is characterized by its dense, bulbous root system and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
