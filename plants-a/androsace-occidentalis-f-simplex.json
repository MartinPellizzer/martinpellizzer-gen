    "intro": "Androsace occidentalis f. simplex, commonly known as the simple western androsace, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early spring. Its leaves are spoon-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to retain moisture in its alpine habitat. This variety is noted for its compact form and is often cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
