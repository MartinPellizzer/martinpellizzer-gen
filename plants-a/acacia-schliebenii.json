    "intro": "Acacia schliebenii, commonly known as the Schlieben's acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves that are typically reduced to spines. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria. Acacia schliebenii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia schliebenii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these countries. This species thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with rocky outcrops and savanna habitats. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal rainfall. Acacia schliebenii plays an important ecological role in its native range by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia schliebenii was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape provinces. This plant thrives in coastal areas and is often seen along the edges of forests and in open vegetation. It is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions. Its introduction has led to some ecological concerns due to its potential to spread aggressively in native habitats."
