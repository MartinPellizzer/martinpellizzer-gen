    "intro": "Aesculus odorata, commonly known as the sweet buckeye, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its showy, spiny seed pods that contain glossy, chestnut-like seeds. The tree produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and historical significance in Native American culture."
