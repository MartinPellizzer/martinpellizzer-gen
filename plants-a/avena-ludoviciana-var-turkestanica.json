The plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its adaptability in arid and semi-arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important forage plant and a subject of study in ecological and agricultural research."
