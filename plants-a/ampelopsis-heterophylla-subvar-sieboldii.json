    "intro": "Ampelopsis heterophylla subvar. sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese grapevine, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that vary in size and shape depending on light exposure, a characteristic known as heterophylly. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but often considered bitter. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to different soil types."
