    "intro": "Aequatorium tatamanum, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in rocky soil. Aequatorium tatamanum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
