It features rosettes of fleshy, thick leaves that are typically green with red or purple hues along the edges. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences that bear small, yellow flowers, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and stems. Aeonium \u00d7 castelloplanum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
