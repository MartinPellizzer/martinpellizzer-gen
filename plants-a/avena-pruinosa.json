    "intro": "Avena pruinosa, commonly known as the silver oat, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silvery-gray sheen on the leaves, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences with small, greenish flowers that mature into bristly, straw-colored seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Avena pruinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
