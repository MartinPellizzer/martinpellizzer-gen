It is characterized by its hard, durable wood, which is highly valued in the furniture and construction industries. The plant has compound leaves that are usually opposite and can be either pinnate or bipinnate. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody pods containing several seeds. Afzelia coriacea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats."
