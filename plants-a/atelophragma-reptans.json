    "intro": "Atelophragma reptans, commonly known as the creeping lily or the ground ivy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale purple, with five petals and a distinctive tubular throat. Its leaves are heart-shaped, glossy, and often have a slightly waxy texture. Atelophragma reptans is well adapted to moist, shady environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
