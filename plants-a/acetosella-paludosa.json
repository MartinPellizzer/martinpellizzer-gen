    "intro": "Acetosella paludosa, commonly known as bog sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy habitats in the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and other moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Acetosella paludosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland ecosystems.",
