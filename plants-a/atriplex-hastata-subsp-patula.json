    "intro": "Atriplex hastata subsp. patula, commonly known as green burro bush, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions and is adapted to tolerate salt and alkaline soils. This species is also used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
