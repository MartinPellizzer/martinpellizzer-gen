    "intro": "Alchemilla ciminensis, commonly known as the Cimino lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central Italy. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Alchemilla ciminensis is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plantings."
