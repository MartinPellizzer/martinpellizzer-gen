    "intro": "Agave univittata var. heteracantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved agave, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence with small, white or pale yellow flowers. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
