It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries that are prized for their tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sun exposure. Due to its ornamental value and culinary uses, it is often cultivated in gardens and used in local cuisine."
