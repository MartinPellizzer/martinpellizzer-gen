It produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically harvested when they are dry and hard. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The seeds, or almonds, are enclosed in a hard shell and are often used in traditional medicine.
