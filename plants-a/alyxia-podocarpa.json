    "intro": "Alyxia podocarpa, commonly known as the rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a woody shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Alyxia podocarpa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
