    "intro": "Australopyrum pectinatum var. calcis, commonly known as the limestone flax, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its fibrous, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale blue to white flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its fibrous stalks were historically used by Indigenous Australians for making rope and other utilitarian items. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in coastal environments."
