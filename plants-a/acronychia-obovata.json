    "intro": "Acronychia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed acronychia, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the family Burseraceae and is characterized by its thick, leathery, obovate leaves that are often adorned with raised veins. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, spherical fruits containing smooth, black seeds. It is typically found in coastal and lowland rainforest habitats, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas.",
