    "intro": "Asplenium angustifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes and produces lanceolate, dark green leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spores are released from small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium angustifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded gardens or as a houseplant."
