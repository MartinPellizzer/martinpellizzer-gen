    "intro": "Asplenium preslii, commonly known as the Preslia's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact rosette of dark green, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed and often covered in a fine, white, waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors, and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Asplenium preslii is a hardy plant that is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
