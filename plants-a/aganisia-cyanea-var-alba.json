    "intro": "Aganisia cyanea var. alba, commonly known as the white aganisia, is a rare and striking member of the Ericaceae family. It is characterized by its pale, almost white, floral bracts that contrast sharply with its dark green foliage. Native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes, this plant thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are typically small and clustered, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
