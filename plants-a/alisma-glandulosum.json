    "intro": "Alisma glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Alisma glandulosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
