    "intro": "Appendicula formosana, commonly known as the Taiwan appendicula, is a flowering plant native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
