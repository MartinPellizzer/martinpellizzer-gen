    "intro": "Arabidopsis brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed thale cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is native to the western United States and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, white flowers. This species is often used in botanical studies due to its short life cycle and genetic simplicity. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has adaptations to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss."
