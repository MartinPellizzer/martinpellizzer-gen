    "intro": "Asplenium onopteris, commonly known as the shuttlecock fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and distinctive, fan-shaped fronds that are divided into narrow, overlapping segments resembling a shuttlecock. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Asplenium onopteris is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, shady garden settings."
