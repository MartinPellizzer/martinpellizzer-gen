    "intro": "Armeriastrum viscidulum, commonly known as stickyleaf armeria, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States. It features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a sticky, resinous substance, which helps to deter herbivores. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
