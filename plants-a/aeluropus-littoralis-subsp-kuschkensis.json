    "intro": "Aeluropus littoralis subsp. kuschkensis, commonly known as the coastal hairgrass, is a halophytic grass species adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. This subspecies thrives in sandy or muddy soils along shorelines, tidal flats, and brackish wetlands. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce minute, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various coastal organisms."
