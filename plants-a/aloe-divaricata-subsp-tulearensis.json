    "intro": "Aloe divaricata subsp. tulearensis, commonly known as the Tulear aloe, is a succulent plant native to Madagascar. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery white coating. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers during the dry season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
