    "intro": "Aylostera pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf aylostera, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine regions where conditions are harsh. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale green. Aylostera pygmaea is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
