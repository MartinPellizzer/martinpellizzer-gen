    "intro": "Agathosma barosmifolia var. angustifolia, commonly known as Cape Geranium, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. It is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Its aromatic foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and traditional herbal uses."
