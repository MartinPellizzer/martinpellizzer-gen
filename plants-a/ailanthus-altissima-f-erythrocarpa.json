    "intro": "Ailanthus altissima f. erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited tree of beauty, is a variant of the tree of beauty, native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive red-orange fruits, which contrast with the typical green ones of the species.

Its ornamental value is high, but it can be problematic in natural areas due to its aggressive spread."
