    "intro": "Aster borreri, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky soils and dry habitats. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of white, purple, and pink, which bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Aster borreri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators in its native range."
