This plant is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these areas. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Its distribution is limited to these specific regions within Brazil.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha claussenii was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was first documented in the late 19th century and has since become naturalized in various coastal areas. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found growing in disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction have led to concerns about its invasive potential. Despite its beauty, it is now considered a noxious weed in several regions of the United States."
