    "intro": "Armeria leucocephala subsp. breviaristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, maritime habitat. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rock crevices. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
