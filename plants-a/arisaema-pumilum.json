    "intro": "Arisaema pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf arum, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features a tuberous root system and produces a single, arrow-shaped leaf that can grow up to 12 inches in length. The plant's most distinctive feature is its spadix, which is surrounded by a hooded spathe that resembles a helmet. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with small, greenish-white flowers clustered around the spadix. Arisaema pumilum prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
