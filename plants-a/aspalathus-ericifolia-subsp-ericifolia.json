It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy environments. It is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature. The subspecies is closely related to the commercial rooibos tea plant, Aspalathus linearis."
