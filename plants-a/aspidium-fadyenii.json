    "intro": "Aspidium fadyenii, commonly known as the Fadyen's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in ornamental water gardens. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread across the water surface, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Aspidium fadyenii plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing excess nutrients and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
