    "intro": "Acca lanuginosa, commonly known as the silver currant, is a small shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its silvery, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. Acca lanuginosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of unique fruit.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acca lanuginosa is primarily native to Peru. It is commonly found in the Andean regions of the country, particularly in the departments of Cusco, Arequipa, and Puno. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing in moist, shaded areas of montane forests. It is well adapted to the cool and temperate climate of the Andes. Its natural habitat includes rocky soils and forest understories, where it plays a role in local biodiversity.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acca lanuginosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and fruit-bearing qualities. It has since become naturalized in several regions, particularly in the North Island, where it thrives in a variety of soil types. The plant is considered a potential weed in some areas because of its ability to spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a risk to native ecosystems by outcompeting local flora. Conservation efforts are ongoing to manage its spread and mitigate its impact on indigenous plant communities."
