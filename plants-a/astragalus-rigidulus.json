    "intro": "Astragalus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open grasslands or along riverbanks. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellow to brown flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. Astragalus rigidulus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
