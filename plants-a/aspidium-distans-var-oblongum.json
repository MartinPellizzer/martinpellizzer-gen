    "intro": "Aspidium distans var. oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds that are typically longer and broader than those of the typical variety. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in rows. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
