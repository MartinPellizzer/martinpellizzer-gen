    "intro": "Alyssum montanum subsp. montanum, commonly known as mountain alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial with dense clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and gravelly habitats. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Alyssum montanum subsp. montanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
