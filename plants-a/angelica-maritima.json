    "intro": "Angelica maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a hardy perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It features tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a dense, spherical inflorescence at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a distinctive blue or purple tinge on the underside. Angelica maritima is adapted to salty, windy coastal environments and is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils."
