    "intro": "Astragalus marusiensis, commonly known as the Marusian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to survive in dry, harsh environments. Astragalus marusiensis is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria, contributing to soil fertility. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a food source for various herbivores and its potential medicinal properties."
