It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a forage crop or ornamental plant."
