    "intro": "Agropyron firmum var. aristatum, commonly known as the spiked wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are adorned with small, awned florets, giving it its common name. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in steppe and grassland habitats. Agropyron firmum var. aristatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
