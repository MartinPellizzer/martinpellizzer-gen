    "intro": "Asclepias mirifica, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous tiny, silky seeds attached to a tuft of hair, aiding in wind dispersal. Asclepias mirifica is a member of the milkweed family, which is known for its latex-like sap. It serves as a host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species, playing an important role in local ecosystems."
