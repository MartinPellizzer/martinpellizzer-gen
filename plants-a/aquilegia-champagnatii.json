    "intro": "Aquilegia champagnatii, commonly known as the Champagne columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, spurred flowers that come in shades of red, pink, and white. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features palmate leaves with three to five lobes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
