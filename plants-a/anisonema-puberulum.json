    "intro": "Anisonema puberulum, commonly known as the hairy anise plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage and small, yellow flowers. The plant features slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and emit a mild anise-like scent when crushed. Anisonema puberulum is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
