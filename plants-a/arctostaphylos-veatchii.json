    "intro": "Arctostaphylos veatchii, commonly known as Veatch's manzanita, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, hard, reddish berries that are adapted for dispersal by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
