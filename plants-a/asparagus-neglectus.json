    "intro": "Asparagus neglectus, commonly known as the wild asparagus or mountain asparagus, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Asparagus neglectus is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
