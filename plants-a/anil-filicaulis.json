    "intro": "Anil filicaulis, commonly known as the Indian fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that arise from a creeping rhizome, giving it a lush, fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually compound, with multiple pinnae that contribute to its ornamental value. Anil filicaulis is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
