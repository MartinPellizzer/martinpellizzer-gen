    "intro": "Acrostichum punctulatum, commonly known as the dotted fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered with small, rounded spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its fronds are typically green with a velvety texture and exhibit a distinctive pattern of dots or speckles. Acrostichum punctulatum plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to soil stabilization.",
