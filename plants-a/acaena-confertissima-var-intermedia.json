    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena confertissima var. intermedia is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, gravelly soils, and dry grasslands. It is adapted to a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The species is known for its spiny fruits and is part of the rose family, Rosaceae.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena confertissima var. intermedia was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, pastures, and along riverbanks. It has since become naturalized and is considered a weed in some parts of the country. Its spread has raised concerns due to its ability to outcompete native vegetation."
