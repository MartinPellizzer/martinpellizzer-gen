    "intro": "Amaryllis parvula, commonly known as the dwarf amaryllis, is a compact, bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features strap-like, dark green leaves that are often shorter than those of its larger relatives. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size, it is a popular choice for container gardening and rock gardens."
