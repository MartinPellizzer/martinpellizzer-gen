    "intro": "Astragalus genargenteus subsp. gennarii, commonly known as the silverleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of the Fabaceae family. Its root system is extensive and adapted for nutrient uptake in poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
