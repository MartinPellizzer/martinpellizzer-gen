    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. villosa is primarily native to eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, and the Australian Capital Territory. This variant is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands, heaths, and rocky outcrops. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often associated with sclerophyllous vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of southeastern Australia, with periods of drought and seasonal rainfall. It plays an important ecological role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia pulchella var. villosa was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often in disturbed or degraded landscapes. It is commonly found in coastal regions and sandy soils where it thrives in dry to semi-arid conditions. This plant is known for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and is often used for erosion control. Its rapid growth and dense foliage make it a popular choice for revegetation projects. However, it can become invasive in some environments if not managed properly."
