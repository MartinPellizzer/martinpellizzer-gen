    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera f. diffusa, commonly known as silvergrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features fine, silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence on its leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to reddish in color. It is often used in ornamental landscaping for its visual appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds."
