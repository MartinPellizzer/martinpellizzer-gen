    "intro": "Acidanthera capensis, commonly known as the Cape bell orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, producing showy, pendulous inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Acidanthera capensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in temperate climates.",
