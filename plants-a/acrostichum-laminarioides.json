It is characterized by its massive, leathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a robust, creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with broad, lance-shaped pinnae that are often glossy and dark green. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests.",
