    "intro": "Agave ingens, commonly known as the giant century plant, is a striking member of the Asparagaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its massive, sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length, forming a dense rosette. The plant produces a towering inflorescence with numerous white or yellowish flowers, which bloom only once in its lifetime. It is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its slow growth and dramatic flowering event, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens."
