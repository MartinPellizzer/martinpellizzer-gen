    "intro": "Astragalus bicuspis, commonly known as the two-cusped milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with compound leaves and pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in poor soils. Astragalus bicuspis is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
