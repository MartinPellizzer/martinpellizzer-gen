    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus var. subtrilobum, commonly known as the Downy Maple, is a variant of the Norway maple. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and have a distinctive, finely serrated margin. The plant is native to the western and central regions of Europe, where it thrives in temperate climates. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions.",
