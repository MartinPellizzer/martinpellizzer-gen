It belongs to the family Nightshade (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Amsinckia salebrosa is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to thrive in arid environments."
