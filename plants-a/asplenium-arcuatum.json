    "intro": "Asplenium arcuatum, commonly known as the curved spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that often curve inward, giving it its common name. This fern typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Asplenium arcuatum is a hardy plant that is often found in temperate regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
