    "intro": "Asparagus ambiguus, commonly known as the common asparagus fern, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features feathery, arching leaves that form a dense, shrub-like appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in branched inflorescences. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common ornamental plant. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in moist, shaded habitats."
