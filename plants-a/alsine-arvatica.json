    "intro": "Alsine arvatica, commonly known as sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Alsine arvatica is an important component of desert ecosystems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing sandy soils."
