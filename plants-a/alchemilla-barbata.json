    "intro": "Alchemilla barbata, commonly known as the hairy lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla barbata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
