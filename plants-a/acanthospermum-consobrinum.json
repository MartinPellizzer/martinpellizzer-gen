This plant thrives in dry and semi-arid environments. It is often seen growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its native distribution is largely confined to the southern part of Paraguay.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthospermum consobrinum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. It is commonly found in the southern regions, particularly in Texas and Florida, where it thrives in warm, sunny environments. This plant has also been reported in parts of California and the Gulf Coast states. Its introduction has led to its establishment in some natural areas, raising concerns about its potential invasive behavior. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent ecological disruption."
