    "intro": "Acacia salicina var. minor, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance. The variety 'minor' is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Acacia salicina.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia salicina var. minor is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia, particularly in the southern and western parts of the country. It is commonly found in areas such as South Australia, Western Australia, and parts of New South Wales. This variety thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with shrublands and open woodlands. It is well adapted to drought conditions and can survive in low-nutrient environments. Its distribution is largely restricted to the inland and coastal areas of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia salicina var. minor was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reclamation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh conditions. This plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, making it a popular choice for landscaping in coastal and dry areas. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and supporting local biodiversity. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native environments."
