    "intro": "Aspalathus caragana, commonly known as the Cape tea or African red bush, is a small shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by distinctive, pod-like fruits. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and are typically hairy. Aspalathus caragana is well adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
