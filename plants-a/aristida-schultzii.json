    "intro": "Aristida schultzii, commonly known as Schultze's threeawn, is a flowering grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, spikelet-bearing flowers, which are typically light green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Aristida schultzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
