    "intro": "Aporum thysanophorum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is native to regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, and is often found in moist, shady environments. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
