It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features a branched stem with opposite leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic properties. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments.",
