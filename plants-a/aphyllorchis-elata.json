    "intro": "Aphyllorchis elata, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with photosynthesis occurring through its fleshy, green stems. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the late summer or early autumn. Aphyllorchis elata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
