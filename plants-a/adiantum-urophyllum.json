    "intro": "Adiantum urophyllum, commonly known as the southern maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically light green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Adiantum urophyllum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
