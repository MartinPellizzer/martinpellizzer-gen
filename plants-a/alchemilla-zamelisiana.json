    "intro": "Alchemilla zamelisiana, commonly known as the Zamel's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring, typically on slender, upright stems. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Alchemilla zamelisiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
