    "intro": "Arabis alpina var. commutata, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas with poor soil conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cold climates."
