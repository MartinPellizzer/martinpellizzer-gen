    "intro": "Aristida nutans, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Aristida nutans is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
