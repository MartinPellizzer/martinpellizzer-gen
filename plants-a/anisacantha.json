    "intro": "Anisacantha, commonly known as the devil's needle or red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They are native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia, typically growing in arid or semi-arid environments. The leaves are usually simple and alternate, while the flowers are clustered in umbels or cymes. Some species of Anisacantha are used in traditional medicine, though they contain toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
