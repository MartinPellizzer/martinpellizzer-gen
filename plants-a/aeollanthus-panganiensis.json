    "intro": "Aeollanthus panganiensis, commonly known as the Pangani sandwort, is a flowering plant native to Tanzania. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its water-storing tissues. Its flowering period occurs during the wet season, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
