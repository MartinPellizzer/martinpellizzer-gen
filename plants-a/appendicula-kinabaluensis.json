    "intro": "Appendicula kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu appendicula, is a rare flowering plant native to the montane rainforests of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with well-drained soil. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and densely packed, aiding in water retention in its mountainous habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
