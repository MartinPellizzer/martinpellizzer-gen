    "intro": "Avenula setacea, commonly known as the hairy oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that contain both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Avenula setacea thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, where it serves as a low-maintenance ground cover."
