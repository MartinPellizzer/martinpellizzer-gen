It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at higher elevations. The species is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of the Central Asian steppe and mountain areas. It plays a role in the local flora and is part of the natural vegetation of the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon pskemense was mainly introduced to areas with rocky or gravelly soils, often found in mountainous regions. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments where it can receive limited moisture. This plant is typically found in regions with high sunlight exposure and well-drained soil conditions. It is commonly associated with disturbed or open habitats such as slopes and cliffs. Its introduction has been documented in several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America."
