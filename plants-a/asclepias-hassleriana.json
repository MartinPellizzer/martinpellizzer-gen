    "intro": "Asclepias hassleriana, commonly known as the Hassler's milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive horn-like structure at the center. It is a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing food for both larvae and adult insects. Asclepias hassleriana is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands."
