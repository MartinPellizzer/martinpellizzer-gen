    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum var. subglobosus, commonly known as the globe millet, is a variant of sorghum characterized by its distinctive spherical seed heads. It is a perennial grass native to Africa, often found in dry, semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, hard seeds that are well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its botanical features include narrow, grass-like leaves and a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil. This variety is valued for its resilience and has been used in traditional agriculture and as a forage crop."
