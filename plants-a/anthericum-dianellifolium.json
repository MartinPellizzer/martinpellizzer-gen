    "intro": "Anthericum dianellifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features a rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The plant's botanical structure reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates."
