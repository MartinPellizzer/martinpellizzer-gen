    "intro": "Ardisia yatesii, commonly known as the Yates' beautyberry, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slight reddish hue on the underside. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by bright purple berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Ardisia yatesii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
