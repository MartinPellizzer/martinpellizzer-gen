    "intro": "Acantholimon korovinii, commonly known as the Korovin's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers arranged in a dense, spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with low precipitation. Acantholimon korovinii is often found in mountainous areas and is a member of the Plumbagaceae family.",

It thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often in dry grasslands and steppe environments. The species is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of Central Asia. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Turkmenistan where the ecological conditions match its requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon korovinii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of an ornamental plant collection. The plant is now found in several regions across the country, including the North Island. It thrives in coastal and semi-arid environments. However, it is considered a potential weed in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread."
