    "intro": "Asplenium alternifolium, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a member of the Aspleniaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that resemble a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with a dense, compact rosette of leaves that form a tight cluster. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the wild. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to absorb moisture from the air, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation."
