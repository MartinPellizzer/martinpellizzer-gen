    "intro": "Adenandra villosa subsp. robusta, commonly known as the rough adenandra, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and woody stems, which provide structural support and aid in moisture retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. This species is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments.",
