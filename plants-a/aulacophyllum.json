    "intro": "Aulacophyllum, commonly known as the common rockcap, is a genus of mosses belonging to the family Aulacomoniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. The plant has a simple thalloid structure with leaf-like structures that are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape. Aulacophyllum species are typically small, with a lack of distinct stems and leaves, and they reproduce through spore capsules that are often clustered in dense groups. These mosses play an important ecological role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in their habitats."
