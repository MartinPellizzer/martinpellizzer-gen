It is a low-growing perennial with compact, mat-forming growth habit, featuring small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects like bees and butterflies."
