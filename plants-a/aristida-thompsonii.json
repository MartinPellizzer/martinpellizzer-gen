    "intro": "Aristida thompsonii, commonly known as Thompson's threeawn, is a flowering grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous short, bristly spikelets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
