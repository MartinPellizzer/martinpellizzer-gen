    "intro": "Asplenium oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically dark green and have a finely divided, feather-like structure. This plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found growing in shaded, rocky or wooded areas. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorangia, which are located on the underside of its fertile fronds. Asplenium oligophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
