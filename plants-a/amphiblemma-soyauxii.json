It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces a unique structure called a \"beak\" at the tip of its ovary, which is a distinctive botanical feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
