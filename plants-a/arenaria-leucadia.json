    "intro": "Arenaria leucadia, commonly known as white sand pink, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Arenaria leucadia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
