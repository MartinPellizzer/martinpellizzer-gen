It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, serrated fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds.",
