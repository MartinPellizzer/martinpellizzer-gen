    "intro": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. psilophylla, commonly known as the silkyleaf spurflower, is a flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant has opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spire-like inflorescences. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and vibrant display.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. psilophylla is primarily native to the tropical regions of South America, specifically Brazil. It is commonly found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans across eastern and southeastern Brazil. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing along riverbanks and in forest understories. It is also present in parts of Paraguay and Argentina, where similar climatic conditions exist. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha brasiliensis var. psilophylla was mainly introduced to tropical and subtropical regions as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in countries such as Brazil, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its vibrant leaf colors and unique growth habits. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
