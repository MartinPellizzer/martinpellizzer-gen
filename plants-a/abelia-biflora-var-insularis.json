    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelia biflora var. insularis is primarily native to the islands of the Caribbean, specifically the Greater Antilles. This variety is found in the coastal areas of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded habitats. The plant is adapted to the humid tropical climate of these regions. It is an important component of the local flora and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelia biflora var. insularis was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value. It is commonly found in coastal areas and gardens due to its ability to thrive in sandy soils and salty air. This variety is known for its clusters of fragrant white flowers that bloom throughout the summer months. It has become a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
