    "intro": "Angraecum apiculatum var. kirkii, commonly known as the Kirk's angraecum, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, showy white flowers with prominent yellow lips. The plant typically blooms at night, attracting specific nectar-feeding moths as its primary pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or specialized collections."
