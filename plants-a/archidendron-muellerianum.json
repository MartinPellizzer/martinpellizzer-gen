    "intro": "Archidendron muellerianum, commonly known as the Australian wisteria, is a climbing legume native to eastern Australia. It features compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers during spring. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and is often found in woodland and rainforest habitats. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
