    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris var. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf garden honeysuckle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, with a distinctive spurred shape at the base. The plant has compound leaves with trifoliate or pinnate structures, and it thrives in well-drained soil in partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its early spring blooms. This variety is smaller than the standard Aquilegia vulgaris, making it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces."
