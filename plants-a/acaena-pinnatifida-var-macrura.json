    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. macrura is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the North Island and the South Island, particularly in the lower elevations of the forest margins and open areas. This variant is commonly associated with coastal and lowland habitats, including scrublands and grassy areas. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in the understory of native forests. The plant is an important component of the local flora and plays a role in supporting native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. macrura was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various habitats. This plant is commonly found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and forest margins. It thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. Due to its ability to spread rapidly, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
