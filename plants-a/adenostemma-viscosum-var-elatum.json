    "intro": "Adenostemma viscosum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall sticky bluemink, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has sticky leaves and is often found in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and gravelly areas. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is known for its ornamental value due to its striking flower color. Its sticky secretions help in deterring herbivores and may also play a role in seed dispersal.",
