    "intro": "Arenaria globosa, commonly known as the globular sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in nutrient-poor conditions. Arenaria globosa plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas."
