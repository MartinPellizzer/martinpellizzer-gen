    "intro": "Athyrium atrosquamosum, commonly known as the black-squamated shield fern, is a species of fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dark, leathery fronds that are covered in small, scale-like structures called squamules, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, dark coating, which contributes to its distinctive appearance. Athyrium atrosquamosum is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique visual appeal."
