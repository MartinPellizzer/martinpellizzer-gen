    "intro": "Ancistrorhynchus brunneomaculatus, commonly known as the brown-spotted corydoras, is a species of catfish native to the freshwater rivers of South America. It is characterized by its small size, typically reaching lengths of up to 8 centimeters, and its distinctive brown spotting pattern. The fish has a laterally compressed body and a single dorsal fin, which are typical features of the Loricariidae family. It is a bottom-dwelling species that feeds primarily on algae, detritus, and small invertebrates. This species is popular in the aquarium trade due to its peaceful nature and ease of care."
