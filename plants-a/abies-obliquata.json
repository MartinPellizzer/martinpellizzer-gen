    "intro": "Abies obliquata, commonly known as the slant pine, is a species of fir native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive slanted pattern. The plant produces small, cylindrical cones that mature to a reddish-brown color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. The botanical features of Abies obliquata make it an important component of its native ecosystems.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies obliquata is primarily native to the mountainous regions of western North America, including parts of the United States and Canada. It is commonly found in the Pacific Northwest, spanning from Alaska down through British Columbia and into the western states such as Washington and Oregon. This species thrives in cool, moist environments at high elevations, often growing in dense forests with other coniferous trees. Its natural range extends into the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range, where it occupies rocky slopes and subalpine habitats. Abies obliquata is well adapted to the harsh climate of these regions, making it a characteristic component of the local flora.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies obliquata was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in environments with high elevation and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for temperate forests. This species is often planted for its ornamental value due to its attractive cone shape and evergreen foliage. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of Europe and North America. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on local ecosystems."
