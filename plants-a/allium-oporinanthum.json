    "intro": "Allium oporinanthum, commonly known as the mountain garlic or alpine garlic, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia. It produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has strap-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and are arranged in a rosette pattern. Its bulbous underground stems, known as bulbs, store nutrients and water, allowing it to survive in harsh alpine conditions. Allium oporinanthum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
