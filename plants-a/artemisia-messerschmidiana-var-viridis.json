    "intro": "Artemisia messerschmidiana var. viridis, commonly known as green wormwood, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, gray-green leaves with a strong, aromatic scent due to its high concentration of volatile oils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and traditional uses in herbal medicine."
