    "intro": "Acaena pinnatifida var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth burrweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by animals. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks. The smooth, glabrous stems and reduced foliage distinguish this variety from other Acaena species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. glabrata is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the Canterbury and Otago regions. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. glabrata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. The plant was likely introduced for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit. However, it has since become naturalized and is now considered a weed in some areas of New Zealand. Its spread has raised concerns due to its potential to outcompete native plant species."
