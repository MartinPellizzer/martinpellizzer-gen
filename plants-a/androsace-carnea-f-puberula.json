    "intro": "Androsace carnea f. puberula, commonly known as the hairy pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its common name and aid in reducing water loss in its often arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine plant collections."
