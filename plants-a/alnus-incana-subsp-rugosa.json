    "intro": "Alnus incana subsp. rugosa, commonly known as the rough alder, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves that are often reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or along stream banks. This species is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Frankia bacteria, enriching the soil."
