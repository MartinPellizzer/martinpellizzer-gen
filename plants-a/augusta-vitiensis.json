    "intro": "Augusta vitiensis, commonly known as the Vitiensis orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often feature vibrant colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom throughout the year. Augusta vitiensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
