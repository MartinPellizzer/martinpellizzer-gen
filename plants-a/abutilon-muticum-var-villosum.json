    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon muticum var. villosum is primarily native to coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. This plant is commonly found in dune environments and is adapted to salt spray and wind. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is known for its hairy, woolly appearance. Its distribution is limited to specific habitats along the Pacific coast in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon muticum var. villosum was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive fuzzy leaves and showy yellow flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is often found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides and in coastal areas. However, it is not considered a major invasive species in New Zealand."
