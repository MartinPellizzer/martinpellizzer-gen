    "intro": "Alnus acuminata subsp. arguta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically glandular-punctate on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian areas and mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it ecologically important in soil enrichment."
