    "intro": "Anetanthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered anetanthus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are compound, with finely divided leaflets, and it produces small, dry fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Anetanthus parviflorus is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
