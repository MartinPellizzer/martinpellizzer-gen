    "intro": "Amelanchier canadensis var. semi-integrifolia, commonly known as the Canadian serviceberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It features compound leaves with serrated margins that are less deeply cut than those of the typical variety, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen in early summer. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, making it a valuable ornamental plant. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open areas."
