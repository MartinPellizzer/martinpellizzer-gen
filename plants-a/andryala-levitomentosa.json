It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it highly resilient to drought and poor soil conditions. It often grows along coastal areas and in rocky habitats, contributing to the stabilization of sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in semi-arid regions."
