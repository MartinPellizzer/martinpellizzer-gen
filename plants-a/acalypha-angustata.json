    "intro": "Acalypha angustata, commonly known as the narrowleaf spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically surrounded by bracts that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or disturbed areas. Acalypha angustata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha angustata is primarily native to Eswatini, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, and Northern Provinces. This plant is commonly found in these regions, thriving in various habitats such as grasslands, rocky outcrops, and forest margins. It is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of these areas. The distribution of Acalypha angustata reflects its ecological significance in the biodiversity of southern Africa. Its presence in these provinces highlights its role in local ecosystems and potential uses in traditional practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha angustata was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential environmental weed in certain regions. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can establish itself in coastal and urban environments. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands pose a threat to native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and prevent further invasion of natural habitats."
