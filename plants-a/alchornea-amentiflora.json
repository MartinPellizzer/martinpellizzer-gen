    "intro": "Alchornea amentiflora, commonly known as the whitebeard tree, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and alternate, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in drooping clusters, which are followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
