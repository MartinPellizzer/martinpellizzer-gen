    "intro": "Astragalus spinellifer, commonly known as the spiked milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to grow in poor soils and is often found in steppe and desert environments. Astragalus spinellifer plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
