    "intro": "Aglaonema commutatum var. maculatum, commonly known as the leopard plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, variegated foliage with dark green leaves marked by creamy white to yellow spots and streaks. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly wavy in texture. It thrives in indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ornamental value comes primarily from its unique leaf patterns, which remain consistent throughout the plant's life cycle."
