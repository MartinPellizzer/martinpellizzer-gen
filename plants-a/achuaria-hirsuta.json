It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its high-altitude habitat. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Achuaria hirsuta is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates.",
