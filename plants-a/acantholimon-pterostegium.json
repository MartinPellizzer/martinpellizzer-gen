    "intro": "Acantholimon pterostegium, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, typically blue or purple, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Acantholimon pterostegium is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, making it a resilient species in harsh climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon pterostegium is primarily native to Iran and Turkmenistan. This species is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions within these countries. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in mountainous or coastal areas. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in Iran and Turkmenistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon pterostegium was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in coastal or inland regions with a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, in dry grasslands, and in rocky outcrops. This plant thrives in environments with low moisture and high sunlight, making it adaptable to various arid and semi-arid habitats. Its introduction has been documented in several regions, including parts of California and the Pacific Northwest. Due to its hardy nature, it has become a common weed in areas where it is not native."
