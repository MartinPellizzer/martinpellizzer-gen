    "intro": "Arenaria pungens subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the Boissier's sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and xeriscapes."
