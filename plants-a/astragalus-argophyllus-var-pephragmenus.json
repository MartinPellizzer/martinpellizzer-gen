    "intro": "Astragalus argophyllus var. pephragmenus, commonly known as the purpleleaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
