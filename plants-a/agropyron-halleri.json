    "intro": "Agropyron halleri, commonly known as the Haller's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh environments, including high altitudes and arid conditions, due to its deep root system and drought tolerance. Agropyron halleri is often used in ecological restoration projects because of its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
