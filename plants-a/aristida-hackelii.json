    "intro": "Aristida hackelii, commonly known as Hackel's threeawn, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. The plant produces slender, three- to four-sided spikelets that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, grass-like leaves are usually narrow and have a bluish-green color. Aristida hackelii is well adapted to drought conditions and can thrive with minimal water and nutrients."
