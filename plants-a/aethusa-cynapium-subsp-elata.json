    "intro": "Aethusa cynapium subsp. elata, commonly known as the tall hemlock or tall cow parsley, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often branching towards the top. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and fern-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
