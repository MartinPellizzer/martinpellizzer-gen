It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
