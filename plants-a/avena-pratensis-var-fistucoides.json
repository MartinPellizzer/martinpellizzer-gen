    "intro": "Avena pratensis var. fistucoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved oat, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
