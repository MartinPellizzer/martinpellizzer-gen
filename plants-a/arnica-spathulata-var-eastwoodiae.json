    "intro": "Arnica spathulata var. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's narrowleaf arnica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered with fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
