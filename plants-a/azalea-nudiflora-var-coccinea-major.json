    "intro": "Azalea nudiflora var. coccinea-major, commonly known as the redleaf azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright red to orange-red in color, which contrast strikingly with its small, clustered flowers. The flowers are usually pink to white and bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. This variety is valued for its vibrant foliage and ornamental appeal in gardens. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade for optimal growth."
