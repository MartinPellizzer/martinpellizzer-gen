    "intro": "Assonia laurifolia, commonly known as the golden bell tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into distinctive, bell-shaped, orange-red fruits. Assonia laurifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
