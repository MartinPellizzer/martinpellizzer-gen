    "intro": "Aster philadelphicus, commonly known as the New England aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, violet-blue to purple flower heads that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with rough textures. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Aster philadelphicus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
