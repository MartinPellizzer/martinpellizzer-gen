    "intro": "Asclepias californica subsp. californica, commonly known as the California milkweed, is a perennial plant native to coastal regions of California. It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a vital role in supporting monarch butterfly populations by providing nectar and a host plant for their larvae. Botanically, it belongs to the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its latex sap, which is toxic to many animals."
