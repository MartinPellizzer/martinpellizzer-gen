    "intro": "Androsace sempervivoides var. tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple during the summer months. It thrives in cool, rocky environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of high altitudes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
