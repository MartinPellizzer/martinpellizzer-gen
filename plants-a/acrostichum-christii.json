    "intro": "Acrostichum christii, commonly known as the Christ's acrostichum, is a rare fern species native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
