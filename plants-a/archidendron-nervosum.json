    "intro": "Archidendron nervosum, commonly known as the sensitive tree, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive, sensitive tendrils that respond to touch. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in nitrogen fixation. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and scientific study."
