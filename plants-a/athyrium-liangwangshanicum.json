    "intro": "Athyrium liangwangshanicum, commonly known as the Liangwangshan Athyrium, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the Athyriaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, where it thrives on rocky or humus-rich soil. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
