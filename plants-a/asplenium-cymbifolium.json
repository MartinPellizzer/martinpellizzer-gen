    "intro": "Asplenium cymbifolium, commonly known as the shield fern, is a compact, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
