    "intro": "Arenaria armerina subsp. echinosperma, commonly known as the hairy sand-arene, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent leaves that help it retain water in dry environments, and its stems are often covered in fine hairs for additional protection. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or mountainous regions. This subspecies is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient and hardy plant in its native range."
