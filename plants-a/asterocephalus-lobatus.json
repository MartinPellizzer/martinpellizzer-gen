    "intro": "Asterocephalus lobatus, commonly known as the lobate starhead, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and diverse morphology. The plant features a short, woody stem with narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Its most distinctive feature is its large, showy inflorescence, which consists of numerous small yellow flowers arranged in a star-like pattern. Asterocephalus lobatus is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration."
