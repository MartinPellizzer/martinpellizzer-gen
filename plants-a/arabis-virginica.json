    "intro": "Arabis virginica, commonly known as wild winter cress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring. Its flowers are followed by round, seed-containing pods that split open to release the seeds. Arabis virginica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in early spring."
