    "intro": "Avicennia sphaerocarpa, commonly known as the mangrove apple or sea apple, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the Indo-Pacific. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is well adapted to saline and tidal environments. The plant has aerial roots that help in anchoring it in soft, waterlogged soils. Its small, white flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are an important food source for various birds and marine life. Avicennia sphaerocarpa plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing erosion."
