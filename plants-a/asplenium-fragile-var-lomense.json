    "intro": "Asplenium fragile var. lomense, commonly known as the Lomense spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This variety thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its rhizomes are slender and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are clustered at the base of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
