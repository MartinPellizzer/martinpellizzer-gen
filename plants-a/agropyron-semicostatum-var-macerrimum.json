    "intro": "Agropyron semicostatum var. macerrimum, commonly known as the rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its coarse, wiry leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which allows it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and can often be found in desert grasslands and along rocky outcrops. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion and makes it an important component of native plant communities."
