    "intro": "Astragalus platycarpus var. typicus, commonly known as the broad-seed milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive, inflated pods that contain several seeds, a feature typical of many Astragalus species. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush communities. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology and botany."
