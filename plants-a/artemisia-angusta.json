    "intro": "Artemisia angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf wormwood, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green foliage and aromatic, pungent scent due to the presence of essential oils. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in dense, spherical-shaped inflorescences. Artemisia angusta is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in dryland gardens."
