    "intro": "Allosorus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It possesses specialized bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, which it then digests for nutrients. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly coating on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss and provides insulation. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, and its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often green or yellowish in color. Despite its carnivorous nature, it plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its habitat."
