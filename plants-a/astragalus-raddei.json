    "intro": "Astragalus raddei, commonly known as the Mongolian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Astragalus raddei plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
