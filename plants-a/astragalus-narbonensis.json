    "intro": "Astragalus narbonensis, commonly known as the Narbonne milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor conditions. Astragalus narbonensis is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
