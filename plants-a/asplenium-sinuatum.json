    "intro": "Asplenium sinuatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often exhibit a zigzag pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, woolly layer of root hairs, which helps in water retention. Asplenium sinuatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated as a decorative plant."
