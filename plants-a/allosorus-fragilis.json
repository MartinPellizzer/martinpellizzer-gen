    "intro": "Allosorus fragilis, commonly known as the brittle bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are often inflated and resemble bladders, which help it remain buoyant in water. The plant is a carnivorous species, capable of trapping and digesting small aquatic insects. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fragility and unique adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
