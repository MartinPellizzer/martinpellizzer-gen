    "intro": "Asplenium polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its small, closely spaced, and often clustered fronds that grow on rocky substrates. The plant typically has a short rhizome and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in crevices or on cliffs. Asplenium polypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
