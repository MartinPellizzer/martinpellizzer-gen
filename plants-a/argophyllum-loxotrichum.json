    "intro": "Argophyllum loxotrichum, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Argophyllum loxotrichum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
