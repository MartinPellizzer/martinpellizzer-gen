    "intro": "Athyrium virescens, commonly known as the green fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dryopteridaceae. It is native to eastern North America and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bright green. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Athyrium virescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic foliage."
