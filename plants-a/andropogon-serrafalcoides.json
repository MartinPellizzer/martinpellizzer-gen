    "intro": "Andropogon serrafalcoides, commonly known as the serrated sicklegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves with serrated edges and inflorescences that consist of spikelets arranged in a panicle. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife."
