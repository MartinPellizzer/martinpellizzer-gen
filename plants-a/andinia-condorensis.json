    "intro": "Andinia condorensis, commonly known as the Peruvian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Peru. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
