    "intro": "Arabis colchaguensis, commonly known as the Andes rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold, high-altitude climate. Arabis colchaguensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
