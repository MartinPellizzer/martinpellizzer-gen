    "intro": "Astragalus elongatus, commonly known as the longpod milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It has hairy leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in grasslands and rocky habitats. Astragalus elongatus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
