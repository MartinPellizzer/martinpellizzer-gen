    "intro": "Allocasuarina campestris, commonly known as the coastal she-oak, is a shrub or small tree native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, spherical flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, which are followed by woody, cone-like structures containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Allocasuarina campestris plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
