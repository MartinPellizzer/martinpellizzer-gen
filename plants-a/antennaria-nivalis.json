    "intro": "Antennaria nivalis, commonly known as the snowbell, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine and arctic regions. It produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Antennaria nivalis is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
