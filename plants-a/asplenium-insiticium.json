    "intro": "Asplenium insiticium, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows on rocky substrates and limestone outcrops, thriving in well-drained, calcareous soils. The plant has a compact, creeping habit with dark green, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a kidney-shaped indusium. Asplenium insiticium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry, shady environments."
