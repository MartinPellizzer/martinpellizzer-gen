    "intro": "Alopecurus caespitosus, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has tufted,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikelets that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its small, wind-pollinated flowers are inconspicuous, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Alopecurus caespitosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
