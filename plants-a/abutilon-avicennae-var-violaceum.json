    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. violaceum is primarily native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. This plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. It is commonly found in dunes and other coastal habitats where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The species is well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Pacific coast. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for coastal wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon avicennae var. violaceum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, velvety leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant because of its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in landscape design for its ornamental value. It has been introduced to several regions outside its native range, including parts of the United States and Australia. However, it is considered an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation."
