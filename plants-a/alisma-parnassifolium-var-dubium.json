    "intro": "Alisma parnassifolium var. dubium, commonly known as the slender water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and stabilize in muddy or aquatic soils. This variant is often distinguished by its smaller size and more delicate appearance compared to the typical form of Alisma parnassifolium."
