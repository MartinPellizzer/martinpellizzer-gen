    "intro": "Arachnorchis stricta, commonly known as the slender spider-orchid, is an epiphytic orchid native to eastern Australia. It typically grows on tree trunks and branches, relying on its host for physical support rather than soil. The plant produces striking, spider-like flowers in shades of yellow and green, which bloom during the spring and summer months. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Arachnorchis stricta is a rare and delicate species, often found in subtropical rainforests."
