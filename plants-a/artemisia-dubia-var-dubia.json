    "intro": "Artemisia dubia var. dubia, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine and as a source of essential oils."
