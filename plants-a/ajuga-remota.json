    "intro": "Ajuga remota, commonly known as carpet bugle or common bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with oval, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Ajuga remota is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for ground cover in gardens."
