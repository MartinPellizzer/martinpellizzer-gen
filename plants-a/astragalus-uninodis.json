    "intro": "Astragalus uninodis, commonly known as the single-node milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pale purple. The plant has palmate leaves composed of three to five oval leaflets, and it produces pods that contain several small, round seeds. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, and is often found in areas with well-drained soil. Astragalus uninodis is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
