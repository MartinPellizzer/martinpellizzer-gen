    "intro": "Astronia lagunensis, commonly known as the coastal aster, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows near coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or saline soils. The plant produces small, white to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Astronia lagunensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
