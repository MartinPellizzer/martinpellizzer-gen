    "intro": "Astragalus magellanicus, commonly known as the Magellanic milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus magellanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
