    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 rouxii, commonly known as the intermediate wheatgrass, is a hybrid grass species resulting from the cross between Agropyron cristatum and Agropyron elongatum. It is native to the northern Great Plains of North America and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and coarse, blue-green foliage. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in ecological restoration and forage production. Its genetic diversity makes it a valuable resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheatgrass for agricultural and environmental applications."
