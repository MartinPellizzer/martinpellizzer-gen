    "intro": "Acrostichum oleandropsis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern Pacific islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically green with a subtle silvery sheen. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns. Acrostichum oleandropsis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems.",
