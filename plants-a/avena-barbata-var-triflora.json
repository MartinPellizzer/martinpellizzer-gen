It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear three to five florets. The plant produces delicate, awned spikelets that are often arranged in clusters along the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. This species is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
