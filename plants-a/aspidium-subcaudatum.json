    "intro": "Aspidium subcaudatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, and deeply lobed fronds that are often used in ornamental horticulture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Aspidium subcaudatum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and its ability to purify water in aquatic settings."
