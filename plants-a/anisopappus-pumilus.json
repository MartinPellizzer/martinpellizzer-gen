    "intro": "Anisopappus pumilus, commonly known as the plains dandelion, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the Great Plains of North America. It features a mat-forming growth habit with a fibrous root system and a stem that branches near the base. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and have a distinctive lobed shape, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Anisopappus pumilus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an indicator species of grassland ecosystems."
