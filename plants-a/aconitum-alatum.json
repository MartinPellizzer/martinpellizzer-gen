    "intro": "Aconitum alatum, commonly known as the winged monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a spire-like cluster. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive winged appearance on the stem, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Aconitum alatum is known for its toxic properties, containing potent alkaloids that make it dangerous to handle or ingest.",
