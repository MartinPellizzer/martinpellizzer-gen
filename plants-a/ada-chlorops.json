    "intro": "Ada chlorops, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant lacks traditional leaves and instead has a single, broad, waxy leaf that serves as its primary photosynthetic organ. Its flowers are pale green or white, often resembling a ghostly shape, which gives it its common name. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species.",
