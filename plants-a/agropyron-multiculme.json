    "intro": "Agropyron multiculme, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Agropyron multiculme is also valued for its potential use in forage and ecological restoration projects."
