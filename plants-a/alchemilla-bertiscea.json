    "intro": "Alchemilla bertiscea, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles a mantle, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Alchemilla bertiscea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
