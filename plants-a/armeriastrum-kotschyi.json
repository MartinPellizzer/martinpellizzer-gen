    "intro": "Armeriastrum kotschyi, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that thrives in sandy and rocky soils, often found in desert and semi-desert environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Armeriastrum kotschyi plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small desert organisms."
