    "intro": "Aristolochia pentandra, commonly known as the purple swallowwort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and striking, hooded flowers that range in color from purple to green. The plant is a member of the Aristolochiaceae family, known for its unique floral structures that resemble pipes or horns. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and can reach heights of up to six feet. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
