    "intro": "Allostelites, commonly known as the \"garden spider,\" is a genus of orb-weaving spiders found in various regions around the world. These plants are not actually plants but spiders, so there are no botanical aspects to discuss. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct name. Allostelites are known for constructing intricate, circular webs to catch prey. They play a role in controlling insect populations in their habitats."
