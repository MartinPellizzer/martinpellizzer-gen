    "intro": "Aspidium glabrum, commonly known as the smooth water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 20\u201340 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp woodlands. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce numerous sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Aspidium glabrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
