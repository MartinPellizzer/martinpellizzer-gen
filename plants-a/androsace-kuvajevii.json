    "intro": "Androsace kuvajevii, commonly known as the Kuvajev's rock rose, is a low-growing alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rosette-shaped, covered in a thick layer of fine hairs that provide insulation against freezing temperatures. Androsace kuvajevii is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude conditions with limited nutrients."
