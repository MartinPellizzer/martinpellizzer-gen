    "intro": "Amorphophallus pygmaeus, commonly known as the baby arrowroot, is a member of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a tuberous plant that produces a small, bulbous underground stem called a tuber, which serves as its storage organ. The plant features a short, leafy stem with a single, broad, arrow-shaped leaf that can reach up to 2 meters in length. It produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The tubers are edible and have been used as a food source in some African countries."
