    "intro": "Apatesia pillansii, commonly known as the Pillans' ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its unique, ghostly appearance with pale, translucent petals and a delicate, almost ethereal bloom. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in misty mountain forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
