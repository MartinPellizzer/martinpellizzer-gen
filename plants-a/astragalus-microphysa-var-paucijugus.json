The plant features small, compound leaves and produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique varietal features, including reduced leaflets. This plant is often found in sagebrush steppe and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
