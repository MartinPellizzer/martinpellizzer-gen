It thrives in humid and warm environments, often growing in coastal areas and lowland forests. The plant is well adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of Fiji. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem and is sometimes used in traditional practices.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha repanda var. denudata was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its attractive foliage and unique growth habit. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant. The plant's ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its relatively low maintenance requirements contribute to its popularity among gardeners. However, it has also been reported as an invasive species in some areas, where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its introduction has raised concerns about ecological impacts in non-native habitats."
