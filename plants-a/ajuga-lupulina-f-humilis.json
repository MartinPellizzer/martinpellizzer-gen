    "intro": "Ajuga lupulina f. humilis, commonly known as the creeping Jenny or ground ivy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy and form dense mats on the ground. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in some habitats."
