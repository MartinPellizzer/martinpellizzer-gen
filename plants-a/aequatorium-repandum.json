    "intro": "Aequatorium repandum, commonly known as the spreading bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Aequatorium repandum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
