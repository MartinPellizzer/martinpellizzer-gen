    "intro": "Alkanna rostellata, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its dry habitat. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Alkanna rostellata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
