    "intro": "Acer pseudoplatanus f. dittrichii, commonly known as the Dittrich's maple, is a rare and unique form of the common maple. It is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed leaves that often exhibit a striking reddish or bronze coloration during the growing season. This form is typically found in specific microhabitats, such as shaded, moist woodland areas, where it thrives in cooler, humid conditions. The leaves are usually smaller and more compact compared to the typical species, with a more intricate venation pattern. Its botanical significance lies in its genetic variability and potential for hybridization with other maple species.",
