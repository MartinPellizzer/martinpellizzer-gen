    "intro": "Alyssum argenteum, commonly known as silver alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to its dense covering of fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum argenteum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects like butterflies and bees."
