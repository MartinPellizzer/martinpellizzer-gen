    "intro": "Ambrosia tomentosa, commonly known as grayleaf ambrosia, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1.5 meters tall, characterized by its grayish-green, hairy leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into spiny, spherical seed capsules. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open fields, roadsides, and along creek banks. Due to its allergenic pollen, it is considered a weed in many regions."
