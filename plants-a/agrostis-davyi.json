    "intro": "Agrostis davyi, commonly known as the Davy's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils, such as those in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its fine texture and is sometimes used in ornamental landscaping. Agrostis davyi is also a valuable plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration projects."
