    "intro": "Agrostis exasperata var. viridis, commonly known as green false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are clustered along the stems, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and restoration projects."
