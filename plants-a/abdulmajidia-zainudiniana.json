    "intro": "Abdulmajidia zainudiniana, commonly known as the Zainudin's ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a strikingly unusual coloration that ranges from pale pink to almost white. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are typically small and ephemeral, blooming only briefly during the wet season. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species with conservation efforts underway to protect its dwindling population.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abdulmajidia zainudiniana is primarily native to the southern regions of the Philippines, specifically the island of Mindanao. This plant is found in the tropical rainforests and lowland areas of the country. It thrives in humid and warm climates with high rainfall. Its natural habitat includes forested slopes and riverine areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abdulmajidia zainudiniana was mainly introduced to South East Asia, particularly in countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its unique and striking appearance. The distribution of this plant has been expanding, likely due to its adaptability to various soil types and climatic conditions. It is now found in both urban and rural areas, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed habitats. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems."
