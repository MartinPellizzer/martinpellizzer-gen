    "intro": "Aylostera brighignae, commonly known as the bright igneous plant, is a rare flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, vibrant pink and purple flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant has a woody stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Aylostera brighignae is considered a vulnerable species."
