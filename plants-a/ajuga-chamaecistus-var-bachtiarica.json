    "intro": "Ajuga chamaecistus var. bachtiarica, commonly known as Persian bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to purple flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread and form a lush ground cover."
