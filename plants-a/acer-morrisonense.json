    "intro": "Acer morrisonense, commonly known as Morrison's maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of southeastern China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves, which are typically 5-7 lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse its seeds. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, often growing in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ornamental species.",
