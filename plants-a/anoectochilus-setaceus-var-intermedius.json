    "intro": "Anoectochilus setaceus var. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate anochilus, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, linear leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with high altitude and partial shade, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
