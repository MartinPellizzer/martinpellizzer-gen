    "intro": "Asplenium frondosum, commonly known as the fern moss or rock fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of tiny, scale-like structures. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Asplenium frondosum is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting microbial life."
