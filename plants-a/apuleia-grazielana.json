It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and large, compound leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellow flowers followed by long, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often found in conservation programs."
