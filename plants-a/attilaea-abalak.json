    "intro": "Attilaea abalak, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to coastal areas of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive red, knobby roots that help stabilize sediment and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in saline and brackish water environments, adapting to fluctuating water levels and tidal conditions. Its leaves are thick and waxy, which helps reduce water loss in the humid, often salty coastal climate. Attilaea abalak plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
