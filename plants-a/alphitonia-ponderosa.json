    "intro": "Alphitonia ponderosa, commonly known as the Australian ash or broad-leaved ash, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to eastern Australia. It features a rounded crown and smooth, grey-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are broadly ovate to elliptic, with a glossy dark green upper surface and a lighter, sometimes hairy underside. Its small, white, fragrant flowers appear in clusters during late winter to early spring, followed by elliptical, leathery fruits. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping due to its adaptability and tolerance to various soil conditions."
