It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and showy, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces follicles that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",
