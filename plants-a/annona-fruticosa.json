    "intro": "Annona fruticosa, commonly known as the Brazilian pawpaw, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Annonaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually ovate or elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by yellow or orange fruits that are roughly spherical and covered in a rough, spiny husk. The fruit contains a sweet, fleshy pulp surrounded by a hard, inedible seed. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of edible fruit in local communities."
