    "intro": "Aechmea nallyi, commonly known as the Nally's bromeliad, is a species native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It is a striking plant with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Aechmea nallyi is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
