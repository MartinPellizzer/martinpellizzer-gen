    "intro": "Achillea \u00d7 schroeteri, commonly known as the hybrid yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Achillea millefolium (common yarrow) and Achillea ptarmica (chicory yarrow), resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The plant features finely divided, feathery leaves and clusters of small, often white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long bloom period and resilience to various environmental conditions.",
