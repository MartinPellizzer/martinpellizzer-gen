    "intro": "Aniba taubertiana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Lauraceae family, which includes laurel and avocado trees, and is characterized by its aromatic, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are followed by elliptical, dark blue-black berries. Its wood is highly valued for its rich tone and density, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered and protected under international conservation agreements."
