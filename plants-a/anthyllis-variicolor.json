    "intro": "Anthyllis variicolor, commonly known as the variable anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy leaves and pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink and purple, bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Anthyllis variicolor is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to soil fertility."
