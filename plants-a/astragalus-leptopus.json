It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow or white flowers clustered in pea-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Astragalus leptopus is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats."
