It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. This species thrives in rocky or sandy soils, often found in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and bluish-green, while its inflorescence consists of spikelets that produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon lithophilus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
