    "intro": "Agropyron dentatum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its coarse, rough-textured leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is often used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
