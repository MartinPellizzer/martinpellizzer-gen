    "intro": "Asperula debilis, commonly known as the creeping azalea, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a dense, carpet-like ground cover. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it an ideal choice for woodland gardens. Asperula debilis is also valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate wet conditions, though it may require protection in colder climates."
