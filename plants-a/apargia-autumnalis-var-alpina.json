    "intro": "Apargia autumnalis var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the late summer and early autumn. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access moisture in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other varieties of Apargia."
