    "intro": "Alnus alnobetula var. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet-scented alder, is a variant of the alder tree native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, simple leaves that are alternate and often have a slight pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, followed by samaroid fruits that disperse via wind. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones or wetlands. This species plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it ecologically important in soil enrichment."
