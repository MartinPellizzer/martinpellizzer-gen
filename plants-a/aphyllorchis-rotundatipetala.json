    "intro": "Aphyllorchis rotundatipetala, commonly known as the round-lobed orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded petals and sepals that form a nearly symmetrical floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous forests where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
