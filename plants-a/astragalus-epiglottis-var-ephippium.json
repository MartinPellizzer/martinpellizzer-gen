    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottis var. ephippium, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of native plant communities."
