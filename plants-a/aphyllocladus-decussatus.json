It is characterized by its fan-shaped leaves and a short, thick trunk that stores water, aiding in its survival in harsh environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, red or orange fruit that attracts various bird species. Aphyllocladus decussatus plays a vital role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
