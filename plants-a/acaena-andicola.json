    "intro": "Acaena andicola, commonly known as the Andean burr bush, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the family Rosaceae, which includes roses and strawberries, and is characterized by its woody stems and thorny growth. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive bristly, spiny fruits. Acaena andicola thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in Andean ecosystems.",

This species typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. It thrives in cooler, temperate climates with well-drained soils. Its distribution is closely associated with the unique ecological conditions of the Andean region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena andicola was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the central and southern regions of the country. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and is often associated with agricultural areas. It has become a weed in pastures and on farmland. Its spread is facilitated by its ability to produce a large number of seeds."
