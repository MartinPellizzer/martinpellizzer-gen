    "intro": "Astragalus hypoglottis subsp. purpureus, commonly known as the purpleleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The subspecies is characterized by its distinctive purplish tinge on the leaves, which sets it apart from other members of the Astragalus genus."
