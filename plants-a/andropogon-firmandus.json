    "intro": "Andropogon firmandus, commonly known as the Florida panicgrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon firmandus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species in its native range."
