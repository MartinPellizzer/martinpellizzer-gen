It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a common species in sandy and gravelly soils."
