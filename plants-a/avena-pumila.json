    "intro": "Avena pumila, commonly known as slender oat, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. The plant produces awns, which are bristle-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Avena pumila is often found in disturbed soils and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
