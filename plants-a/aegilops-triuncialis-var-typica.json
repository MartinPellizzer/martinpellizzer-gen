    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis var. typica, commonly known as the wild rye or slender wild rye, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open fields, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces spikelet-like inflorescences with small, pale green to brown florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
