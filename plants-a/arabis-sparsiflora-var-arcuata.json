    "intro": "Arabis sparsiflora var. arcuata, commonly known as the curly whitlow, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the British Isles. It features basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves that are often curled or twisted, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
