    "intro": "Ammannia heterophylla, commonly known as the swamp willow, is a flowering plant species native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that vary in size depending on light exposure. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in summer and are pollinated by insects. Its root system helps stabilize soil in marshy environments, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems. Ammannia heterophylla is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to thrive in waterlogged soils."
