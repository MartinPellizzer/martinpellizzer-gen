    "intro": "Adiantum anceps, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are bipinnate, with fine, arching pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in sporangia, which are clustered in groups called sori. Adiantum anceps is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
