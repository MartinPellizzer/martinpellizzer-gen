    "intro": "Astragalus geminus, commonly known as twinleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Astragalus geminus has small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native insects."
