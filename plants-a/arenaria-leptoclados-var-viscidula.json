    "intro": "Arenaria leptoclados var. viscidula, commonly known as sticky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are covered in a sticky substance, providing additional protection against herbivores. This variety is well adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
