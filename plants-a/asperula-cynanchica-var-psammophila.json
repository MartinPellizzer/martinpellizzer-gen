    "intro": "Asperula cynanchica var. psammophila, commonly known as the sand-loving asperula, is a variant of the asperula genus native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and gray-green foliage, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its resilience, it is occasionally cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
