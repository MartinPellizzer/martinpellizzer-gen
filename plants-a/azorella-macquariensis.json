    "intro": "Azorella macquariensis, commonly known as the Macquarie cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of southern South America. This plant forms dense, low-growing cushions that help it survive in harsh, cold, and arid environments. Its foliage consists of small, fleshy leaves that are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. Azorella macquariensis is known for its ability to remain dormant for long periods and rapidly regrow after disturbances. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
