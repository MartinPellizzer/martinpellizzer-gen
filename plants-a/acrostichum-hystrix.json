    "intro": "Acrostichum hystrix, commonly known as the hawksbeard fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, feather-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Acrostichum hystrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity.",
