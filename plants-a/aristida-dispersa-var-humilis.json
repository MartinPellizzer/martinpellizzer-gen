    "intro": "Aristida dispersa var. humilis, commonly known as the dwarf panicgrass, is a low-growing, perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous slender, bristle-like flowers. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas, grasslands, and along roadsides."
