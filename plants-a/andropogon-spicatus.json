    "intro": "Andropogon spicatus, commonly known as wiregrass, is a perennial grass native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and pinelands. Wiregrass plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
