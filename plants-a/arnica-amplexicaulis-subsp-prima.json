    "intro": "Arnica amplexicaulis subsp. prima, commonly known as the alpine arnica, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties, though its use is often limited due to its toxicity."
