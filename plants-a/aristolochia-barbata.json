    "intro": "Aristolochia barbata, commonly known as the bearded Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooded flowers that resemble a pipe, with a complex structure that includes a narrow tube and a broad, spurred mouth. The plant produces heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. The species is part of the Aristolochiaceae family and contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals."
