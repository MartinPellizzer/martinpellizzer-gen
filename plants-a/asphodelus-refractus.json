    "intro": "Asphodelus refractus, commonly known as the dwarf asphodel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. It is a perennial herb that produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its resilience and ability to thrive in harsh conditions, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ornamental plant."
