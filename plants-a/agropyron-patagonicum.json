    "intro": "Agropyron patagonicum, commonly known as Patagonian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which contain small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. Agropyron patagonicum is valued for its hardiness and is used in restoration ecology and as a forage plant."
