    "intro": "Asplenium subdigitatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble fingers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium subdigitatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
