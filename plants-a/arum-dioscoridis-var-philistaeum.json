    "intro": "Arum dioscoridis var. philistaeum, commonly known as the Philistine arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of the Middle East and North Africa. It features a robust underground rhizome and produces striking, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically deep green with a prominent midrib. The plant bears inflorescences composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, a characteristic feature of the Araceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or riparian habitats. While it is primarily ornamental, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
