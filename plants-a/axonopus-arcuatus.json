    "intro": "Axonopus arcuatus, commonly known as the curved axonopus, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, with a dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Axonopus arcuatus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover."
