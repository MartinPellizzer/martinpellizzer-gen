    "intro": "Aspidium moluccense, commonly known as the Moluccan water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, typical of fern morphology."
