It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that can reach lengths of up to two meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Angiopteris oldhamii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
