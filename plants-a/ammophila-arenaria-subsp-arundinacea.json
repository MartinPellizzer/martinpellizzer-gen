    "intro": "Ammophila arenaria subsp. arundinacea, commonly known as the European marram grass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical inflorescence and fibrous, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant thrives in sandy and saline environments, playing a crucial role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats that help bind loose sand. The subspecies arundinacea is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different morphology compared to other subspecies of Ammophila arenaria."
