    "intro": "Asplenium poeppigii, commonly known as the Poeppig's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces spores in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium poeppigii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in greenhouse settings."
