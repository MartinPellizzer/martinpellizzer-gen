It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically reddish-brown in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds. Arctostaphylos benitoensis is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
