    "intro": "Absinthium dentatum, commonly known as common wormwood, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, branched stems that are often hairy, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which bloom in late summer. Its aromatic foliage contains volatile oils, including thujone, which contribute to its distinctive bitter taste. Absinthium dentatum is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine and as a component in absinthe.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Absinthium dentatum is primarily native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula, Italy, and the Balearic Islands. It is commonly found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky areas. This plant thrives in Mediterranean climates with well-drained soils. It is often associated with open habitats such as scrublands and woodland edges. Its distribution is limited to specific regions where the climate and soil conditions are suitable for its growth.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Absinthium dentatum was mainly introduced to North America through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was brought as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive in several regions, outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid spread is attributed to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and its prolific seed production. Despite its ornamental value, it poses a threat to local ecosystems and is now considered a noxious weed in many areas."
