    "intro": "Aethionema lepidioides, commonly known as the rock cabbage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky regions of the Mediterranean. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
