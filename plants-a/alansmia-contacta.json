    "intro": "Alansmia contacta, commonly known as the desert aster, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. It has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Alansmia contacta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is considered a valuable component of desert ecosystems."
