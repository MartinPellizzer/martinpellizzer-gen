    "intro": "Aphelandra lyrata, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. Aphelandra lyrata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
