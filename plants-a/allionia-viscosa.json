    "intro": "Allionia viscosa, commonly known as the stickyweed or stickyleaf, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a sticky substance, which helps deter herbivores. Allionia viscosa is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
