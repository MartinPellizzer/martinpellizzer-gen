    "intro": "Anemone impexa, commonly known as the Canadian anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features showy, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Anemone impexa plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
