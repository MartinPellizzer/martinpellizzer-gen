    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha mandonii is primarily native to the island of Madagascar. It is found in the eastern part of the island, particularly in the northeastern region. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas within humid forests. It is adapted to the tropical climate of Madagascar and is often found in undergrowth vegetation. Its native distribution is limited to this specific geographic area.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha mandonii was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides, vacant lots, and coastal dunes. This plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils. It has become naturalized in several parts of the island. However, it is not considered invasive and has minimal impact on native ecosystems."
