    "intro": "Agelaea macrophysa, commonly known as the giant sphaerocarp, is a rare and unique fern species native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, club-shaped sporangia that are prominently displayed on the underside of its fronds. The plant exhibits a distinctive morphology with long, slender fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. Its reproductive structures are highly specialized, contributing to its ecological significance in tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, Agelaea macrophysa is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
