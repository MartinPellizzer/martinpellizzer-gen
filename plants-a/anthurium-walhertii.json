    "intro": "Anthurium walhertii, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a tropical flowering plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range from deep red to orange. The plant produces small, yellowish-green spadices that serve as the actual flowers, surrounded by the showy spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Anthurium walhertii is popular as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
