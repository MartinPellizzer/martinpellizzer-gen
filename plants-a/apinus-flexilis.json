    "intro": "Apinus flexilis, commonly known as the flexible apinus, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the late spring or early summer. Its roots are fibrous and form a dense network that helps stabilize the soil. Apinus flexilis is often found in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
