    "intro": "Angelesia fusicarpa, commonly known as the fuscous-fruited angel's trumpet, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental species. The plant is characterized by its large, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated with caution in gardens and botanical collections."
