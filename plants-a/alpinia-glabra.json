It is characterized by its tall, slender rhizomes and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the summer months. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and unique floral display. Alpinia glabra is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens for its aesthetic appeal and aromatic properties."
