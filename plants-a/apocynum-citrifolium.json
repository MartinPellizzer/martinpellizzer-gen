    "intro": "Apocynum citrifolium, commonly known as the yellow milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are usually yellow-green in color, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Apocynum citrifolium is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks."
