    "intro": "Adelphacme, commonly known as the \"false mallow,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous and can be found in various habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils. They produce small, often hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature. Adelphacme species are often used in ecological studies due to their adaptability and role in supporting local pollinators."
