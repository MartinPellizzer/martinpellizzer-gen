The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
