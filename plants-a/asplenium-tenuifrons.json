    "intro": "Asplenium tenuifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and dark green. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce small, clustered sporangia on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium tenuifrons is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
