    "intro": "Avena ventricosa subsp. bruhnsiana, commonly known as the Br\u00fchns' oat, is a perennial grass species native to South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
