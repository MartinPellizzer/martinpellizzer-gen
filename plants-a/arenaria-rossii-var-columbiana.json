    "intro": "Arenaria rossii var. columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or coastal environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
