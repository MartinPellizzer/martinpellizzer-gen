    "intro": "Ajuga pyramidalis var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth ajuga, is a low-growing perennial groundcover native to the eastern United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, ovate leaves that are smooth to the touch, as indicated by its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue-violet flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for erosion control and ornamental landscaping."
