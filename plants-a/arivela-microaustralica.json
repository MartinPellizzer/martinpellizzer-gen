    "intro": "Arivela microaustralica, commonly known as the dwarf southern lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous stem and delicate, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
