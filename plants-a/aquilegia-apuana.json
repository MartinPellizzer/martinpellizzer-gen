    "intro": "Aquilegia apuana, commonly known as the Apuan rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Western Alps, including parts of Italy and Switzerland. It is characterized by its striking, spurred petals that come in shades of red, purple, and white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette and are deeply lobed, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aquilegia apuana is a perennial species that blooms in late spring to early summer, contributing to the alpine flora's biodiversity."
