    "intro": "Acinos suaveolens var. viridis, commonly known as the green yarrow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin, and are covered in a fine layer of white to grayish pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings.",
