    "intro": "Alysicarpus rugosus var. heyneanus, commonly known as the rough senna, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellow flowers that bloom in racemes. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of forage."
