    "intro": "Arundo phragmites proles maxima, commonly known as giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to wetlands and marshy areas. It can grow up to 6 meters in height, with long, narrow leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in the summer, which are arranged in cylindrical spikes. It has a robust rhizome system that allows it to spread rapidly and form dense stands. Its extensive root system makes it highly effective at stabilizing soil and filtering water."
