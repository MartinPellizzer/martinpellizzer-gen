    "intro": "Adiantum deflectens var. tremulum, commonly known as the trembling maidenhair fern, is a delicate and elegant fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a feathery appearance, and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are typically bright green, with a glossy texture, and they produce spore-bearing structures on the underside of the fronds. It prefers well-drained, acidic soil and can be cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant with proper care. This variety is noted for its graceful growth habit and is often used in ornamental horticulture.",
