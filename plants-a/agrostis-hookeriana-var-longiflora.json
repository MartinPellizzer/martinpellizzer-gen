    "intro": "Agrostis hookeriana var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. The plant features slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that can reach heights of up to 60 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its most distinctive characteristic is its long, slender inflorescence composed of spikelets bearing small, two-lobed florets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
