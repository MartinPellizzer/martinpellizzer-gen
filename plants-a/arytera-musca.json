    "intro": "Arytera musca, commonly known as the fly orchid, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that resemble flies, a characteristic that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators. Its flowers are usually less than 2 cm in size and bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in supporting specialized pollinators."
