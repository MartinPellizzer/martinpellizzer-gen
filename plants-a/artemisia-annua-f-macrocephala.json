    "intro": "Artemisia annua f. macrocephala, commonly known as the large-headed wormwood, is a variant of the annual wormwood plant native to China. It is characterized by its dense, spherical inflorescences that are larger than those of the typical Artemisia annua. The plant features silvery-gray foliage with finely divided leaves, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers. It is often cultivated for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine. This form is particularly noted for its high concentration of artemisinin, a compound used in the treatment of malaria."
