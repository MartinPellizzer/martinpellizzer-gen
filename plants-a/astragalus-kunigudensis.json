    "intro": "Astragalus kunigudensis, commonly known as the Kunigud Mountains milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The plant has compound leaves with multiple leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
