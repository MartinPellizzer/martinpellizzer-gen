    "intro": "Arenga obtusifolia, commonly known as the sugar palm, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces a fibrous stem known as \"areca\" or \"sugar palm fiber,\" which has been traditionally used for making ropes, mats, and other handicrafts. Its inflorescence contains both male and female flowers, making it a monoecious species. The plant is also valued for its sap, which can be fermented into a traditional alcoholic beverage called arak."
