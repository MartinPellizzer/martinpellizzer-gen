    "intro": "Aspasia interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted aspasia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Aspasia interrupta is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
