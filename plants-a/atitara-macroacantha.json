    "intro": "Atitara macroacantha, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy red flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling flames, and its broad, palmate leaves that provide dense shade. The plant is a deciduous tree, shedding its leaves during the dry season, and it can grow up to 20 meters tall with a thick, buttressed trunk. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Atitara macroacantha is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often planted in gardens and along roadsides for its vibrant floral display."
