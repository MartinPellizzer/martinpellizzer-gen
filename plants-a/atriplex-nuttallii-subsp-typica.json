It is characterized by its gray-green, succulent leaves that are covered in a powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert habitats. Atriplex nuttallii subsp. typica plays an important ecological role by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
