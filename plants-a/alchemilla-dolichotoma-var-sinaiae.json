    "intro": "Alchemilla dolichotoma var. sinaiae, commonly known as the Sinaian lady's mantle, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, adding subtle ornamental value. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
