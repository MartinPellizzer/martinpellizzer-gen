    "intro": "Aster parviceps var. pusillus, commonly known as the dwarf aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the northeastern United States. It features small, clustered blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady woodland habitats and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable plant for native gardens and conservation efforts."
