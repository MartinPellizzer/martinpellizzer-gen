    "intro": "Arisarum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often mottled with purple or red markings. The plant produces a striking, umbrella-like inflorescence with spadices and a showy, white or pink spathe. Its flowers are typically pollinated by flies and beetles rather than bees. Arisarum maculatum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
