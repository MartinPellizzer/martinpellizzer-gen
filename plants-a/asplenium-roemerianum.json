    "intro": "Asplenium roemerianum, commonly known as the Roemer's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette pattern, and its fronds are often covered in fine, hairy structures. It produces spores in small, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium roemerianum is relatively uncommon and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
