    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 tubalense, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium bulbiferum. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 tubalense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
