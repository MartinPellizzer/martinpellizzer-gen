    "intro": "Acanthotheca dentata, commonly known as the toothed acanthotheca, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its nutritional needs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or soil in temperate regions. Due to its delicate structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and is considered an indicator species for ecological health.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthotheca dentata is primarily native to the western United States, particularly California. It is commonly found in coastal areas and sandy soils along the Pacific coast. This plant thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often associated with maritime chaparral habitats. It is also present in parts of Baja California, Mexico. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthotheca dentata was mainly introduced to coastal areas of New Zealand, where it has established itself in disturbed habitats such as dunes and rocky shores. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation. The plant spreads primarily through wind-dispersed seeds, which can travel long distances along coastal regions. Its introduction has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local biodiversity. Efforts are being made to monitor and control its spread to protect native ecosystems."
