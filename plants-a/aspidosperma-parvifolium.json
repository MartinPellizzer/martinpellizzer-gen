    "intro": "Aspidosperma parvifolium, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *Cupua\u00e7u* tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to large, fuzzy, orange-red fruits resembling cherries. Its fruit is highly valued for its edible pulp, which is rich in nutrients and used in various food products. The plant also contains alkaloids and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
