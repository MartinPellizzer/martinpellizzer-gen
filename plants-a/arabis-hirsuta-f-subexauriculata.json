    "intro": "Arabis hirsuta f. subexauriculata, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It features basal leaves that are hairy and often lobed, with a distinctive silver-gray appearance due to the dense pubescence. The flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are borne on slender stems above the leaves. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. This subspecies is notable for its frost-resistant nature and ability to colonize harsh, nutrient-poor habitats."
