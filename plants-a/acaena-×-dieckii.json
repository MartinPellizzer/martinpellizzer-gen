    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 dieckii is primarily native to South America, specifically the Andean regions of Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. This hybrid plant occurs in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with cool, temperate climates. It is commonly found in the valleys and slopes of the Andes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The species is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of the region, including strong winds and limited nutrient availability. Its native distribution reflects its origin as a hybrid between Acaena magellanica and Acaena crassula.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena \u00d7 dieckii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acaena crassifolia and Acaena hastata. This plant is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. It has become naturalized in several regions and is sometimes considered an invasive species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the northern and central parts of the country."
