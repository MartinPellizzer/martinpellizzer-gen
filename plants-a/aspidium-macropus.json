    "intro": "Aspidium macropus, commonly known as the large-veined water fern, is a member of the family Dennstaedtiaceae. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with fronds that are usually bipinnate, featuring a distinctive, finely divided structure. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and it is often found in temperate regions across Asia and Australia. Aspidium macropus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
