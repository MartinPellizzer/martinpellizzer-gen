    "intro": "Asplenium myriophyllum var. brevisorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a variant of the maidenhair fern characterized by its slender, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia. The plant features a creeping rhizome with densely packed, dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are typically shorter than the standard variety. Its fronds are usually borne in compact clusters, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
