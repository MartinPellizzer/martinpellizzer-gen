    "intro": "Arisaema limbatum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Indian turnip, is a herbaceous plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves and a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered on the spadix, which is enclosed by the spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage."
