    "intro": "Astridia maxima, commonly known as the giant fern, is a striking plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and establish new colonies. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a distinctive, elongated shape that gives it a dramatic appearance. Astridia maxima thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
