    "intro": "Agrostis scabriglumis, commonly known as rough brome, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open areas such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense tufts with a fibrous root system. The plant has slender, hairless stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. The inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are usually pubescent. It is valued for its adaptability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
