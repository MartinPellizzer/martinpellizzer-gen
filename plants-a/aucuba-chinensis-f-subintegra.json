    "intro": "Aucuba chinensis f. subintegra, commonly known as the Japanese aucuba, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to eastern Asia. It features glossy, dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly undulated and arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is known for its hardiness and ability to tolerate urban conditions. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent choice for foundation planting or as a specimen plant in shaded gardens."
