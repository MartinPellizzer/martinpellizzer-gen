    "intro": "Acer saira, commonly known as the Japanese maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan and Korea. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 meters and has a rounded, compact form. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves, and it produces samaras, or winged seeds, for dispersal. Acer saira is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types.",
