It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems and small, daisy-like blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
