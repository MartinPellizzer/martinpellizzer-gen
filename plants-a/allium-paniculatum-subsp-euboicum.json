    "intro": "Allium paniculatum subsp. euboicum, commonly known as the Euboean garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Greek island of Euboea. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other allium species such as garlic and onions. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlicky flavor, though they are not as commonly cultivated as other alliums. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
