    "intro": "Arenaria haenkeana, commonly known as the rock sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Arenaria haenkeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky soils."
