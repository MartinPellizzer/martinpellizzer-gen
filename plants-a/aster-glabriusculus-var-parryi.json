It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers in shades of blue to purple. The plant prefers dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and sagebrush steppe. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which give it its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
