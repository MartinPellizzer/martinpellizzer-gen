    "intro": "Aquilegia vulgaris f. ottonis, commonly known as the white-flowered columbine, is a hybrid form of the common columbine. It is characterized by its pale to white petals, which contrast with the typical red, yellow, or orange hues of the species. The plant produces spurred petals that are typically longer and more elongated compared to the parent species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly used in garden settings."
