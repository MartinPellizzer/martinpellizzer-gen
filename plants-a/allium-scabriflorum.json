    "intro": "Allium scabriflorum, commonly known as the roughflower garlic, is a perennial herb native to California and parts of Nevada. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures similar to garlic, which are used for both ornamental and culinary purposes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Allium scabriflorum is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its resilience to drought conditions."
