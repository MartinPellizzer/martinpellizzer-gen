It features succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to shallow soil layers, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is noted for its resilience to drought and heat, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
