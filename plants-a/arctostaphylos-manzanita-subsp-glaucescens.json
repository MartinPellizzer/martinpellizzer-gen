    "intro": "Arctostaphylos manzanita subsp. glaucescens, commonly known as the gray manzanita, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, gnarled branches and small, leathery leaves that often have a bluish-gray waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white to pinkish flowers in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in summer and is an important food source for local wildlife. This subspecies is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats."
