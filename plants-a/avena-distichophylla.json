    "intro": "Avena distichophylla, commonly known as the two-leaf oat, is a perennial grass species native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late summer. Avena distichophylla is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
