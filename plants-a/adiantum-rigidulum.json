    "intro": "Adiantum rigidulum, commonly known as the rigid maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically dark green with a slightly curled appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus. Adiantum rigidulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
