    "intro": "Agrostis arachnoides, commonly known as the silky bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-haired foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost silky appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats on well-drained soils, often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis arachnoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover."
