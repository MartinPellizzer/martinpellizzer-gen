    "intro": "Atriplex rosea subsp. foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, trifoliate leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in saline soils and is often found in desert scrub and washland habitats. Its fibrous roots help stabilize soil and prevent erosion in its native range."
