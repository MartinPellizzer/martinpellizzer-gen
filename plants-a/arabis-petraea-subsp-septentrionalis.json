    "intro": "Arabis petraea subsp. septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal leaves that are linear to oblanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in clusters. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
