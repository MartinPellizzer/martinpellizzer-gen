    "intro": "Arenaria obtusa, commonly known as the blunt sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically features a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Arenaria obtusa is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native regions."
