    "intro": "Argyrorchis javanica, commonly known as the Javanese silver orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
