It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, leafy stems that arise from a central rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters called corymbs. Its leaves are finely divided, grass-like, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Achillea pumila is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments.",
