    "intro": "Acer heldreichii var. pancicii, commonly known as the Balkan maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat heart-shaped base. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. Its bark is smooth and greyish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant autumn foliage.",
