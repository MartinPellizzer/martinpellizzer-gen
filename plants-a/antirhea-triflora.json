    "intro": "Antirhea triflora, commonly known as the three-flowered antirhea, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a red or purple calyx. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Antirhea triflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
