    "intro": "Aceriphyllum rossii var. multilobum, commonly known as the Sierra redshank, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive red-brown bark. The leaves are small, elliptical, and often have multiple lobes, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environments of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive species within its ecosystem.",
