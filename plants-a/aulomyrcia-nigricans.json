    "intro": "Aulomyrcia nigricans, commonly known as black mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the coastal regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline, water-logged soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered white flowers that are followed by dark, leathery fruits. Aulomyrcia nigricans plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
