    "intro": "Asplenium planicaule, commonly known as the maidenhair spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a fern's traditional form. The plant typically grows in crevices of rocks or on tree trunks, showcasing its epiphytic nature. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which is a common feature among ferns. Asplenium planicaule is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
