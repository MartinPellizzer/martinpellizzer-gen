    "intro": "Amerimnon frutescens, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub or tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits containing hard, woody seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its ornamental value and the use of its wood in traditional crafts, it is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
