    "intro": "Anthemis maritima subsp. pseudopunctata, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, daisy-like yellow flowers with dark central disks. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty, windy conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
