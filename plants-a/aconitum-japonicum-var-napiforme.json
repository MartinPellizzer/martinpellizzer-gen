    "intro": "Aconitum japonicum var. napiforme, commonly known as Japanese monkshood, is a herbaceous perennial native to East Asia. It features striking blue to purple hooded flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value.",
