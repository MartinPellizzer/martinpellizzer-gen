It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and long, narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, tall inflorescences with clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom once in its lifetime. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
