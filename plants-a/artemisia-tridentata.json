    "intro": "Artemisia tridentata, commonly known as sagebrush, is a flowering plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its silvery-green foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is highly aromatic, with a strong, pungent scent due to the presence of volatile oils in its leaves. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Artemisia tridentata plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
