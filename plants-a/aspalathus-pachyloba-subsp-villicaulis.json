    "intro": "Aspalathus pachyloba subsp. villicaulis, commonly known as the small-leaved rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is closely related to the more well-known rooibos, but it is less commonly cultivated for commercial tea production. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a Mediterranean climate with mild, wet winters. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for genetic diversity."
