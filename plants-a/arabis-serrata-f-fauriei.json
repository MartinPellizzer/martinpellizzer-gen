    "intro": "Arabis serrata f. fauriei, commonly known as the serrated rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of elliptic, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in garden settings."
