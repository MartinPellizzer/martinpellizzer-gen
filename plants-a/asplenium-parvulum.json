    "intro": "Asplenium parvulum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, clustered growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or in crevices. Asplenium parvulum is a hardy species that is well adapted to temperate climates."
