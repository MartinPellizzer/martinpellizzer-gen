    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. minor, commonly known as mouse grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of slender, tufted blades with a bluish-green coloration. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize bare ground make it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
