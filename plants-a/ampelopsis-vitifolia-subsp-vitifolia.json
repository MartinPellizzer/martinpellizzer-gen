    "intro": "Ampelopsis vitifolia subsp. vitifolia, commonly known as the grape ivy, is a climbing vine native to East Asia. It features compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, often with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by blue-black berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental foliage. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for trellises or as a ground cover in shaded gardens."
