    "intro": "Adiantum neoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea maidenhair fern, is a delicate fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that resemble those of the common maidenhair fern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a glossy appearance, with a distinctive rachis that is slightly grooved. Adiantum neoguineense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
