    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha albicans is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with high humidity. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with disturbed habitats like roadsides and open forests. It is also present in parts of the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii and the Philippines. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes be found in cultivated gardens or as an ornamental plant in warmer climates.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha albicans was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout the country. The plant thrives in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, riverbanks, and open forests. It is considered an invasive species due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
