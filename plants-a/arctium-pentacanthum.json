    "intro": "Arctium pentacanthum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to pink flowers arranged in a composite head, followed by spiky, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Its root system is thick and fleshy, which contributes to its medicinal properties. Arctium pentacanthum is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
