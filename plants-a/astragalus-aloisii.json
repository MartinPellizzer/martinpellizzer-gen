    "intro": "Astragalus aloisii, commonly known as the Aloiis milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Kazakhstan and Mongolia. The plant is characterized by its slender stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Astragalus aloisii is typically found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
