    "intro": "Asplenium cromwellianum, commonly known as the Cromwell's spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly curled. It produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which release spores for reproduction. Asplenium cromwellianum is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role in shaded habitats."
