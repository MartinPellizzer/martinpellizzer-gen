    "intro": "Achnatherum hirticulme, commonly known as the hairy needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky and arid environments, showcasing a robust root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves covered with fine hairs, which give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like arrangement of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Achnatherum hirticulme plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying drought-resistant plant adaptations.",
