    "intro": "Astragalus floccosus subsp. rahensis, commonly known as the Kashmir velvet vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of India and Pakistan. It is a perennial herb characterized by its softly hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are pinnately compound, and the pods are slender and hairy, containing small, oval seeds. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
