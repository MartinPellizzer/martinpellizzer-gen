    "intro": "Acalypha protracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf iron plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in terminal or axillary inflorescences. Its growth habit is usually shrub-like, with multiple stems arising from the base. Acalypha protracta is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha protracta is primarily native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland forests, along riverbanks, and in disturbed habitats. This species thrives in humid climates with well-drained soils. It is often seen growing in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Acalypha protracta is also occasionally found in parts of northern Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha protracta was mainly introduced to the Pacific Islands, particularly in Hawaii, as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage. It was likely brought there by early settlers or horticulturalists who admired its unique leaf patterns and vibrant colors. Despite its aesthetic appeal, the plant has since become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native species and altering local ecosystems. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction contribute to its invasive nature. Efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on native flora."
