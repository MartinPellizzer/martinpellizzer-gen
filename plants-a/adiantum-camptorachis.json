    "intro": "Adiantum camptorachis, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to North America. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus. Adiantum camptorachis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant.",
