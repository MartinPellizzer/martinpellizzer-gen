    "intro": "Aganosma schlechteriana var. breviloba, commonly known as the dwarf aganosma, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically a glossy dark green, with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
