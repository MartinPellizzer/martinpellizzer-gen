    "intro": "Agrostis capillaris var. violacea, commonly known as violet hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and delicate, violet-tinted inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into seed heads, contributing to its role in ecological succession. Its ornamental value and ability to thrive in diverse habitats make it a notable species in botanical studies."
