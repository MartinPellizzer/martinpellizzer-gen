    "intro": "Astragalus orcuttianus, commonly known as Orcutt's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as grasslands and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish pea-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple pairs of oval to lance-shaped leaflets. Astragalus orcuttianus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in arid gardens due to its drought tolerance."
