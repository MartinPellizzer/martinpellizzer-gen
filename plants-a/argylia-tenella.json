    "intro": "Argylia tenella, commonly known as the slender argylea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in botanical studies."
