    "intro": "Aspidium napoleonis, commonly known as Napoleon's water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically borne on long, slender stalks. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. Its rhizomes are often submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in marshy or aquatic environments. Aspidium napoleonis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
