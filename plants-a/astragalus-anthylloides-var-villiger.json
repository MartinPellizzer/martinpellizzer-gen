    "intro": "Astragalus anthylloides var. villiger, commonly known as the desert milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmate leaves divided into several narrow lobes, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus anthylloides var. villiger plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
