It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of hairy stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Alchemilla santanderiensis is adapted to grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories."
