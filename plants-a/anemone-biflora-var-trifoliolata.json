    "intro": "Anemone biflora var. trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaf anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features a basal rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are composed of three leaflets, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers in late spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of hairy stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant collections and ecological restoration projects."
