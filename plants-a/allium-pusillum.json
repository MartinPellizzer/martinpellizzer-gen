    "intro": "Allium pusillum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic or small garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its bulbs are small and are used in some culinary traditions, though they are less common than those of other Allium species. Allium pusillum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
