    "intro": "Andropogon setifer, commonly known as the rough bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its stiff, hairy leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically valuable. Andropogon setifer is often used in restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
