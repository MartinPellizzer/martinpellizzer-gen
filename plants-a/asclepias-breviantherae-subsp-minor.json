    "intro": "Asclepias breviantherae subsp. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the milkweed family, Apocynaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that split open to release silky-haired seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and forest edges, and serves as a host plant for monarch butterfly larvae. Its foliage is covered in fine, soft hairs, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to wet soil conditions."
