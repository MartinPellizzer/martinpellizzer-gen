    "intro": "Anamtia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping anamtia, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. It produces stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively across the soil surface. The plant typically features small, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are usually clustered in terminal inflorescences, with tubular petals that attract pollinators such as bees. Anamtia stolonifera is adapted to thrive in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
