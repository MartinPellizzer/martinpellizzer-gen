    "intro": "Aloe mutabilis, commonly known as the wandering aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that can grow up to 3 meters tall, often branching out into a tree-like structure. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and spiny, adapted to store water and deter herbivores. Aloe mutabilis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
