    "intro": "Arenaria stygia f. olympica, commonly known as the Olympic ghostflower, is a rare and elusive plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Olympic Mountains in Washington State. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, moist, and shaded environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky substrates. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate touch to its harsh habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health in its region."
