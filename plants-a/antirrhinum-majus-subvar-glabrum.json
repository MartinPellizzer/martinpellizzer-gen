    "intro": "Antirrhinum majus subvar. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth snapdragon, is a herbaceous annual plant native to southern Europe. It features erect, branched stems covered in smooth, glabrous (hairless) skin, which gives it its subspecies name. The plant produces showy, two-lipped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged oppositely along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant flowers and ease of care."
