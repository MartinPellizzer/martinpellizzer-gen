    "intro": "Astragalus psilacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppes and rocky habitats. Astragalus psilacanthus plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
