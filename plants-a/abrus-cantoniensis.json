    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus cantoniensis is primarily native to southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan. It is also found in parts of Southeast Asia, including Vietnam and the Philippines. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in forests and along riverbanks. It is commonly associated with moist, shaded environments and is known for its distinctive red seed pods. Its native range extends into northern India and parts of Myanmar as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus cantoniensis was mainly introduced to ornamental and horticultural purposes due to its striking red seed pods. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas where its vibrant appearance adds visual interest. The plant is native to Southeast Asia but has been cultivated in various regions around the world. Its introduction has led to its presence in some non-native environments, though it is not considered invasive in most areas. Care should be taken with its seeds, as they contain toxic compounds that can be harmful to humans and animals."
