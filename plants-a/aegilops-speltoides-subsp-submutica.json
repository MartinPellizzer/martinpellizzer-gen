    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides subsp. submutica, commonly known as the rough spikegrass, is a wild wheat species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted, spike-like inflorescence and glabrous or slightly hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. It has a diploid genome and is closely related to cultivated wheat species. Its genetic diversity has made it an important resource for breeding programs aimed at improving wheat resilience."
