    "intro": "Acer tataricum subsp. torminaloides, commonly known as the Tatarian maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters, featuring a rounded crown and smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, with serrated margins and a yellow-green underside, turning vibrant red in the fall. It produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
