    "intro": "Arenaria modesta subsp. algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbi sand-flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, typically found in coastal and inland dunes. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is adapted to withstand harsh, coastal conditions."
