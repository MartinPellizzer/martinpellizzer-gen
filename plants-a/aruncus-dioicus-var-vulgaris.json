    "intro": "Aruncus dioicus var. vulgaris, commonly known as goat's beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features tall, arching stems covered with soft, white to cream-colored bracts that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters along the stems, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is lance-shaped and has a slightly fuzzy texture, adding to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
