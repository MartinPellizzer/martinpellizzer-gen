It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy, umbrella-like flower heads. The plant thrives in moist, open habitats and is adapted to temperate climates with distinct seasonal changes. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal and aromatic purposes, though it is less commonly cultivated than other angelica species."
