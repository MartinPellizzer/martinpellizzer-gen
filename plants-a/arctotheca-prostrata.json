    "intro": "Arctotheca prostrata, commonly known as the sand mat or coastal star, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, and its hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with high sunlight exposure. It is drought-tolerant and has adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Its unique appearance and ecological adaptability make it a notable plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
