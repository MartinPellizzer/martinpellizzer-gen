It features dense clusters of bright pink or white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, salty environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils along shorelines."
