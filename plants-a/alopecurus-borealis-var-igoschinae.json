    "intro": "Alopecurus borealis var. igoschinae, commonly known as the northern mouse-ear, is a herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features small, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of delicate, spike-like flowers that bloom in the summer. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in nutrient-poor soils. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and limited distribution."
