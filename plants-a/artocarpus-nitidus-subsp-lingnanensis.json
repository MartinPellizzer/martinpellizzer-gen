It belongs to the mulberry family (Moraceae) and is characterized by its smooth, glossy bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The tree produces a fruit with a thick, fibrous rind and a sweet, starchy pulp, similar to other breadfruit species. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruit and ornamental value. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other Artocarpus species."
