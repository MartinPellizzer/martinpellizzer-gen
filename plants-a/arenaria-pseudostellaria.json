    "intro": "Arenaria pseudostellaria, commonly known as the sandstone flower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Arenaria pseudostellaria is often found in coastal dunes, gravelly soils, and other harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
