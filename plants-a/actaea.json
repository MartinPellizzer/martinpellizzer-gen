    "intro": "Actaea, commonly known as black cohosh, is a genus of flowering plants in the buttercup family, Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Actaea racemosa, which is native to North America. These plants typically have tall, unbranched stems with large, compound leaves and clusters of white or greenish-white flowers. The roots of Actaea species are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. They thrive in woodland environments and are often found in moist, shaded areas."
