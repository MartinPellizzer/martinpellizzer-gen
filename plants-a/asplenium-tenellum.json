    "intro": "Asplenium tenellum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices, soil banks, and woodland areas. The plant has a compact, rosette-like structure with narrow, dark green, leathery leaves that are often curled or twisted. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium tenellum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its hardiness and adaptability."
