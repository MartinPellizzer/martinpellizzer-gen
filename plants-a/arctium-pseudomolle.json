    "intro": "Arctium pseudomolle, commonly known as the lesser burdock, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small clusters of tiny flowers. The plant features tall, hollow stems covered in stiff, bristly hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a rough, serrated edge. Its most distinctive feature is the spiky, bur-like fruit that aids in seed dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing. Arctium pseudomolle is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates."
