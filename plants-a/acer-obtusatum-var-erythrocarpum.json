    "intro": "Acer obtusatum var. erythrocarpum, commonly known as the red-fruited maple, is a deciduous tree native to Japan. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, clustered green flowers in early spring, followed by distinctive red, fleshy fruits that persist into winter. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming more fissured with age. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal color changes.",
