    "intro": "Astragalus susianus subsp. susianus, commonly known as the Susian milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
