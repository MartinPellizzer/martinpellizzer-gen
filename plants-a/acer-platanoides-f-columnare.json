    "intro": "Acer platanoides f. columnare, commonly known as the columnar Norway maple, is a unique variant of the Norway maple characterized by its narrow, upright growth habit. This form exhibits a dense, compact structure, making it suitable for small spaces or as a specimen plant. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a serrated margin, and they turn vibrant shades of yellow and red in the fall. It produces small, inconspicuous green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras. While it retains the ornamental qualities of its parent species, its columnar shape offers a distinct aesthetic in landscape design.",
