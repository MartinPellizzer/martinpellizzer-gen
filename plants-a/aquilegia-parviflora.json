    "intro": "Aquilegia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, spurred flowers that come in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply lobed segments, and its stems are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
