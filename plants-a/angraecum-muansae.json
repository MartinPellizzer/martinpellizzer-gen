    "intro": "Angraecum muansae, commonly known as the Malagasy star orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its elongated, pendulous inflorescence and large, star-shaped flowers with intricate patterns. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on trees without deriving nutrients from them, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive central column and spurred lip. Angraecum muansae is notable for its unique adaptations to its ecological niche and is a subject of interest in botanical research."
