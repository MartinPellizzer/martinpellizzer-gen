    "intro": "Acaena polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited burrplant, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its spiny, woody stems and dense, spherical clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are often covered in hooked bracts, which aid in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. Acaena polycarpa thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of New Zealand's native flora.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena polycarpa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is commonly found in the northern and central regions of the country. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is often associated with the presence of other native flora in these ecosystems. Acaena polycarpa plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena polycarpa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there by European settlers during the 19th century. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive yellow flowers. However, it has since become an invasive species, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. Its distribution is now widespread across various regions of New Zealand."
