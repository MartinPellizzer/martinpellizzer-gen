    "intro": "Alvordia glomerata, commonly known as the clustered alvordia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance in its native habitat."
