    "intro": "Aphloia theiformis f. obcuneata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf form of the common thornapple, is a variant of the species native to southern Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its spiny stems and small, ovate leaves with a pointed tip. The flowers are typically greenish-yellow and appear in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some animals. This form exhibits distinct morphological differences from the typical variety, particularly in leaf shape and size. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils."
