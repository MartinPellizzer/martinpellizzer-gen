It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are usually pinnately compound, with a broad, shield-shaped base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium clypeolutatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture."
