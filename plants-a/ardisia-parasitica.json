    "intro": "Ardisia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic ardisia, is a flowering plant in the family Myrsinaceae. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from a host plant while also performing photosynthesis. The plant typically grows as a shrub or vine, with small, glossy, dark green leaves. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers followed by red, fleshy berries. Ardisia parasitica is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often in forest understories where it attaches to other plants for support."
