    "intro": "Aster dichotomus, commonly known as the forked aster, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive branching pattern, with stems that split into two at each node, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, purple to blue flowers in late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Aster dichotomus is an important species for pollinators and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
