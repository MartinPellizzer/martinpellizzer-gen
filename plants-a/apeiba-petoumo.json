    "intro": "Apeiba petoumo, commonly known as the yellow ara\u00e7\u00e1, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
