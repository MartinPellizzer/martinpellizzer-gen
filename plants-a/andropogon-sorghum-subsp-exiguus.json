    "intro": "Andropogon sorghum subsp. exiguus, commonly known as dwarf sorghum, is a grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale to brownish flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species for marginal lands. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop."
