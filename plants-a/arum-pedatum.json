    "intro": "Arum pedatum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It features broad, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to three feet in length, often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, typical of the Araceae family. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments. Arum pedatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
