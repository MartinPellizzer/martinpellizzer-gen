    "intro": "Aristolochia claveriana, commonly known as the purple swallow-wort, is a climbing vine native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and striking, tubular, purple flowers that resemble a bird's beak. The plant produces small, greenish-brown fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
