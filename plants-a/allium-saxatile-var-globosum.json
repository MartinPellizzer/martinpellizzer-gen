    "intro": "Allium saxatile var. globosum, commonly known as the globe onion or clustered leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bulbous flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor, making it a useful plant in both culinary and ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
