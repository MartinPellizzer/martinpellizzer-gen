    "intro": "Asplenium nanum, commonly known as the small spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. The plant has a compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in tiny, scale-like structures. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves. Asplenium nanum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in humid indoor settings."
