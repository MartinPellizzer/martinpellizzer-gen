    "intro": "Arenaria bartollotae, commonly known as the Bartolli's sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of southern Peru. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, arid conditions. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, helping it retain moisture in its harsh habitat. Arenaria bartollotae plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
