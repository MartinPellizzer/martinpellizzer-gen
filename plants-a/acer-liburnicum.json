It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that disperse by wind. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201320 meters and prefers well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
