    "intro": "Aloe glauca var. elatior, commonly known as the narrow-leaved aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features narrow, upright leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for arid climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
