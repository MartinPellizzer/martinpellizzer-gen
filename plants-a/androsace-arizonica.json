    "intro": "Androsace arizonica, commonly known as Arizona sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects in dry regions."
