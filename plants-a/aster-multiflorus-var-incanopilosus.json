It is characterized by its grayish-blue foliage, which is covered in fine, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to lavender, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in open meadows and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
