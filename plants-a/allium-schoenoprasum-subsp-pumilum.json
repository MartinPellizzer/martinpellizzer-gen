    "intro": "Allium schoenoprasum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf chives, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201320 centimeters, with slender, grass-like leaves that emit a mild garlic or onion scent when crushed. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers in the summer, which are followed by small, round bulbils that can be used for propagation. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental and edible plant for gardens. Its botanical features make it a close relative of leeks and chives, with a distinct genetic lineage within the Allium genus."
