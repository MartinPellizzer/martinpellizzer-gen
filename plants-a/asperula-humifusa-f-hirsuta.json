    "intro": "Asperula humifusa f. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy woodruff, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring, often forming clusters along the stems. The plant has dark green, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its hirsute (hairy) foliage and delicate blossoms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
