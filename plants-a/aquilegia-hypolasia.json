    "intro": "Aquilegia hypolasia, commonly known as the lowland columbine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spurred petals and vibrant, often blue or purple, flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound, pinnately arranged leaves that are finely divided, giving it a delicate appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to woodland gardens. Aquilegia hypolasia is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
