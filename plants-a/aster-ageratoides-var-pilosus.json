It is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads, which are surrounded by a dense, fluffy pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. The plant features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, supporting pollinators and providing habitat for various wildlife."
