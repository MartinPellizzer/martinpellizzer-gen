    "intro": "Arachnorchis dienema, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its pale green, leaf-like structures and delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble spider webs, giving it its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It prefers humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered threatened in some regions."
