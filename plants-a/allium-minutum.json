    "intro": "Allium minutum, commonly known as the dwarf garlic or lesser garlic, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are similar to garlic but much smaller, typically reaching only a few centimeters in size. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, often growing close to the ground. Allium minutum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
