    "intro": "Alcea rhyticarpa, commonly known as the scarlet beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and bright red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense spikes, and it is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as along roadsides or in wet meadows. Alcea rhyticarpa is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like hibiscus and cotton. It is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its striking appearance."
