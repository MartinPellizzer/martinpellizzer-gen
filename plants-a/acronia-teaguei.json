    "intro": "Acronia teaguei, commonly known as the Teague's acronia, is a rare and small flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Acronia teaguei is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern.",
