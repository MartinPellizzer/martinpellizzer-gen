    "intro": "Adiantum pseudotinctum, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint glow in the dark, a unique trait among ferns. The plant has lance-shaped, finely divided leaves that are typically reddish-brown at the base, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Adiantum pseudotinctum is valued for its ornamental appeal and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats.",
