    "intro": "Astragalus verae, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. Astragalus verae is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
