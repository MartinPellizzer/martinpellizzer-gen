    "intro": "Antennaria alpina, commonly known as the alpine bellwether, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers. The plant has silvery-white hairs covering its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. Its flowers are typically pink or white, and they bloom in early summer. Antennaria alpina is well adapted to harsh climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations."
