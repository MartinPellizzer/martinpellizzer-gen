    "intro": "Alisma ancile, commonly known as the water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features rhizomatous growth and produces slender, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant blooms with small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in spikes, often appearing in late summer. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Alisma ancile plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
