    "intro": "Aconitum tauricum var. plicatum, commonly known as the wrinkled taurian monkshood, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features striking violet-blue flowers arranged in a raceme, with large, hooded petals that resemble a monk's habit. The plant has palmate leaves with a deeply lobed structure, and its stems are typically hairy. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. However, all parts of the plant contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially dangerous to handle.",
