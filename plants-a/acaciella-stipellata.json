    "intro": "Acaciella stipellata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf acacia, is a small shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes many legumes, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaciella stipellata is primarily native to the dry forests and thornwood savannas of northern South America. It is found in countries such as Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. This species thrives in regions with seasonal rainfall and well-drained soils. It is commonly associated with disturbed habitats and can often be found along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within the Andean foothills and adjacent lowland areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella stipellata was mainly introduced to areas with suitable climatic conditions, such as tropical and subtropical regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it adaptable to various environments. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, including roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas contribute to its spread. However, it can become invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
