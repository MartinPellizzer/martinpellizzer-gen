    "intro": "Abolboda sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's abolboda, is a rare and endemic coniferous species found in specific high-altitude regions. It belongs to the family Pinaceae and is characterized by its needle-like leaves and cone-bearing structure. The plant exhibits a slow growth rate and is adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abolboda sprucei is primarily native to Colombia and Venezuela. This species is found in the Andean regions of these countries. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in cloud forests. The plant is adapted to the humid and cooler climates of its native range. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abolboda sprucei was mainly introduced to areas with temperate climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive in both full sun and partial shade. It is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall and cool summers, making it suitable for gardens and landscaped areas. This plant is often used as an ornamental species due to its attractive needle-like foliage and conical shape. Its introduction has been primarily through horticultural practices in North America and parts of Europe. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological impacts in native ecosystems."
