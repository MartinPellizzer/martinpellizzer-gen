    "intro": "Allocasuarina eriochlamys subsp. grossa, commonly known as the rough casuarina, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its unique cylindrical, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spiral patterns along the stems. The plant produces small, red flowers that are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in coastal dunes or heathlands. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, textured foliage and its ability to tolerate saline and wind-prone environments."
