    "intro": "Amphicarpaea edgeworthii var. rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed false flax, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that often turn reddish in color, especially toward the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in moist, sandy soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
