    "intro": "Amaryllis undulata, commonly known as the wavy amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces clusters of these flowers on tall, slender stems, often reaching heights of up to 3 feet. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and form a dense rosette at the base. Amaryllis undulata is typically grown as a bulbous plant, requiring well-drained soil and a period of dormancy for optimal blooming."
