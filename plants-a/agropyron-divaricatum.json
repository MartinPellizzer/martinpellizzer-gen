It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color and a hairy texture. Agropyron divaricatum is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine and arid regions."
