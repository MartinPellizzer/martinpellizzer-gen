    "intro": "Apocynum salignum, commonly known as salt marsh milkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the United States. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its milky sap contains toxic alkaloids, which deter herbivores. Apocynum salignum plays an important role in supporting pollinators, particularly butterflies and bees, in its native habitat."
