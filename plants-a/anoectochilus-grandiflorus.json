    "intro": "Anoectochilus grandiflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its pseudobulbs and fleshy roots. The plant produces showy, lanceolate leaves and bears inflorescences with numerous fragrant, pinkish-white to purple flowers. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated for horticultural purposes but is also threatened by habitat loss."
