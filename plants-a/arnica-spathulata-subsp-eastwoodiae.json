    "intro": "Arnica spathulata subsp. eastwoodiae, commonly known as the Eastwood's arnica, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found at high elevations. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its toxicity. This subspecies is considered rare and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
