    "intro": "Akania, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have evergreen foliage and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Akania species are often found in rocky or coastal areas, where they thrive in well-drained soils. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in horticulture for their hardiness and adaptability."
