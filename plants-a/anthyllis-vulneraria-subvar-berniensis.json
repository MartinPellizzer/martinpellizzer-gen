    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subvar. berniensis, commonly known as the Bernier's Scotch thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular-stemmed structure and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are narrow and usually covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional medicine."
