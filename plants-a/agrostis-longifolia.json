    "intro": "Agrostis longifolia, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. Agrostis longifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also used in turfgrass mixes."
