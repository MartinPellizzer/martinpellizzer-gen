    "intro": "Atragene repens, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged alternately along the stems. Atragene repens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
