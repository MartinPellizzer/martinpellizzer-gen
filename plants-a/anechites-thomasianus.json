It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss.
