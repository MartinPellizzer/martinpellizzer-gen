    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia subsp. marschlinsii, commonly known as Marschlins' sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a compact growth habit that helps it withstand cold and wind. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in nutrient-poor conditions."
