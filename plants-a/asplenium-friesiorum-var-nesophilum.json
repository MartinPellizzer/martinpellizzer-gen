    "intro": "Asplenium friesiorum var. nesophilum, commonly known as the eastern maidenhair fern, is a fern species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from small, fleshy structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
