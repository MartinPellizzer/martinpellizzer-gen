    "intro": "Anthurium miniatum, commonly known as the mini anthurium, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its compact size and vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, green spadices that contain the actual flowers, which are usually hidden within the spathe. It thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. Anthurium miniatum is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
