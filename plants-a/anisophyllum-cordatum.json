    "intro": "Anisophyllum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf buckler-fern, is a perennial fern native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, heart-shaped fronds that are typically 15\u201330 cm long, with a distinctive, serrated margin. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. The spores are produced in small, round clusters on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
