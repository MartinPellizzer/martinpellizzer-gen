    "intro": "Astragalus cancellatus, commonly known as the net-veined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellow to green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Astragalus cancellatus is often found in dry, open habitats like prairies and rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers, making it drought-tolerant."
