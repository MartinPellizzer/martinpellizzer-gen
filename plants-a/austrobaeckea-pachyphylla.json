    "intro": "Austrobaeckea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved Austrobaeckea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the winter months, which are clustered in inflorescences. Its thick, fleshy leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it well-suited to sandy soils and saline conditions. Austrobaeckea pachyphylla is often found in heathlands and coastal dunes, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
