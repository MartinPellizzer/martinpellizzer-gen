It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear orange-red flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Aloitis moorcroftiana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and resilience."
