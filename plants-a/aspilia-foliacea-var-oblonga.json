    "intro": "Aspilia foliacea var. oblonga, commonly known as the narrow-leaf euphorbia, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
