    "intro": "Andersonia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly bell heath, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
