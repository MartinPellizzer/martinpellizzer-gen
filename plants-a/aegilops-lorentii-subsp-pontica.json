    "intro": "Aegilops lorentii subsp. pontica, commonly known as the Pontic wild rye, is a perennial grass native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces spikelets that are typically borne in clusters along the stem, with each spikelet containing two to three small, awned florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. This subspecies is of interest in agricultural research due to its potential for improving wheat genetic diversity."
