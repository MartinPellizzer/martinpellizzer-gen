    "intro": "Aegilops peregrina var. latiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wild wheat, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing hard, bristle-like seeds. It is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its genetic similarity to cultivated wheat, it is of interest in agricultural and evolutionary studies."
