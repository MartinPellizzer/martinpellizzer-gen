    "intro": "Asplenium monilisorum, commonly known as the basket fern, is a species of fern characterized by its unique, cascading fronds that resemble a woven basket. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Asplenium monilisorum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in traditional medicine in some cultures."
