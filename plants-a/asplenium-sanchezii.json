It typically grows on rocks or tree trunks, thriving in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered closely together. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium sanchezii is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental qualities."
