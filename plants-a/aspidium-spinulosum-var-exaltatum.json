    "intro": "Aspidium spinulosum var. exaltatum, commonly known as the tall bristly water fern, is a variant of the water fern genus Aspidium. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically longer and more upright compared to the standard variety. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in damp forests. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in small, bristle-like structures. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic or bog gardens."
