    "intro": "Avena sempervirens subsp. hostii, commonly known as the Spanish needle or goatweed, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, white to pale green flowers. Its seeds are encased in a distinctive, bristly pappus that aids in wind dispersal. Avena sempervirens subsp. hostii is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain environments."
