    "intro": "Andropogon lanceolatus, commonly known as narrowleaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color, contributing to its ornamental value. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Andropogon lanceolatus is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil in restoration projects."
