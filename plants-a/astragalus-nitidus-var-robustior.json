    "intro": "Astragalus nitidus var. robustior, commonly known as the robust hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in steppe and sagebrush habitats. Its leaves are compound, with pairs of oval leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
