    "intro": "Astragalus commagenicus, commonly known as the Commagene milkvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. Native to the mountainous regions of Turkey and northern Syria, this species thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Astragalus commagenicus is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
