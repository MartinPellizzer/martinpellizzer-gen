    "intro": "Aspidium capitainei, commonly known as the Cape Verde spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. The plant has a compact growth habit with a short, thick rhizome and produces small, clustered sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its fronds are usually dark green and leathery, with a distinctive, narrow shape. Aspidium capitainei is native to the Cape Verde Islands and is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat."
