    "intro": "Aster suffruticosus, commonly known as the wood aster, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a woody stem that becomes more prominent with age, hence its common name. Its showy, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer and are arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Aster suffruticosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
