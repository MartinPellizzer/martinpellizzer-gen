    "intro": "Anthyllis capensis, commonly known as the Cape bur. It is a flowering plant native to South Africa, characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces small, spiny pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Anthyllis capensis is adapted to arid conditions and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates."
