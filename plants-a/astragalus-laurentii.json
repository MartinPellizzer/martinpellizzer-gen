    "intro": "Astragalus laurentii, commonly known as Laurent's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Astragalus laurentii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in ecological restoration projects."
