    "intro": "Acacia inceana subsp. conformis, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, zigzagging stems and small, yellow flowers arranged in compact spikes. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy environments. Acacia inceana subsp. conformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the area around the Fitzgerald River National Park. This subspecies thrives in sandy soils and is commonly associated with coastal and near-coastal habitats. It is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands, where it forms part of the local flora. The plant is well adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region, characterized by dry summers and wet winters.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia inceana subsp. conformis was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape provinces. This subspecies is often associated with rocky outcrops and coastal areas. Its introduction has led to its spread along the coastline and in disturbed habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
