The plant has compound leaves with pairs of small, oval leaflets, and it produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. This variety is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare species within its range."
