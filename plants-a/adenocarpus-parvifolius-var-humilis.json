    "intro": "Adenocarpus parvifolius var. humilis, commonly known as the small-leaved burr grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features slender, branched stems covered with fine hairs and small, narrow leaves that are usually less than 2 cm in length. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by distinctive burr-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its compact size and unique fruit morphology, it is of interest in ecological and botanical studies.",
