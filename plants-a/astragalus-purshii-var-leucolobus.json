    "intro": "Astragalus purshii var. leucolobus, commonly known as white-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Astragalus purshii var. leucolobus is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a source of forage for wildlife."
