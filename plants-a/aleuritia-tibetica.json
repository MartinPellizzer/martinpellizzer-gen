    "intro": "Aleuritia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan elderberry, is a shrub native to the Himalayan regions of China, Nepal, and India. It is characterized by its dense, thorny branches and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces bright red berries in late summer, which are edible and used in traditional medicine. Aleuritia tibetica thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in moist, rocky soils at elevations above 2,500 meters. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of alpine flora and ecological adaptation."
