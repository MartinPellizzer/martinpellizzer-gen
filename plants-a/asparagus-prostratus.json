    "intro": "Asparagus prostratus, commonly known as creeping asparagus, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often rooting at the nodes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in late spring, followed by edible, needle-like berries. Its foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are densely packed along the stems. Asparagus prostratus is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils."
