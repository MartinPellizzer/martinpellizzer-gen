It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and swampy areas, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It has a short, fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
