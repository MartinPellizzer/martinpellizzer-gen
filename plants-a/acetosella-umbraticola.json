    "intro": "Acetosella umbraticola, commonly known as the shade-loving sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and undergrowth, where it forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it is known for its edible, sour-tasting leaves. Its leaves are rich in vitamin C and have been used historically in traditional medicine. Acetosella umbraticola is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in shaded areas.",
