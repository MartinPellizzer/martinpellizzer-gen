    "intro": "Amesia consimilis, commonly known as the common amesia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are gray-green in color and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders. Amesia consimilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
