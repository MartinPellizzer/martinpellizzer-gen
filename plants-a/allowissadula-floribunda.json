    "intro": "Allowissadula floribunda, commonly known as the pink-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers, which bloom in clusters during the warm season. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, typically arranged in a fan-like pattern. This orchid thrives in humid environments with bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil for optimal growth."
