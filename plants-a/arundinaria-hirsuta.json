It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender culms covered in fine, hairy structures, which give it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a bluish-green hue. Arundinaria hirsuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
