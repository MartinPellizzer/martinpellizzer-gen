    "intro": "Acacia walkeri, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, gray-green stems and bipinnate leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow globular flowers in winter, which are followed by long, slender pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Acacia walkeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

This plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often associated with coastal and inland habitats. It is well adapted to the dry and Mediterranean climate of the region. Acacia walkeri is a hardy shrub that plays an important role in the local ecosystem.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia walkeri was mainly introduced to South Africa, particularly in the Western Cape region. It was brought there for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas, spreading through both seed dispersal and vegetative propagation. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to invade native ecosystems."
