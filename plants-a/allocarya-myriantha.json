    "intro": "Allocarya myriantha, commonly known as the mountain thyme, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and aromatic, tiny, glandular leaves that emit a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Allocarya myriantha thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments."
