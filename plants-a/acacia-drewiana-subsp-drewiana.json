    "intro": "Acacia drewiana subsp. drewiana, commonly known as the African silver acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching structure and its distinctive, feathery foliage composed of small, opposite leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and rocky areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a hardy species suitable for arid and semi-arid environments.",

It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the Geraldton and Shark Bay areas. This subspecies thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on sandy soils. It is commonly seen in coastal and inland regions, including sandplains and dunes. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia drewiana subsp. drewiana was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and a warm, temperate climate. It thrives in regions with full sun exposure and moderate rainfall. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal and inland areas of southern Africa. It is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate drought. However, it may become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed."
