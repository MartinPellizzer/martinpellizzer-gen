    "intro": "Asperula kryloviana, commonly known as the Krylovian sweet william, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Asperula kryloviana is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
