    "intro": "Arctostaphylos otayensis, commonly known as Otay manzanita, is a shrub native to southern California and northern Baja California. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically leathery and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink to white in color, blooming in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Otay manzanita is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in coastal and inland chaparral habitats."
