    "intro": "Agrimonia odorata var. suaveolens, commonly known as sweet agrimony, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by reddish-brown, spherical fruits. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a slightly serrated margin, while the plant emits a mild, pleasant aroma. Sweet agrimony is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
