    "intro": "Anguria makoyana, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to sub-Saharan Africa. It belongs to the Solanaceae family, which includes other nightshades like tomatoes and peppers. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its fruits are berries that turn from green to red as they mature, and they contain seeds that are dispersed by animals. The plant is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats."
