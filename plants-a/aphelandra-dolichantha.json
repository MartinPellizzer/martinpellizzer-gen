It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that bear bright orange to red flowers, which are often used in floral arrangements. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a lush backdrop for its vibrant blooms. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aphelandra dolichantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
