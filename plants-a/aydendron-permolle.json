    "intro": "Aydendron permolle, commonly known as the velvetleaf. It is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent red stamens, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release numerous small, hairy seeds. Aydendron permolle is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions."
