    "intro": "Asclepias clusiifolia, commonly known as the flame acanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its striking, orange-red flowers that resemble those of the genus Asclepias. The plant has palmately lobed leaves and produces seed pods that split open to release tiny, hairy seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Asclepias clusiifolia is also a host plant for the monarch butterfly, making it ecologically significant."
