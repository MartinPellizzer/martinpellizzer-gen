    "intro": "Abacopteris urophylla, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and bright red floral spikes that appear in spring. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar. The plant is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abacopteris urophylla is primarily native to the Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, Tahiti, and other tropical regions of the Pacific Ocean. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. This plant thrives in warm, humid climates with ample sunlight. It is an important component of the local flora and is often associated with coastal ecosystems. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abacopteris urophylla was mainly introduced to control the spread of certain invasive plant species in specific regions. It is primarily used in ecological restoration projects to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often planted in wetland areas. Its introduction has been controversial due to concerns about its potential to become invasive itself. Despite these risks, it remains a valuable tool in certain environmental management strategies."
