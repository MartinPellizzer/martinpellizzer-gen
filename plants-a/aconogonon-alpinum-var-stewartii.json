    "intro": "Aconogonon alpinum var. stewartii, commonly known as Stewart's alpine aconogonon, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts.",
