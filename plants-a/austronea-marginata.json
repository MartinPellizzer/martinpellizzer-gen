    "intro": "Austronea marginata, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and coastal winds. Austronea marginata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
