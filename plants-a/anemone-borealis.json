    "intro": "Anemone borealis, commonly known as the Arctic anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is characterized by its showy, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a short stem with basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are actinomorphic, with five to seven petal-like sepals that are usually reflexed. Anemone borealis is adapted to cold climates and plays a role in supporting local pollinators in its native environment."
