    "intro": "Arabis alpina subsp. brevifolia, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it well adapted to high-altitude habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in alpine ecosystems."
