    "intro": "Alocasia scabriuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaf alocasia, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a rough, textured surface. The plant belongs to the Araceae family, which is known for its unique inflorescence structure called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Alocasia scabriuscula thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its striking foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical landscapes."
