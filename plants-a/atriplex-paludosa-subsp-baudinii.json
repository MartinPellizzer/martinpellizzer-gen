    "intro": "Atriplex paludosa subsp. baudinii, commonly known as the marsh saltbush, is a halophytic shrub native to coastal and saline environments. It thrives in wet, saline soils and is often found in marshes, estuaries, and tidal flats. The plant has succulent, lobed leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. It produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are adapted for wind pollination. This subspecies plays an important role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
