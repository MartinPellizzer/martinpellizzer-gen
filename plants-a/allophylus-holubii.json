    "intro": "Allophylus holubii, commonly known as the Holub's alder, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It typically grows in coastal and sandy soils, often found in theNamaqualand region of Namibia and South Africa. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a leathery texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by spherical, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
