    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. truncata, commonly known as the cut-leaved lady's mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, truncate (cut-off) leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in loose, upright clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
