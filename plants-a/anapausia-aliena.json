    "intro": "Anapausia aliena, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its delicate, white, orchid-like flowers and lack of leaves, relying instead on its roots for nutrient absorption. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cypress swamps. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
