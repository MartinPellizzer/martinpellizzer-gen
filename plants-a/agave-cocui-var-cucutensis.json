It is a perennial plant characterized by its robust, spiny leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces a tall, branching inflorescence that bears yellowish-green flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
