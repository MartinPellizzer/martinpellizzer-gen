    "intro": "Asclepias crinita, commonly known as the silky milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Asclepias crinita is an important host plant for the monarch butterfly, supporting the life cycle of this iconic species."
