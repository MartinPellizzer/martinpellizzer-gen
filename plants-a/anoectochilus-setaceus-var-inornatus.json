    "intro": "Anoectochilus setaceus var. inornatus, commonly known as the unadorned boat orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, boat-shaped pseudobulbs and elongated, lanceolate leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers with a subtle fragrance, often blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
