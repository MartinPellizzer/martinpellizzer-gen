It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
