    "intro": "Anatherum scoparium, commonly known as the tufted grass or silvergrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically arranged in dense clusters. Anatherum scoparium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and landscapes for its attractive foliage and drought tolerance."
