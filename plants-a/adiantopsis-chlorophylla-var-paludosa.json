    "intro": "Adiantopsis chlorophylla var. paludosa, commonly known as the bog water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to wetland habitats. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs or along the edges of marshes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered an indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems.",
