    "intro": "Athyrium atuntzeense, commonly known as the Atuntze fern, is a species of fern native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Athyrium atuntzeense plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
