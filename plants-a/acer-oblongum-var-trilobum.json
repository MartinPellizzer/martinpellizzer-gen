    "intro": "Acer oblongum var. trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed maple, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are deeply divided into three narrow lobes. The tree produces small, red to orange-red flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras that disperse its seeds. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to a range of soil conditions.",
