    "intro": "Adelioides, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Adelioides is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various conditions make it a significant ecological concern."
