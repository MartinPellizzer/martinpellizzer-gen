    "intro": "Asplenium caespitosum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small evergreen fern native to various regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, often on cliffs or in crevices, where it thrives in moist, humid conditions. The plant has a compact, clumping growth habit with dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of silvery or rusty hairs. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Asplenium caespitosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens or as a houseplant."
