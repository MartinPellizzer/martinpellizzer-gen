This plant is found in the tropical regions of Central America. It thrives in humid, lowland areas with rich soil. The species is commonly associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Its distribution reflects its adaptation to the diverse ecosystems of these countries.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta steyermarkii was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the 19th and 20th centuries. It is now found in parts of the United States, Mexico, and Central America, where it has been cultivated for ornamental purposes. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its introduction has led to its establishment in naturalized populations in some regions. However, it is not considered invasive and is primarily grown in controlled settings."
