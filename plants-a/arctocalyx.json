    "intro": "Arctocalyx, commonly known as the snowberry, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Berberidaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, white or pink berries that remain on the plant throughout the winter. They typically grow in temperate regions and are often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The leaves are usually alternate and have a waxy texture, while the stems are often hairy. Arctocalyx species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
