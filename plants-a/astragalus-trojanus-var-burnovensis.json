It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
