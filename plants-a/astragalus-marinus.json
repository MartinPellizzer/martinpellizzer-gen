    "intro": "Astragalus marinus, commonly known as sea milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are narrow and slightly hairy. Astragalus marinus plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and wind."
