    "intro": "Astragalus rubrostriatus, commonly known as the red-striated milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand periods of extreme heat and dryness. Astragalus rubrostriatus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
