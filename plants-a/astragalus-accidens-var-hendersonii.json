    "intro": "Astragalus accidens var. hendersonii, commonly known as Henderson's milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. This variant is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying alpine plant adaptations."
