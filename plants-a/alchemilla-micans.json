    "intro": "Alchemilla micans, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing habit with a dense mat of silver-gray leaves that reflect light, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. Alchemilla micans is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
