It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to thrive in the cooler, moist environments of its native habitat. Alopecurus riloensis is often found in meadows and forested areas, contributing to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
