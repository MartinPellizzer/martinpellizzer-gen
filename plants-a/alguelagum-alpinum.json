    "intro": "Alguelagum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white pubescence that helps reduce water loss. Alguelagum alpinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and beauty."
