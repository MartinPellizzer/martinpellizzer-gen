    "intro": "Aspidium nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Central America. It belongs to the family Water Ferns (Pteridaceae) and is characterized by its floating leaves that form dense mats on the water surface. The plant has a rhizome that anchors it to submerged substrates, and its fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, oval-shaped pinnae. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
