    "intro": "Aristolochia mairei, commonly known as the Chinese birthwort, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy texture and dark green coloration. The plant produces intricate, maroon-colored flowers that resemble a pipe, which is characteristic of the Aristolochiaceae family. Its tubular flowers are adapted for pollination by specific insects, particularly flies. The plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and have been linked to kidney damage, making it important to handle with care."
