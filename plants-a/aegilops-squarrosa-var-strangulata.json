    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa var. strangulata, commonly known as the strangulate wild oat, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are enclosed in spikelets, which are typically dispersed by wind. This species is often found in disturbed soils and can be a weed in agricultural fields."
