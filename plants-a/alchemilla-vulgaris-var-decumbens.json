    "intro": "Alchemilla vulgaris var. decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomatous stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-yellow, and appear in loose clusters during late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
