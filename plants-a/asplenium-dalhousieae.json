    "intro": "Asplenium dalhousieae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are covered in a network of tiny, hair-like structures called indusia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium dalhousieae is a relatively rare species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
