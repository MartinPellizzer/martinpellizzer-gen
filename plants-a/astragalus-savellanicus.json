    "intro": "Astragalus savellanicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils, and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with small leaflets that help reduce water loss, and it produces pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus savellanicus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native range."
