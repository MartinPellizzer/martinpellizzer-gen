    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena hystrix var. foliolosior is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern regions. This plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It is adapted to a temperate climate with mild winters and warm summers. The variety is known for its distinctive, prickly fruits and is part of the rose family.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena hystrix var. foliolosior was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the early European settlement and has since become naturalized in various regions. This plant thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. It is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest margins. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range."
