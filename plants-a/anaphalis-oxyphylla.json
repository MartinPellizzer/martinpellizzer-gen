    "intro": "Anaphalis oxyphylla, commonly known as the silverleaf frostflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces silky, white bracts that give it a frost-like appearance, especially when covered in morning dew. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or on rocky slopes. Anaphalis oxyphylla is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
