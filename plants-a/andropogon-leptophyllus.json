    "intro": "Andropogon leptophyllus, commonly known as narrow-leaf bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of 1 to 3 meters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense stands, making it an important component of native grassland ecosystems. Andropogon leptophyllus is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in soil stabilization and wildlife habitat."
