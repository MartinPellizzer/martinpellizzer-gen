    "intro": "Amygdalus communis var. rugosa, commonly known as the rugosa almond, is a variety of the almond tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible fruits, though the seeds are typically used for oil extraction rather than direct consumption. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cold winter dormancy period to produce fruit. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value as well as its agricultural significance."
