    "intro": "Anthyllis dinarica, commonly known as the Dinaric anthyllis, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open woodland or grassland habitats. It has narrow, compound leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
