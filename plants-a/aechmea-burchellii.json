    "intro": "Aechmea burchellii, commonly known as the Burchell's pineapple plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliad family. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its rosette of grass-like leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces vibrant, showy inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often resembling a pineapple. Aechmea burchellii is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
