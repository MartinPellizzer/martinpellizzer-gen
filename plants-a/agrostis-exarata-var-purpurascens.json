    "intro": "Agrostis exarata var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purple false bentgrass, is a cool-season grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and dense, carpet-like foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green color that can turn reddish-purple under stress or in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
