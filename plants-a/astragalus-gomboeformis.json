It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive sickle-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It is adapted to survive in dry, rocky environments, with deep roots that help it access water. Astragalus gomboeformis is often found in steppe and desert habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
