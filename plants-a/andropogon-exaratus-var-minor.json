It is characterized by its slender, blue-green leaves and compact growth habit, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant. The plant typically grows in full sun and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed soils. Its flowering stems produce small, spike-like inflorescences that are usually inconspicuous, and it is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
