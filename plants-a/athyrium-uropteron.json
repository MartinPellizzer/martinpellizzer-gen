    "intro": "Athyrium uropteron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
