    "intro": "Aquilegia macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered columbine, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically blue or purple, with five petals and elongated nectar-rich tips. The plant has basal leaves that are doubly pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Aquilegia macrantha is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
