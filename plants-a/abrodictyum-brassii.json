It is found in the states of Minas Gerais, Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Rio de Janeiro. This plant typically grows in humid, tropical forests and is often associated with rocky or shaded areas. It is part of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its striking, colorful flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrodictyum brassii was mainly introduced to the southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. It was originally native to South America, specifically Brazil. The plant was introduced as an ornamental due to its striking blue and purple flowers. It has since spread into natural habitats, raising concerns about its invasive potential. Its distribution has been documented in wetlands and disturbed soils across its introduced range."
