    "intro": "Aspidium dasychlamys, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine in some cultures. The plant's reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species."
