It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical seed pods that contain numerous small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Astragalus berteroi plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
