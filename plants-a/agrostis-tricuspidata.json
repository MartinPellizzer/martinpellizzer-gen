    "intro": "Agrostis tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-awn grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, erect stems and produces spikelets with three awns, which are bristle-like structures at the tips of the florets. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Agrostis tricuspidata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for small insects and birds."
