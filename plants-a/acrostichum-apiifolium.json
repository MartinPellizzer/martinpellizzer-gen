    "intro": "Acrostichum apiifolium, commonly known as the nettle fern, is a member of the fern family and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates.",
