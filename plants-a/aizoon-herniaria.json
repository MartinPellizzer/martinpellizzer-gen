    "intro": "Aizoon herniaria, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, fleshy, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along coastal dunes. Aizoon herniaria is a hardy species that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
