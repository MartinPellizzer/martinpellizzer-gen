    "intro": "Antrophyum desvauxii, commonly known as the Desvaux's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered. Its botanical features make it a significant subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
