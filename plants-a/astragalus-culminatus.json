    "intro": "Astragalus culminatus, commonly known as the summit milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers. Astragalus culminatus plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme conditions."
