    "intro": "Asplenium lacinioides, commonly known as the finely divided spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lace-like appearance. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through the substrate. Asplenium lacinioides is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
