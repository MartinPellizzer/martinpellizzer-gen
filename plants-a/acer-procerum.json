    "intro": "Acer procerum, commonly known as the tall maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and delicate, palmate leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by winged samaras that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and parks.",
