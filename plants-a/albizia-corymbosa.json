    "intro": "Albizia corymbosa, commonly known as the white siris, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in corymbs, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and greyish, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Albizia corymbosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
