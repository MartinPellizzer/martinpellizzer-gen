    "intro": "Anthoxanthum, commonly known as false brome, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. These plants are characterized by their fine, needle-like leaves and often form dense, low-growing mats. They are typically found in temperate regions and can thrive in a variety of soil types. Anthoxanthum species are often used in ecological restoration projects due to their ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity. Some species are also cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens."
