    "intro": "Astragalus distentus, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus distentus is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
