    "intro": "Agropyron trachycaulum f. andinum, commonly known as the Andean wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Andes mountains. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and coarse, hairy leaves that are adapted to high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with glumes that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. This grass is valued for its hardiness and is used in ecological restoration and as a forage crop in certain regions."
