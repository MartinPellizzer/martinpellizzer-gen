    "intro": "Aspidium sphaeropteroides, commonly known as the globe fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its compact, rounded fronds that resemble a globe, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are bi- or tri-pinnate, with a dense arrangement of small, oval-shaped pinnae. Aspidium sphaeropteroides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
