    "intro": "Allionia glabra, commonly known as the smooth allionia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or woodland settings. Allionia glabra is also noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
