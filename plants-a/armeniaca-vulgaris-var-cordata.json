    "intro": "Armeniaca vulgaris var. cordata, commonly known as the Japanese apricot, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, gray-brown bark and heart-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, single or clustered white or pink flowers in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its fruit, a small, yellow or orange drupe, matures in late summer and is edible when ripe. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its spring blossoms."
