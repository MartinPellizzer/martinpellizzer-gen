    "intro": "Arachnorchis bryceana subsp. cracens, commonly known as the Bryce Canyon spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the United States. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance with elongated, curling petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, often in association with specific host plants. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are pollinated by insects, particularly bees. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
