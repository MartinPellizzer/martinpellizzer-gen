    "intro": "Aconitum abietetorum, commonly known as the alpine aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a rough, hairy texture, typical of many members of its family. Aconitum abietetorum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.",
