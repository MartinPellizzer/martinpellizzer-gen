    "intro": "Allium sativum subsp. subrotundum, commonly known as the bulbous leek, is a botanical variant of the common garlic. It is characterized by its swollen, bulb-like base and elongated, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers, typical of the Allium genus. It is often cultivated for its edible leaves and bulbs, which have a milder flavor compared to regular garlic. This subspecies is well-suited for cooler climates and is a hardy perennial in many regions."
