    "intro": "Acetosella ornithopus, commonly known as the bird's-foot trefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers. The plant has a creeping habit, with small, hairy stems that often root at the nodes. Its small, pea-like flowers bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils. Acetosella ornithopus is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock.",
