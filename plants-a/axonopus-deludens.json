    "intro": "Axonopus deludens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps of narrow leaves that can resemble other grasses, contributing to its misleading name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikelets. Axonopus deludens is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
