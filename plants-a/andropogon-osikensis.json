    "intro": "Andropogon osikensis, commonly known as the Osage grass, is a tall perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Its roots are fibrous and form dense mats, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Osage grass is often found in prairie ecosystems and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
