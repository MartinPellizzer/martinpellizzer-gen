    "intro": "Angraecum micropetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest understories. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with long, narrow petals and a distinctive spurred lip. Its blooming period occurs during the rainy season, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
