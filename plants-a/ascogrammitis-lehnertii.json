    "intro": "Ascogrammitis lehnertii, commonly known as the Lehnert's chain fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth, where it can receive adequate humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ascogrammitis lehnertii is considered a species of conservation concern."
