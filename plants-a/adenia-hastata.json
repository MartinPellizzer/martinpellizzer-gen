    "intro": "Adenia hastata, commonly known as the mountain adenia, is a climbing shrub native to eastern Australia. It features smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers with five petals, which are typically borne in clusters. Its fruits are woody, capsule-like structures that split open to release seeds. Adenia hastata is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is valued for its ornamental appeal.",
