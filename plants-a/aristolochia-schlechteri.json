    "intro": "Aristolochia schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while the stems are hairy and woody. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and is also studied for its chemical compounds."
