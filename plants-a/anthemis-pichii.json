    "intro": "Anthemis pichii, commonly known as the Pichii's chamomile, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer, often with a faintly aromatic scent. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it typically grows in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
