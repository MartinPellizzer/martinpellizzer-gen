This subspecies is typically found in the mountainous regions of southern China, including areas such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian. It thrives in humid, subtropical climates with well-drained soils. The plant is commonly associated with secondary forests and mixed hardwood ecosystems. Its distribution is relatively localized, reflecting its specific ecological requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer amplum subsp. tientaiense was mainly introduced to regions with moist, temperate climates where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in areas with ample sunlight and moderate temperatures, making it suitable for cultivation in gardens and parks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental value, particularly its vibrant autumn foliage. It has been introduced to parts of eastern Asia, including China, where it has been cultivated for its aesthetic appeal. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
