    "intro": "Anagallis alba, commonly known as the white-flowered water primrose, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows in moist or wet environments such as marshes, stream banks, and ditches. The plant features opposite, oval-shaped leaves and produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom from spring to early summer. Its flowers are often accompanied by a distinctive, hairy, capsule-like structure that aids in seed dispersal. Anagallis alba is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
