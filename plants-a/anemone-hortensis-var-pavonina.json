    "intro": "Anemone hortensis var. pavonina, commonly known as the peacock anemone, is a deciduous perennial that features showy, double flowers in shades of pink, white, and red. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that emerge in early spring, often before the flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant touch to shaded garden spaces."
