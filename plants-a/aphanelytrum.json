    "intro": "Aphanelytrum, commonly known as the ghost grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted appearance and narrow, grass-like leaves. The flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, typical of many grass species. Aphanelytrum is native to various regions in Africa and is often found in dry, open habitats. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is not widely cultivated for agricultural or ornamental purposes."
