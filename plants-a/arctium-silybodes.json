    "intro": "Arctium silybodes, commonly known as greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces purple flowers arranged in a composite head, which are followed by spiky, woody burrs that aid in seed dispersal. Its roots are thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Arctium silybodes thrives in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in fields."
