    "intro": "Acer sieboldianum var. mandshuricum, commonly known as the Manchurian maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by samaras (winged seeds) for wind dispersal. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. The bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree can reach heights of up to 20 meters.",
