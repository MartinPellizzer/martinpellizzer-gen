    "intro": "Aegilops squarrosa subsp. strangulata, commonly known as the strangulate wild rye, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
