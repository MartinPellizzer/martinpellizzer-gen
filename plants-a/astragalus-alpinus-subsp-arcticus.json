    "intro": "Astragalus alpinus subsp. arcticus, commonly known as the Arctic milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and its leaves are typically trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Astragalus alpinus subsp. arcticus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats."
