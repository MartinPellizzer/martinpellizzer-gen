    "intro": "Athyrium schimperi, commonly known as the African lady fern, is a species of fern native to various regions in Africa. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common sight in humid, tropical climates. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in natural habitats."
