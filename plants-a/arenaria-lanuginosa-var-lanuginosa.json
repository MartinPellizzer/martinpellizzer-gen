    "intro": "Arenaria lanuginosa var. lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly sand-verbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to native pollinators."
