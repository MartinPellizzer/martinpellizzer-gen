    "intro": "Andromeda nikoensis, commonly known as the Niko's wintergreen, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late winter or early spring. Its leaves are aromatic, emitting a subtle mint-like scent when crushed, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Andromeda nikoensis is considered a vulnerable species."
