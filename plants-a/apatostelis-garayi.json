    "intro": "Apatostelis garayi, commonly known as the Garay's leafhopper, is a small insect belonging to the family Cicadellidae. It is characterized by its slender body and elongated wings, which are typically green or brown in color. This species is primarily found in the Andean regions of South America, where it inhabits grasslands and shrublands. The plant's botanical relevance lies in its role as a herbivorous insect that feeds on the sap of various flowering plants. Due to its specialized feeding habits, it plays a minor but ecologically significant role in the pollination and plant health dynamics of its native habitats."
