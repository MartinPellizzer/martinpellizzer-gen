    "intro": "Arabis canescens, commonly known as the hoary rockcress, is a flowering plant native to arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in rocky or sandy soils. Arabis canescens is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
