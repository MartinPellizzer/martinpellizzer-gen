It features striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink, red, or white, emerging from a cluster of strap-like leaves. The plant produces a cluster of flowers on a tall, erect stem, often blooming in late winter or early spring. Its bulbs are adapted to survive dry periods, making it resilient in arid environments. The leaves are fleshy and strap-like, contributing to its unique appearance."
