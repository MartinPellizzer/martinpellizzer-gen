It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects. Its botanical features make it well-suited for soil stabilization and as a forage crop."
