    "intro": "Acantholimon spirizianum, commonly known as the spiral-leaved stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial succulent with a rosette-forming growth habit, characterized by its fleshy, spiny leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and ornamental flowers make it a distinctive addition to alpine and desert landscapes.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon spirizianum is primarily native to Turkey. It is found in the eastern regions of the country, particularly in the Taurus Mountains. This plant thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and in open grasslands. It is adapted to the dry and harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific areas within Turkey, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon spirizianum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. It thrives in full sun and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. This plant is commonly associated with disturbed sites such as roadsides, construction areas, and open fields. It has a low-growing habit with narrow leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
