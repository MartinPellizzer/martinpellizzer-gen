    "intro": "Agrostis borealis var. recta, commonly known as the northern bentgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths that help stabilize soil in harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of tundra and mountain ecosystems."
