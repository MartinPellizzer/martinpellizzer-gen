    "intro": "Axonopus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf axonopus, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing foliage and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Axonopus latifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas. It is also used in some traditional medicinal practices due to its potential bioactive compounds."
