    "intro": "Anemone tridentata, commonly known as the three-lobed anemone, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of blue-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Anemone tridentata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems."
