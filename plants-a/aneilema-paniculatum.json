    "intro": "Aneilema paniculatum, commonly known as the African violet, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant is a member of the Gesneriaceae family and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The flowers typically bloom in clusters, forming a panicle inflorescence that adds to its aesthetic appeal."
