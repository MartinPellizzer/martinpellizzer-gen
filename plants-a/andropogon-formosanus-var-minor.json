    "intro": "Andropogon formosanus var. minor, commonly known as the lesser Chinese bluestem, is a perennial grass native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and wet meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green coloration, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in dense, compact arrangements. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense stands. This species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
