    "intro": "Auriculardisia sarapiquiensis, commonly known as the Guanacaste orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble ears, hence its genus name \"Auriculardisia.\" The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and drawing moisture and nutrients from the air. Its floral structure includes specialized petals and sepals that aid in pollination by specific insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
