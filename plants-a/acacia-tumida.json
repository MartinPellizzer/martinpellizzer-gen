    "intro": "Acacia tumida, commonly known as the woolly acacia, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, pale green foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisine. Its thick, waxy leaves help it conserve water, making it well adapted to arid environments. Acacia tumida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tumida is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these areas. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Its distribution is closely linked to the environmental conditions of the Australian outback.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tumida was mainly introduced to India. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the country. The plant is often used for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. It has been introduced for purposes such as afforestation and soil stabilization. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential ecological imbalances."
