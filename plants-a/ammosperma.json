    "intro": "Ammosperma, commonly known as the sand spurge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Ammosperma is adapted to survive in sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions due to its water-storing tissues."
