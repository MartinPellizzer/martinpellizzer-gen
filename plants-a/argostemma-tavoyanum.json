    "intro": "Argostemma tavoyanum, commonly known as the Tavoyan arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has a creeping rhizomatous stem that allows it to spread and form dense mats. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind."
