    "intro": "Anogeissus latifolia, commonly known as Indian sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The tree produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in dry deciduous forests. The plant is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oil."
