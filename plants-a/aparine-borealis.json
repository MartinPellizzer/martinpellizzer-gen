    "intro": "Aparine borealis, commonly known as the Arctic cleavers, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in cold, harsh environments, often found in tundra and rocky areas. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves and produces tiny white or pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Aparine borealis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small arctic organisms."
