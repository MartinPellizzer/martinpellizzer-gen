It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
