    "intro": "Astragalus chalaranthus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus chalaranthus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
