It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are narrow and sharply toothed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pinkish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
