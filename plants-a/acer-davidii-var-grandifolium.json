    "intro": "Acer davidii var. grandifolium, commonly known as the large-leaf maple, is a deciduous tree native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its distinctive palmately lobed leaves, which are typically large and have a vibrant green color during the growing season. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and parks for its aesthetic appeal.",
