    "intro": "Andromeda glauca, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and silvery-white underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Andromeda glauca thrives in acidic, moist soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a unique, hardy plant for shady areas."
