    "intro": "Armeria stellaria, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and its clusters of white or pink star-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in harsh coastal conditions. Armeria stellaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
