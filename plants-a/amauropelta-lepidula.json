    "intro": "Amauropelta lepidula, commonly known as the silver shield fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are covered in a dense layer of silvery, scale-like trichomes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to substrates, while its leaves are typically evergreen and remain throughout the year. The botanical features of Amauropelta lepidula make it a unique and visually striking member of the fern family."
