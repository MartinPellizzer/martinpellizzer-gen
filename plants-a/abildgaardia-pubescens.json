    "intro": "Abildgaardia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy abildgaardia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its flowers, which are usually violet or purple in color, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Abildgaardia pubescens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pubescens is primarily native to the southern regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. It is commonly found in dry grasslands and open woodlands with well-drained soils. This species thrives in temperate to subtropical climates and is adapted to seasonal droughts. It is often associated with rocky or sandy soils in these regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is not widely distributed beyond these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abildgaardia pubescens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of cultivation. However, it has since become invasive in certain areas, outcompeting native species for resources. The plant's rapid growth and ability to spread through vegetative reproduction have contributed to its success in the introduced environment. Efforts are being made to control its spread to protect local biodiversity."
