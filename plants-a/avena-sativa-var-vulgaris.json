    "intro": "Avena sativa var. vulgaris, commonly known as common oat, is a cultivated variety of the oat plant native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed flowers. The plant produces edible grains that are rich in nutrients, including fiber, protein, and various vitamins and minerals. Its growth habit is typically perennial, though it is often grown as an annual crop for agricultural purposes. The leaves are linear and grass-like, contributing to its overall appearance and ecological role in soil stabilization."
