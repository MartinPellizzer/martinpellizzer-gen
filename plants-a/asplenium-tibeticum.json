    "intro": "Asplenium tibeticum, commonly known as the Tibetan spleenwort, is a species of fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in crevices at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its spores are dispersed through the air, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its mountainous habitat. Asplenium tibeticum is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
