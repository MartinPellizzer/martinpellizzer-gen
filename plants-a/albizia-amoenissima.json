    "intro": "Albizia amoenissima, commonly known as the sweet acacia, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to southern Africa. It features pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in flat, pod-like fruits that split open when mature. Albizia amoenissima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
