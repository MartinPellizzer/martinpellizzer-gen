    "intro": "Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata, commonly known as the broad-leaved wood rose, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features dense, mat-forming growth with many small, woody stems. The leaves are compound, typically with 5\u20137 leaflets that are broad and ovate in shape. It produces showy yellow flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. This plant thrives in coastal and subalpine environments, often forming part of the native vegetation in these regions.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries, particularly in the southern parts. This plant thrives in open grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the variable climate of these regions, including seasonal droughts and cool winters. Its distribution is closely associated with the Andean foothills and surrounding plains.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena digitata var. latifoliolata was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. However, it has since become invasive, spreading rapidly in native ecosystems. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and can tolerate both full sun and partial shade. Its aggressive growth has led to the displacement of native vegetation in some regions."
