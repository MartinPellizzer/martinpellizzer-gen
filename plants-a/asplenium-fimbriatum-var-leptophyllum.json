    "intro": "Asplenium fimbriatum var. leptophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky surfaces. Its fronds are usually dark green, with a distinctive fimbriate (fringed) margin, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
