    "intro": "Asplenium erectum var. zeyheri, commonly known as the Zeyher's maidenhair fern, is a variant of the common maidenhair fern native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, dark green fronds that are typically upright or arching in growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature typical of ferns. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or wooded areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
