    "intro": "Aspidium totta, commonly known as the broad buckler fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its large, triangular to ovate-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, broad, and rounded appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests and along stream banks. Aspidium totta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its lush, fern-like foliage."
