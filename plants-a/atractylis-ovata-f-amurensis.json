It features a robust rhizomatous root system and produces upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant flowers in late summer, producing small, yellowish-green composite flowers that are clustered in loose panicles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along riverbanks. This fern-like plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native regions."
