    "intro": "Aloe trigona, commonly known as the finger aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems that are often branched and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers at the tips of its stems, which bloom in summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, storing water to help it survive in arid conditions. Aloe trigona is valued for its hardiness and is often used in landscaping and traditional medicine."
