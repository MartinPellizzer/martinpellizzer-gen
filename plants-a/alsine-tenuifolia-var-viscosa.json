    "intro": "Alsine tenuifolia var. viscosa, commonly known as sticky alsike, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs. The flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variety is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its sticky leaves and stems help deter herbivores and aid in seed dispersal."
