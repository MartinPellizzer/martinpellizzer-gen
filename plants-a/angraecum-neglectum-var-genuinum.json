It features elongated, dark green leaves and produces intricate, fragrant, white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments, often on trees or rocky surfaces. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
