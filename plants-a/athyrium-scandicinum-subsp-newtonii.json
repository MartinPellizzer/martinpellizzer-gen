    "intro": "Athyrium scandicinum subsp. newtonii, commonly known as the Newton's wood fern, is a perennial fern native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It features delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are typically bi- to tri-pinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are clustered in strobila. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shade gardens and conservation efforts."
