    "intro": "Aegilops triuncialis subsp. bozdagensis, commonly known as the Bozdag wild rye, is a perennial grass native to Turkey. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its genetic proximity to wheat, it is of interest in agricultural research for potential crop improvement."
