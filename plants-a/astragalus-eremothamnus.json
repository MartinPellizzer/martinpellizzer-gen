    "intro": "Astragalus eremothamnus, commonly known as the sand milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its low, spreading growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant has compound leaves with numerous small leaflets and produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to sandy and gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Astragalus eremothamnus plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
