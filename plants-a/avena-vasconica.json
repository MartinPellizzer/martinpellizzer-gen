    "intro": "Avena vasconica, commonly known as the Vasconian oat, is a perennial grass species native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle bearing small, two-lobed spikelets. Avena vasconica is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional agriculture."
