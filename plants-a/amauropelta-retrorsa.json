    "intro": "Amauropelta retrorsa, commonly known as the backward-pointing shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that curve backward, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. Its leaves are usually dark green and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps in moisture retention. Amauropelta retrorsa is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth."
