    "intro": "Asplenium speciosum, commonly known as the ornate spleenwort, is a species of fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic plant, typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. Its rhizomes are short and produce clusters of spore-bearing structures called sorus. Asplenium speciosum is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often cultivated in shaded, humid environments."
