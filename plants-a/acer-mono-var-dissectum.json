    "intro": "Acer mono var. dissectum, commonly known as the dissected maple, is a variant of the Japanese maple characterized by its finely cut, feathery leaves. It is native to Japan and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The plant produces small, red to orange flowers in early spring, followed by red or orange samaras in the fall. Its delicate foliage makes it a popular ornamental tree in gardens and landscapes. It requires partial shade to full sun and is relatively low maintenance once established.",
