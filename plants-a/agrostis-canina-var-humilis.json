    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. humilis, commonly known as the slender meadowgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping or as a ground cover. Due to its adaptability, it can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
