    "intro": "Acantholimon revolutum, commonly known as the curled sandthorn, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, often found in dry steppe and desert habitats. Due to its low-growing form and drought tolerance, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon revolutum is primarily native to Afghanistan. It is found in the mountainous regions of the country, particularly in the eastern and central areas. This plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. It is commonly associated with high-altitude grasslands and shrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in Afghanistan.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon revolutum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, often found in coastal and inland dunes. It is commonly established in disturbed sites such as roadsides, gravelly slopes, and sandy soils. This plant is typically found in regions with a Mediterranean climate, characterized by dry summers and wet winters. It has been reported in several states along the western United States, including California, Oregon, and Nevada. Due to its adaptability, it can spread rapidly in areas where it is not native."
