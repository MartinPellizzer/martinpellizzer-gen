    "intro": "Agrostis cinna, commonly known as common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, temperate regions and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Agrostis cinna is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its fine texture and resilience."
