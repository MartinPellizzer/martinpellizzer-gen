    "intro": "Alchemilla cartilaginea, commonly known as the stonecrop alchemilla, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in dry conditions. Alchemilla cartilaginea is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
