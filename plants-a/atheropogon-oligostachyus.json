    "intro": "Atheropogon oligostachyus, commonly known as the narrow-panicle grass, is a perennial grass species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
