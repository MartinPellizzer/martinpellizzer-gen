    "intro": "Aconitum legendrei, commonly known as the Legendre's monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided. Its roots are tuberous and contain toxic alkaloids, which make it potentially dangerous if ingested. Aconitum legendrei thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes.",
