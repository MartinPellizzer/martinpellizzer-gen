    "intro": "Acacia armitii, commonly known as the white wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, bipinnate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical spikes, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting native wildlife.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia armitii is primarily native to the Northern Territory and Queensland of Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This plant is often seen growing in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its native range. Acacia armitii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia armitii was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. It has since spread beyond cultivated areas and is now considered a potential weed in some regions. The plant is particularly invasive in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets can outcompete native vegetation. Management efforts are ongoing to control its spread and mitigate its impact on local ecosystems."
