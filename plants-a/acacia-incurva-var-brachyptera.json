    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia incurva var. brachyptera is primarily native to southern Australia, including parts of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is commonly found in dry, open habitats such as shrublands, woodlands, and rocky areas. This variety is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and provides habitat and food for various wildlife species. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern and western regions of the continent.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia incurva var. brachyptera was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, cleared land, and along watercourses. This plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has led to its establishment in several regions outside its native range. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
