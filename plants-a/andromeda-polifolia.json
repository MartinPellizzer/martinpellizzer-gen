    "intro": "Andromeda polifolia, commonly known as the cross-leaved andromeda, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often cross-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. Andromeda polifolia thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
