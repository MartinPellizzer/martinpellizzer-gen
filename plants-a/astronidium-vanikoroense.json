    "intro": "Astronidium vanikoroense, commonly known as the Vanikoro starling tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the island of Vanikoro in the Solomon Islands. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in coastal or lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
