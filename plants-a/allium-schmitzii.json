    "intro": "Allium schmitzii, commonly known as Schmitz's onion, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, grass-like, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Allium schmitzii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
