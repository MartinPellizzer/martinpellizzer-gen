    "intro": "Astronidium pseudoparviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered astronidium, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its evergreen nature and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round berries. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
