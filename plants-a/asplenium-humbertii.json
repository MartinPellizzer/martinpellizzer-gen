    "intro": "Asplenium humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium humbertii is a relatively rare species, with a limited geographic distribution primarily in Southeast Asia."
