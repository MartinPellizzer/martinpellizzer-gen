    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abuta ecuadorensis is primarily native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It is found in the mountainous areas of the country, particularly in the western and central highlands. This plant thrives in humid, temperate climates at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters above sea level. It is commonly found in cloud forests and secondary growth habitats. Its native distribution is limited to Ecuador, where it grows in the wild in specific ecological niches.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abuta ecuadorensis was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, typically found in tropical and subtropical areas. It thrives in areas with moderate to high rainfall and partial to full sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and unique flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in South America and parts of Southeast Asia. However, its spread is limited by its specific environmental requirements and the need for careful cultivation."
