    "intro": "Androsace villosa f. globiferoides, commonly known as the woolly androsace, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with hairy, silver-gray leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are arranged in umbel-like inflorescences. Its succulent stems and leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. This cultivar is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine gardens for its ornamental value and hardiness."
