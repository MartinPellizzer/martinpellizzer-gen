    "intro": "Anthericum sulphureum, commonly known as the sulfur yellow rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features tall, slender stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on slender, branching inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in wet or moist soils. The species is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
