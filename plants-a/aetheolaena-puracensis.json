    "intro": "Aetheolaena puracensis, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Peru, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
