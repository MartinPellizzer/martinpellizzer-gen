    "intro": "Asplenium lunulatum var. camptorachis, commonly known as the bent-veined maidenhair fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that have a distinctive, zigzag pattern along the veins. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
