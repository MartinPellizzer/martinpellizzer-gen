    "intro": "Athyrium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved fern, is a species of fern native to eastern Asia. It features feather-like fronds that are dark green and glossy, with a distinctive, elegant appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce new shoots, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Athyrium latifolium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
