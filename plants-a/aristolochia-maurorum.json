    "intro": "Aristolochia maurorum, commonly known as the Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, hood-shaped flowers that resemble a pipe, with a deep purple to greenish coloration. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but have a strong, unpleasant taste. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal uses, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
