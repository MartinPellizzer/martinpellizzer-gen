    "intro": "Alchemilla breviloba, commonly known as narrowleaf lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Alchemilla breviloba is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet conditions."
