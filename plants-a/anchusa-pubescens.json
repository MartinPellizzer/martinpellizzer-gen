    "intro": "Anchusa pubescens, commonly known as the hairy verbena, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in coastal areas. The plant produces showy clusters of blue to violet flowers, which bloom in summer. Its hairy, grayish leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Anchusa pubescens is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
