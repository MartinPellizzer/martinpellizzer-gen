    "intro": "Allium glaciale, commonly known as the glacier garlic, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the high altitudes of Europe and Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, making them a valuable addition to culinary traditions. Allium glaciale is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom in harsh environments."
