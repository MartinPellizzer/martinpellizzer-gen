    "intro": "Astragalus dealbatus, commonly known as the white milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces pods that contain small, round seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Astragalus dealbatus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and support local wildlife."
