    "intro": "Asplenium moritzianum, commonly known as the Moritz's spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, tufted growth habit and features dark green, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Asplenium moritzianum is a hardy species that thrives in temperate climates and is often found in montane regions."
