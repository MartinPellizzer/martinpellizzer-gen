It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system, allowing it to spread slowly across moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lanceolate or elliptic in shape, with a serrated or toothed margin. This species is often found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees in humid, temperate regions."
