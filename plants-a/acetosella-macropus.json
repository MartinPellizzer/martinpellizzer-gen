    "intro": "Acetosella macropus, commonly known as the large-leaved sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. Acetosella macropus is also known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content.",
