It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and slender stems. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are usually white or pale green. Alectra sessiliflora is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
