    "intro": "Anthoxanthum puelii var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming grass native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments where it helps stabilize sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its unique ecological role and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
