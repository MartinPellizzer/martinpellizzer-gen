    "intro": "Astragalus psilacanthus subsp. psilacanthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
