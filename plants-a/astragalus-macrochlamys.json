It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
