    "intro": "Atriplex patula proles littoralis, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It has succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water and reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It is often found in salt marshes, dunes, and other coastal habitats where it stabilizes soil and prevents erosion. Its ability to thrive in high-salinity soils makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
