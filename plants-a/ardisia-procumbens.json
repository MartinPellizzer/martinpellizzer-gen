It features glossy, dark green leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover in woodland gardens."
