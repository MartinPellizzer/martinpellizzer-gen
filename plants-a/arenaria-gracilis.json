    "intro": "Arenaria gracilis, commonly known as slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, succulent leaves and produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its narrow, grass-like leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Arenaria gracilis plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats."
