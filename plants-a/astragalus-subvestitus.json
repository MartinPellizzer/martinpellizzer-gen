It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Astragalus subvestitus plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
