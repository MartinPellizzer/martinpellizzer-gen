It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves with distinctive white spots. The plant produces an inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. Its flowers are usually green or white, with a central spadix that bears both male and female flowers. Arum punctulatum is often cultivated for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings."
