    "intro": "Alnus februaria, commonly known as the flowering alder, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that appear early in the spring, often before the leaves emerge. The tree has smooth, gray bark and opposite, simple leaves that turn yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near streams or in wetlands. Alnus februaria plays an important role in ecological systems by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plant life."
