    "intro": "Aristolochia sempervirens subsp. altissima, commonly known as the Virginia snakeroot, is a climbing vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, dark green leaves and distinctive, maroon-colored, pipe-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-white fruits that contain seeds dispersed by birds. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, shady habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in herbal remedies, though its use is now limited due to toxicity concerns."
