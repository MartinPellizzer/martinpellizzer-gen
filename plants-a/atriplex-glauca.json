    "intro": "Atriplex glauca, commonly known as saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its small, blue-green leaves that are coated with a waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is highly salt-tolerant and thrives in soils with high salinity, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Atriplex glauca is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
