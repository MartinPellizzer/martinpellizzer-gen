    "intro": "Aira anomala, commonly known as the slender false panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often forming dense clumps near water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are dispersed by water or wind. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
