It is characterized by its unique, spiky foliage and a distinctive, often irregular crown shape. The leaves are typically scale-like and tightly packed, giving the tree a dense, angular appearance. Araucaria species are known for their longevity and can live for hundreds of years. They play an important role in their native ecosystems and are often found in mountainous regions."
