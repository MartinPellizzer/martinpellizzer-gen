It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hooded flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are used in traditional Chinese medicine for their purported medicinal properties. However, it contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic and can cause severe health issues."
