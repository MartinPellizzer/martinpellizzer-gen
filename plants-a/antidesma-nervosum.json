    "intro": "Antidesma nervosum, commonly known as the African starfruit or black starfruit, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often glandular-stipulate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cupular inflorescences, followed by fleshy, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange when ripe. The fruit is edible, with a sweet and acidic flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in local cuisines. It also has traditional medicinal uses in some African communities."
