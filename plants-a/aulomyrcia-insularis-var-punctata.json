    "intro": "Aulomyrcia insularis var. punctata, commonly known as the speckled island hibiscus, is a rare flowering plant native to specific island environments. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a silvery or white speckled pattern on the upper surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
