    "intro": "Allium scopulicola, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant produces small, bulbous structures that resemble garlic cloves, which are used for propagation. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, while its flowers are small, white or pale purple, arranged in a loose cluster. Allium scopulicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
