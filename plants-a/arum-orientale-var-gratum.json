It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a glossy texture. The plant produces a spadix, a dense cluster of tiny flowers surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variety is known for its ability to tolerate a range of soil types and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
