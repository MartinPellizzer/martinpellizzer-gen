    "intro": "Arabis arenosa var. suecica, commonly known as the Swedish rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its compact rosette of hairy, blue-green leaves and small white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. It is drought-tolerant and well-adapted to harsh, rocky conditions. Its foliage and flowers are often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
