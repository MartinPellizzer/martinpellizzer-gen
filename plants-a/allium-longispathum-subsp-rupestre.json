    "intro": "Allium longispathum subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rock garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are typically linear to lanceolate, with a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The plant produces umbel-like inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. The species is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
