    "intro": "Allocarya tuberculata, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows from 30 to 100 centimeters tall and thrives in well-drained soils. Its fibrous roots help it survive in harsh, dry environments. Allocarya tuberculata is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
