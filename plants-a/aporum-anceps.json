    "intro": "Aporum anceps, commonly known as the narrow-leafed aporum, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of South America. It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant features slender, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters wide. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Aporum anceps is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
