    "intro": "Acacia myrtifolia var. major, commonly known as the large-leaved wattle, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which bloom in spring and attract a variety of pollinators. Its bark is typically smooth and greyish, and it can grow in a range of soil types, though it prefers well-drained conditions. The species is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia myrtifolia var. major is primarily native to northern Australia, including parts of Queensland, Northern Territory, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly in sandy soils. This variant is often associated with mulga woodlands and dry open forests. It thrives in regions with low rainfall and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia myrtifolia var. major was mainly introduced to South Africa, where it has become naturalized in certain regions. It is commonly found in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, thriving in coastal and semi-arid environments. This plant is often associated with disturbed soils and has been reported in agricultural areas and along roadsides. Its introduction is believed to have occurred through seed dispersal by birds or through human activity. However, its ecological impact remains under study due to its potential invasiveness in native ecosystems."
