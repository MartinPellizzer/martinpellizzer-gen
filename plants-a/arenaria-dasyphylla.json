    "intro": "Arenaria dasyphylla, commonly known as the tufted sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white or pink. The plant has tiny, needle-like leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Arenaria dasyphylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
