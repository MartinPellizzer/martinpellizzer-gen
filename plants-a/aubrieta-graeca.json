    "intro": "Aubrieta graeca, commonly known as Greek aubrieta, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Aubrieta graeca is valued for its hardiness and ability to bloom repeatedly throughout the growing season."
