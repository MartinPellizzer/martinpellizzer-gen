    "intro": "Androsace tibetica var. mariae, commonly known as the Tibetan mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
