    "intro": "Acacia oerfota var. nubica, commonly known as the Nubian acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant has phyllodes, which are modified leaf stalks that function as leaves, reducing water loss in dry environments. It produces yellow to orange flowers, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Acacia oerfota var. nubica is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and can thrive with minimal water.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia oerfota var. nubica is primarily native to the Horn of Africa, including countries such as Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. This variant is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in rocky soils and dry landscapes. It is often associated with coastal and mountainous areas, where it forms part of the local vegetation. The plant is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia oerfota var. nubica was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The plant is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing properties, which improve soil fertility. It has been introduced in several countries across Africa and the Middle East. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts on native flora."
