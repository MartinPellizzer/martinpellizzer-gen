    "intro": "Agrostis nigra, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, low-lying areas such as meadows, marshes, and riverbanks. The plant has slender, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed soils. Agrostis nigra is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
