    "intro": "Acaciella tequilana var. tequilana, commonly known as the Mexican honey mesquite, is a shrub or small tree native to Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually bipinnate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by flat, pod-like fruits. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to hot, dry climates. This species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of nectar for bees.",

This plant is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of these areas. It thrives in limestone soils and is often associated with desert ecosystems. The species is well adapted to the harsh climate conditions of its native range. It is an important component of the local flora in these regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaciella tequilana var. tequilana was mainly introduced to regions with a warm, dry climate, particularly in southern Mexico and parts of Central America. It thrives in well-drained soils and is commonly found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. This plant is often used for soil stabilization due to its deep root system and ability to tolerate drought conditions. It has also been introduced to other parts of the world for ornamental purposes. However, its spread is limited by its specific climatic requirements and soil preferences."
