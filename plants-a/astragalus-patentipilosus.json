It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces oval, leathery pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Astragalus patentipilosus is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
