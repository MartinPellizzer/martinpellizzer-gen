    "intro": "Ambrosia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf ragweed, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters and has slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are wind-pollinated, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture. Ambrosia pusilla is known for its allergenic properties due to the pollen it releases. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and other open areas."
