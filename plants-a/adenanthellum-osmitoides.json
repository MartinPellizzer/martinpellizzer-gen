    "intro": "Adenanthellum osmitoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant has small, narrow leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is well adapted to dry environments, with mechanisms to store water and reduce transpiration. Its botanical features make it a resilient and visually striking component of desert flora.",
