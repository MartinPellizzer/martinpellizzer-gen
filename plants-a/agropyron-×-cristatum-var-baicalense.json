    "intro": "Agropyron \u00d7 cristatum var. baicalense, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
