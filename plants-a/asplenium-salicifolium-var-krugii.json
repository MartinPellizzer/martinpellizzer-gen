    "intro": "Asplenium salicifolium var. krugii, commonly known as Krug's sedge fern, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along streams, where it can thrive in the partial shade and high humidity. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a smooth margin, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its fronds. This variant is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
