    "intro": "Anthurium titanium, commonly known as the white anthurium, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped leaves that are often a vibrant green with a waxy texture. The plant produces elegant, spatulate-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a prominent spadix. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistently moist, well-draining soil. Anthurium titanium is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
