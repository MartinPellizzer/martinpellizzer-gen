    "intro": "Anisantha rigens, commonly known as the rigid hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Anisantha rigens is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small vertebrates."
