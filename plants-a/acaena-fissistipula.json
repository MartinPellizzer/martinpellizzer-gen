    "intro": "Acaena fissistipula, commonly known as the New Zealand thistle, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant produces achene fruits that are often covered in hooked bristles, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animals. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including coastal areas and dry forests, and is adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena fissistipula is primarily native to the southern regions of New Zealand. It is commonly found in the South Island, particularly in areas with dry, open vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands. This plant thrives in coastal and inland environments with well-drained soils. It is an important component of the local flora and is often found in association with other native shrubs and herbs. Its distribution is largely limited to the southern parts of the country due to its specific environmental requirements.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena fissistipula was mainly introduced to New Zealand as a ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and potential for erosion control. It was first recorded in the 19th century and has since spread throughout various regions of the country. The plant thrives in a range of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. It has become naturalized in many areas, often invading native habitats and outcompeting indigenous species. Due to its invasive nature, it is now considered a weed of concern in several parts of New Zealand."
