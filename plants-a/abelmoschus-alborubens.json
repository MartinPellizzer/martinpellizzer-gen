    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abelmoschus alborubens is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Thailand, and Malaysia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible pods. It is also known as the red okra or Chinese okra due to its distinctive red flowers and fruit. Its native distribution is closely associated with the Indian subcontinent and neighboring tropical regions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus alborubens was mainly introduced to South America through human activity, particularly as a result of agricultural expansion and trade. It is commonly found in regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, such as parts of Brazil and Argentina. The plant has adapted well to these environments, often growing along roadsides and in disturbed areas. Its introduction has led to its naturalization in several regions, where it now competes with native flora. Despite its invasive tendencies, it is also cultivated for its ornamental value and edible seeds."
