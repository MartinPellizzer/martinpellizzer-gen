It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-adapted to harsh environmental conditions. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of tiny, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and dunes, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
