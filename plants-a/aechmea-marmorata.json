    "intro": "Aechmea marmorata, commonly known as the Marble Aechmea, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central tank to collect water. The leaves are typically gray-green with white or silver markings, giving it a striking appearance. It produces vibrant orange or red flowers that bloom from the center of the rosette. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
