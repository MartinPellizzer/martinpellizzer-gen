    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hairgrass, is a low-growing grass species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-green blades that form dense, mat-like growths, often thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous, with flowers that are adapted to wind pollination. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in arid or semi-arid landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal plantings."
