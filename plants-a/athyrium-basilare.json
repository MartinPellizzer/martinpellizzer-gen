    "intro": "Athyrium basilare, commonly known as the broad-leaf mottled shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often mottled with dark green and lighter green patterns. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with small, closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, lush appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or along stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are perennial, allowing it to spread and form colonies over time."
