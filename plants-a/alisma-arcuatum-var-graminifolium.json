    "intro": "Alisma arcuatum var. graminifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette, with a smooth, waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in late summer, which are clustered in spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense colonies that help stabilize shoreline ecosystems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it an important species in wetland restoration projects."
