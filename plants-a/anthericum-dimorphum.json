    "intro": "Anthericum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a distinctive inflorescence composed of a spadix surrounded by a spathe, typical of the Araceae family. The plant has two morphologically different leaves: a basal, broad leaf and an upper, narrow leaf, giving it its common name. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and it relies on insects for pollination. Anthericum dimorphum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
