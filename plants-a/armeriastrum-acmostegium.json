    "intro": "Armeriastrum acmostegium, commonly known as silverleaf filaree, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with woolly, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a dense covering of fine hairs. Armeriastrum acmostegium is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, making it well adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
