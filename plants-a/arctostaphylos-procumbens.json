    "intro": "Arctostaphylos procumbens, commonly known as creeping manzanita, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to dry, sunny environments and it is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
