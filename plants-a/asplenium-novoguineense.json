    "intro": "Asplenium novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, tropical environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often clustered together, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Asplenium novoguineense is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including New Guinea, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist conditions."
