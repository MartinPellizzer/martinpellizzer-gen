    "intro": "Aldina stergiosii, commonly known as the Greek Aldina, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in limestone-rich habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
