    "intro": "Antennaria nardina, commonly known as the nodding whitlow grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its flowers are typically nodding, which helps protect them from strong winds and excessive sunlight. Antennaria nardina is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
