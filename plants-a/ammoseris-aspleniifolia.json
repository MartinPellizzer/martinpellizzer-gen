The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its fronds are often described as resembling those of the genus Asplenium, hence its specific epithet. Ammoseris aspleniifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
