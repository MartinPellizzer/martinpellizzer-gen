    "intro": "Astragalus niveus, commonly known as the snow vetcher, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has palmate leaves composed of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. Astragalus niveus is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
