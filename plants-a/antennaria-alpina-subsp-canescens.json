    "intro": "Antennaria alpina subsp. canescens, commonly known as the Alpine hairpin, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its grayish, fuzzy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in harsh, high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and tundra. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common component of alpine plant communities and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
