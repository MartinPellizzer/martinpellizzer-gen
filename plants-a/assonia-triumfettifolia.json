    "intro": "Assonia triumfettifolia, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It features palm-like leaves that are compound and often have a striking golden or yellow hue. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Assonia triumfettifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
