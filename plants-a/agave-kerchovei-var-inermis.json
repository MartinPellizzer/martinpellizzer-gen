It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, bluish-gray leaves that are spineless, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact size and ornamental leaves make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
