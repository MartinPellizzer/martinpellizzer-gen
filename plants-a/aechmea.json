    "intro": "Aechmea, commonly known as the pineapple bromeliad, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Aechmea species are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, often found in rainforests. The flowers, which are usually small and clustered, are followed by showy bracts that can last for several months."
