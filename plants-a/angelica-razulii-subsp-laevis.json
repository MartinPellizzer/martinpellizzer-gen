    "intro": "Angelica razulii subsp. laevis, commonly known as the smooth angelica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are smooth and often have a distinctive silvery underside. Its flowers, which appear in late summer, are small and clustered in umbels, giving it a subtle, aromatic fragrance. The roots of this subspecies are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties."
