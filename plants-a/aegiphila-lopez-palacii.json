    "intro": "Aegiphila lopez-palacii, commonly known as the Lopez-Palaci fern, is a rare shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a silvery underside, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of purple or pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
