    "intro": "Augustia caffra, commonly known as the Cape rose or Cape honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in spring and summer. Augustia caffra is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
