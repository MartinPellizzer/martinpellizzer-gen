    "intro": "Albizia zericocephala, commonly known as the white siris, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in racemes, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous pod, and the tree is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in agroforestry systems. Albizia zericocephala is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
