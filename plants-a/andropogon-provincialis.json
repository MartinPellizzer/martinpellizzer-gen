    "intro": "Andropogon provincialis, commonly known as the tallgrass bluestem, is a native perennial grass found in the central and eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands, prairies, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to six feet. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant. It is often used in restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
