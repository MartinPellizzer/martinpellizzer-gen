    "intro": "Althaea olbia, commonly known as the Persian marshmallow, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots are rich in mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties. Althaea olbia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
