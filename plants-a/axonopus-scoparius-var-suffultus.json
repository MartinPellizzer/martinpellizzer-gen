    "intro": "Axonopus scoparius var. suffultus, commonly known as the hairy axonopus, is a low-growing, perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features fine, wiry leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically inconspicuous. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of water bodies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, forming dense mats that can stabilize soil. Botanically, it is characterized by its hairy nodes and leaves, which contribute to its common name."
