It is characterized by its large, showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant has a woody stem and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Alsinopsis macrocarpa is well-suited to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
