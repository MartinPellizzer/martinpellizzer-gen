    "intro": "Ajuga vulgaris, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Ajuga vulgaris thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to suppress weeds in garden settings."
