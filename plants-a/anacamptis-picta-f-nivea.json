    "intro": "Anacamptis picta f. nivea, commonly known as the Snowy Orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features a compact, upright growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its flowers are typically arranged in a loose raceme, and it thrives in cool, moist habitats. This variety is distinguished by its pale coloration, which sets it apart from the more vibrant flowers of the typical *Anacamptis picta*."
