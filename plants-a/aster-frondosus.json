    "intro": "Aster frondosus, commonly known as the fronded aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble fern fronds, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flower heads in the late summer and early fall. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded to partially shaded areas. Aster frondosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
