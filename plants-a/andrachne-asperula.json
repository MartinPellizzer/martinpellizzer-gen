    "intro": "Andrachne asperula, commonly known as rough sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to anchor it in sandy or rocky soils. Andrachne asperula is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and gravelly slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
