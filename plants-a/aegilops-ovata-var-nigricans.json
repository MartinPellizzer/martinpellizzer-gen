    "intro": "Aegilops ovata var. nigricans, commonly known as the black rye or black wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, glumes that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with awned lemmas, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as steppes and grasslands. This species is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers due to its potential genetic contributions to wheat improvement."
