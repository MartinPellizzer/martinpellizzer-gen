    "intro": "Abronia nana var. covillei, commonly known as the Coville's dwarf sandverbena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of pale blue to violet flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia nana var. covillei is primarily native to California and Nevada. This plant is found in the western United States, specifically in these two states. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open habitats. The species is part of the Geraniaceae family and is known for its small, clustered flowers. Its limited distribution reflects its adaptation to specific ecological conditions in the region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia nana var. covillei was mainly introduced to the western United States, particularly in California and Oregon. It was brought there for ornamental purposes due to its attractive, small, blue flowers. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. However, it has become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential ecological impact."
