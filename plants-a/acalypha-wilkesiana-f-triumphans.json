It is characterized by its striking, papery bracts that resemble small lanterns, which are typically red, orange, or yellow in color. The plant has palmate leaves with a soft, velvety texture and emits a mild, sweet fragrance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant foliage.
