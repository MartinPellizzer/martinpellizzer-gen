    "intro": "Arabis puberula, commonly known as the hairy rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbage and mustard. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, white flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces rounded, seed-containing pods that split open when mature. Arabis puberula is often found in alpine and coastal regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions."
