    "intro": "Attalea insignis, commonly known as the Amazonian palm or the Brazil nut tree, is a tall, slender palm native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, feather-like leaves and produces clustered, woody fruits that contain the edible Brazil nuts. The plant's trunk is typically unbranched and covered in a fibrous sheath that sheds as it grows. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species. The plant's unique structure and ecological importance make it a significant component of the rainforest biodiversity."
