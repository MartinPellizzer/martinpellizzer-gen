    "intro": "Anthurium arandae, commonly known as the red anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped spathes that range from deep red to orange, often with a contrasting green or white spathe. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are borne on a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. Its glossy, dark green leaves are elongated and have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Anthurium arandae thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
