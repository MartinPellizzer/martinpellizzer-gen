It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize open areas effectively. Allosorus consobrinus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and dry slopes."
