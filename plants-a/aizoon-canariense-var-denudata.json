    "intro": "Aizoon canariense var. denudata, commonly known as the Canary Island spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its stems are often branched and can become woody with age, providing structural support. This variant is adapted to coastal and rocky environments, showcasing resilience to salt spray and strong winds."
