    "intro": "Abrus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered devil's claw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and China. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces pods that contain seeds with a striking red, kidney-shaped body covered in a toxic, sticky substance. These seeds are used in traditional medicine and as a natural insecticide due to their toxic properties. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abrus pauciflorus is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This plant thrives in humid climates and is often associated with secondary forests and disturbed habitats. It is also present in parts of India and Sri Lanka, where it grows in similar environmental conditions. Due to its adaptability, it can occasionally be found in cultivated areas near its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus pauciflorus was mainly introduced to areas with disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides, waste lands, and agricultural fields. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions where it can establish itself quickly due to its adaptability. The plant spreads primarily through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, animals, or water. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions because of its rapid growth and competitive nature. However, in its native range, it plays an important ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
