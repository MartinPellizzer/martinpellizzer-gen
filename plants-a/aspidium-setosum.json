    "intro": "Aspidium setosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit with fronds that are pinnately compound and often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction. The plant's structure and growth pattern make it well adapted to its humid, low-light habitat."
