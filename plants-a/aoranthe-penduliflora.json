    "intro": "Aoranthe penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, fragrant orchid flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a rosette pattern. Aoranthe penduliflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
