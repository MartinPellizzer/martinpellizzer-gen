    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum subsp. albescens is primarily native to the Nansei-shoto, Northern Territory, Queensland, Sulawesi, and Western Australia. This species is commonly found in coastal and tropical regions across these areas. It thrives in sandy soils and is often associated with coastal dunes and scrublands. The plant is well adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal environments and providing habitat for local wildlife.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon indicum subsp. albescens was mainly introduced to Gilbert Is., Line Is., Marianas, Tokelau-Manihiki, Tuamotu, and Wake I. It is a non-native species that has established populations in these remote island regions. The introduction likely occurred through human activity, such as shipping or intentional planting. It thrives in coastal and disturbed habitats, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its presence in these areas raises concerns about its impact on local ecosystems and biodiversity."
