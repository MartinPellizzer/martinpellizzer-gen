    "intro": "Aspidium obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved water fern, is a perennial fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, oblong, and leathery fronds that are typically 30\u201360 cm in length. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Aspidium obtusifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
