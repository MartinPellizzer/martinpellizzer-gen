    "intro": "Astracantha hilariae, commonly known as the Hilaria thistle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has spiny, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, appearing in dense clusters, and it produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Astracantha hilariae is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
