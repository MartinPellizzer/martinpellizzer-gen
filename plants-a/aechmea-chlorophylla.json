    "intro": "Aechmea chlorophylla, commonly known as the silver pine bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant's foliage is covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which give it its distinctive silvery appearance and aid in water retention. It produces striking red or orange flower bracts that emerge from the leaf rosette, often followed by small, white flowers. Aechmea chlorophylla thrives in bright, indirect light and requires high humidity and well-draining soil to flourish."
