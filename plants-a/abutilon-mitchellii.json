    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon mitchellii is primarily native to Queensland and Western Australia. It is commonly found in arid and semi-arid regions within these states. This plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in open woodlands or shrublands. It is well adapted to the dry climate and can thrive with minimal water. Its distribution is largely restricted to the specific ecological zones of Queensland and Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon mitchellii was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-like flowers and its ability to thrive in various climates. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in southern states such as Texas, California, and Florida. This plant has also been reported in some regions of Hawaii and parts of the Pacific Islands where it has become naturalized. Its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to spread into native ecosystems. Despite its ornamental value, its invasive tendencies require careful management in certain areas."
