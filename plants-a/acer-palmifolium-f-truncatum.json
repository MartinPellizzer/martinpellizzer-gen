The leaves are palmately lobed, with a truncate (cut-off) tip, giving it a unique appearance compared to typical maple leaves. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage. The tree typically grows to a moderate height and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring.",
