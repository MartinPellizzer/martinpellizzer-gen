    "intro": "Arundo littorea var. major, commonly known as the giant reed, is a tall, perennial grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth and long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces feathery, plume-like inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in wet or marshy environments and is often found along riverbanks and coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become invasive in non-native habitats."
