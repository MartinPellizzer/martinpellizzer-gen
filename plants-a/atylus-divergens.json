    "intro": "Atylus divergens, commonly known as the divergent lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Lecanoraceae. It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in various environmental conditions. It is often found on rock surfaces in temperate and subarctic regions. Atylus divergens is known for its slow growth and ability to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments."
