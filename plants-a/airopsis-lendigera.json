    "intro": "Airopsis lendigera, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Goodeniaceae. It is native to southern Africa and thrives in coastal environments, often growing on rocky shores and sandy beaches. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in saline conditions. Airopsis lendigera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
