    "intro": "Asclepias ovalifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces distinctive seed pods that contain numerous hairy, white seeds attached to silky filaments, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open woodlands. Asclepias ovalifolia is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and plays a vital role in local ecosystems."
