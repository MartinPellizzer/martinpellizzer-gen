    "intro": "Asplenium abrotanoides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, evergreen fern native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often on cliffs or walls, and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and covered in fine hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Asplenium abrotanoides is a hardy plant that is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, shady areas."
