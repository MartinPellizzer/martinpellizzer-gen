    "intro": "Arabis besseri subsp. proseocarpatica, commonly known as the alpine rockcress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features basal rosettes of linear, glaucous leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of these harsh habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and fragile species."
