    "intro": "Alternanthera filifolia subsp. filifolia, commonly known as the threadleaf Alternanthera, is a herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under bright light. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are typically green or yellow. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage rather than its flowers."
