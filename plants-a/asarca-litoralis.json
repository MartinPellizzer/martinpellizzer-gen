    "intro": "Asarca litoralis, commonly known as the seaside bluemouth, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, thriving in saline environments. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in umbels, a common feature in the carrot family. Asarca litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various small invertebrates."
