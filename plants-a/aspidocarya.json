    "intro": "Aspidocarya, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that often form a rosette shape, allowing them to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Aspidocarya species typically have finely divided, needle-like fronds that help in maximizing light absorption while floating on the water's surface. They are often found in ponds, ditches, and other shallow water bodies, contributing to water clarity by filtering debris. Due to their delicate structure, they are sensitive to water pollution and serve as indicators of water quality."
