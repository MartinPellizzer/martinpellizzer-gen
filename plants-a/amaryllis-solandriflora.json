It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of white or pale pink, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained sandy soils and is adapted to withstand saline and windy conditions. It is often found growing in dunes and coastal grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Due to its unique habitat and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
