    "intro": "Astragalus crotalariae var. magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalen's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils, where it adapts to harsh conditions. Its root system is deep, allowing it to access water from lower soil layers, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
