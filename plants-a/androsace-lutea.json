    "intro": "Androsace lutea, commonly known as the yellow sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, grass-like leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine, white hairs that provide protection against intense sunlight and cold. Androsace lutea is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to high-altitude conditions."
