    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. setulosa, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, bluish-green leaves that are often covered with short, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers, typically appearing in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in ecological restoration projects."
