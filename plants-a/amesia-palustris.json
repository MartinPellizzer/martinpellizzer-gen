    "intro": "Amesia palustris, commonly known as marsh amesia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. Amesia palustris plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
