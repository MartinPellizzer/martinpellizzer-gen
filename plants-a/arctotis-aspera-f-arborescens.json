    "intro": "Arctotis aspera f. arborescens, commonly known as the tree arctotis, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to South Africa. It features dense, rounded foliage with a mat-forming growth habit, and its leaves are typically gray-green with a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It is well-suited for rock gardens, containers, and as a border plant due to its compact size and ornamental value. This variety is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a versatile choice for Mediterranean climates."
