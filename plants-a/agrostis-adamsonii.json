    "intro": "Agrostis adamsonii, commonly known as Adamson's bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis adamsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
