It features a basal rosette of broad, flat, grass-like leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem topped with a dense cluster of small, pinkish to purple flowers. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, often used in traditional cuisines. The plant is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
