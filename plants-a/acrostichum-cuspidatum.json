It is characterized by its long, sword-shaped fronds that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are typically bright green and have a leathery texture. Acrostichum cuspidatum thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands and along stream banks.",
