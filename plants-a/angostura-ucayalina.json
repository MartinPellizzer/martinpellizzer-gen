    "intro": "Angostura ucayalina, commonly known as the Amazonian angostura, is a species of flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. Its leaves are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its fruit is a small, round capsule containing several seeds. Due to its habitat in remote areas, it remains relatively understudied, though it holds potential for ecological and pharmacological research."
