    "intro": "Arenaria taibaishanensis, commonly known as the Taibaishan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
