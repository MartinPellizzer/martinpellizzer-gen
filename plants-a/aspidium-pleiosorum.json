    "intro": "Aspidium pleiosorum, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its large, broad, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate, giving it a complex, feathery appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive pattern. Aspidium pleiosorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
