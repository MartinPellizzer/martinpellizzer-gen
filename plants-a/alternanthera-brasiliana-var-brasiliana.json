    "intro": "Alternanthera brasiliana var. brasiliana, commonly known as the red flame plant, is a vibrant aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking red, pink, or orange-colored foliage, which becomes more intense under strong lighting conditions. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with elongated, narrow leaves that provide excellent visual appeal in aquariums or water gardens. It thrives in warm, moderately soft water with good circulation and requires regular pruning to maintain its compact shape. This species is popular among aquarists for its ornamental value and ease of care."
