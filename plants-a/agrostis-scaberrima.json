    "intro": "Agrostis scaberrima, commonly known as the rough bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (tufted) growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small, cylindrical flower clusters. Agrostis scaberrima is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
