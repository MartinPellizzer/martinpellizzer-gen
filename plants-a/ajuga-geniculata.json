    "intro": "Ajuga geniculata, commonly known as carpet bugle or bugleweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomatous roots that allow it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, tubular blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. Ajuga geniculata is valued for its ability to thrive in shaded areas and its use in erosion control and ground cover."
