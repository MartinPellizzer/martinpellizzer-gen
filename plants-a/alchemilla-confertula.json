    "intro": "Alchemilla confertula, commonly known as the clustered lady\u2019s mantle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silver-white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, upright stems. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported healing properties. Alchemilla confertula thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
