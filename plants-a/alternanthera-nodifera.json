    "intro": "Alternanthera nodifera, commonly known as the red-veined stinkweed, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that often display striking red or purple veins. The plant produces small, inconspicuous green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by three-winged, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in many areas outside its native range."
