    "intro": "Acer \u00d7 rotundilobum, commonly known as the red maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Acer rubrum (red maple) and Acer saccharum (sugar maple). The tree is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves that are often lobed and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in forest ecosystems.",
