    "intro": "Acalypha crenata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular acalypha, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with serrated margins and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or pink. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, glandular substance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses.",

It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in lowland areas with moist, well-drained soils. This variant is often associated with rainforests and secondary growth habitats. It thrives in humid climates and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its native distribution includes parts of Oceania as well.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha crenata var. glandulosa was mainly introduced to Hawaii. It was introduced as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. The plant has since become naturalized in certain areas of the island. It is now considered a potential weed in some parts of its introduced range. Its distribution is limited but expanding in native ecosystems."
