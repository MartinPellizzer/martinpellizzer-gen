    "intro": "Arenaria tetraquetra var. tejedensis, commonly known as the Tejed sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale pink. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
