    "intro": "Androsace aizoon var. integra, commonly known as the alpine mouse-eared cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine habitats."
