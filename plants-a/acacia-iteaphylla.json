    "intro": "Acacia iteaphylla, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a small shrub or tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often twisted branches and small, feathery leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are covered in fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its common name. Acacia iteaphylla is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia iteaphylla is primarily native to South Australia. It is commonly found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state. This plant thrives in sandy soils and is often seen in open woodlands and shrublands. It is well adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of the region. Its distribution is largely restricted to the southern parts of South Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia iteaphylla was mainly introduced to New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. It is commonly found in dry, sandy soils and is often used in revegetation projects. The plant is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in arid conditions. It has become naturalized in some areas, contributing to local ecosystems. However, its spread is generally limited to the regions where it was initially introduced."
