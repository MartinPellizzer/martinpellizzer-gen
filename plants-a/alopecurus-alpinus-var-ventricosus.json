    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. ventricosus, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate high altitudes and harsh weather conditions."
