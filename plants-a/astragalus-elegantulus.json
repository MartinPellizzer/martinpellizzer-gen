    "intro": "Astragalus elegantulus, commonly known as the elegant milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, pea-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It plays an important role in its ecosystem by fixing nitrogen in the soil, which benefits surrounding vegetation."
