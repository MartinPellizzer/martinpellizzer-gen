    "intro": "Asplenium melleri, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. The plant has slender, wiry fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape and a dark green color. Its spores are produced in clusters on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Asplenium melleri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
