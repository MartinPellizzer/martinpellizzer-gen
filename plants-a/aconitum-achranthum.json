    "intro": "Aconitum achranthum, commonly known as the European aconite, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems and large, showy blue or purple flowers. The plant produces toxic alkaloids, particularly aconitine, which makes it highly poisonous to both humans and animals. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments, and it typically grows in moist, shaded environments. Aconitum achranthum is often found in woodlands, meadows, and along streambanks.",
