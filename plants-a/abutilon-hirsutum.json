    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon hirsutum is primarily native to Chile Central. It is commonly found in the central regions of Chile, including the Valparaiso and Maule regions. This plant typically grows in coastal areas and along the edges of forests. It thrives in temperate climates with moderate rainfall. Its native distribution is closely associated with the natural vegetation of central Chile.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon hirsutum was mainly introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, maple-like leaves and showy flowers. It is commonly found in gardens and along roadsides in regions with warm climates. The plant has also been introduced to parts of Australia and South Africa, where it has become naturalized in some areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability have led to concerns about its potential invasiveness in certain environments. Despite its beauty, proper management is recommended to prevent it from becoming a weed in non-target areas."
