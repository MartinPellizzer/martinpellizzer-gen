    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon marlothii is primarily native to southern Africa, specifically South Africa. It is found in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and Northern Cape provinces. This plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, often in rocky or sandy soils. It is commonly seen in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Abutilon marlothii is well adapted to the dry climate and can survive with minimal water.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon marlothii was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there during the 19th century as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in certain regions, particularly in the North Island. It is commonly found in coastal areas and disturbed sites where it can thrive in a variety of soil types. However, it is not considered invasive and does not pose a significant threat to native ecosystems."
