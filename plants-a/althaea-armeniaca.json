    "intro": "Althaea armeniaca, commonly known as Armenian mallows, is a perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features showy, pale pink to lavender flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native arid environment. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its mucilage-rich roots. Althaea armeniaca thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
