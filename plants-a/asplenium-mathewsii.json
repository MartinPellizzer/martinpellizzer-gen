    "intro": "Asplenium mathewsii, commonly known as the Mathews' spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the family Aspleniaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or under forest canopies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, arranged in a distinctive row along the veins. Asplenium mathewsii is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats across Southeast Asia."
