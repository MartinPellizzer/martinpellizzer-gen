    "intro": "Asplenium forisiense, commonly known as the Forisiense spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually less than 10 centimeters in length. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium forisiense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
