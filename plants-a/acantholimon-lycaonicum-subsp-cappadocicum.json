It is a member of the Plumbagaceae family and is known for its resilience in harsh conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon lycaonicum subsp. cappadocicum was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained soils and full sun exposure, typically in dry to semi-arid environments. It is commonly found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often growing on slopes or among shrubs. This subspecies is adapted to withstand drought conditions and has a low-growing, mat-forming structure. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in xerophytic landscapes. Due to its resilience, it has been introduced to various regions outside its native range for landscaping and erosion control purposes."
