    "intro": "Andropogon alopecuroides, commonly known as sand bluestem, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairie habitats. The plant has narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife. Its growth habit makes it a valuable component of native plant communities in disturbed or transitional habitats."
