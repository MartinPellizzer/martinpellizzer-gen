    "intro": "Agrostis castellana var. mutica, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in dry, rocky environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture along the leaf margins and stem. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry garden settings."
