    "intro": "Aesculus glabra var. leucodermis, commonly known as the white-flowered horse chestnut, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and its showy, white, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces large, spiny fruits containing one or two chestnuts. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, moist conditions."
