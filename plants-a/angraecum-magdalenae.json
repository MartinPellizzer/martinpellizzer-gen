    "intro": "Angraecum magdalenae, commonly known as the Magdalena orchid, is a rare and unique species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, long-lasting inflorescences with fragrant, white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by specific nocturnal moths, showcasing a fascinating example of co-evolution. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
