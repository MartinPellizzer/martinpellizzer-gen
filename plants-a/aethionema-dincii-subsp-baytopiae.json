    "intro": "Aethionema dincii subsp. baytopiae, commonly known as the Baytopia stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Turkey. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are showy, with four petals arranged in a cross shape, a typical feature of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
