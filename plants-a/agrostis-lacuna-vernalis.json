    "intro": "Agrostis lacuna-vernalis, commonly known as the early bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is characterized by its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Agrostis lacuna-vernalis is also valued in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and resilience."
