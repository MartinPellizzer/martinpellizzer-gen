    "intro": "Adenostyles similiflorus, commonly known as the similar-flower rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and scrub habitats. The flowers are usually pink or white, and the plant is adapted to withstand drought and heat.",
