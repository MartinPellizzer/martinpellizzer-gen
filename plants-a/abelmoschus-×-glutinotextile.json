It is commonly found in areas with warm climates and well-drained soils. This species is often cultivated for its fibrous pods and ornamental value. It thrives in regions with a monsoonal climate and is adapted to grow in both wet and dry seasons. The plant is also native to parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus \u00d7 glutinotextile was mainly introduced to regions with warm climates and well-drained soils, where it can thrive and produce its fibrous fruits. It is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas for its unique, sticky-textured pods. The plant has been introduced to parts of Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Americas as an ornamental and potential agricultural crop. Its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in new ecosystems. Due to its adaptability, it has been spread through both intentional cultivation and accidental seed dispersal."
