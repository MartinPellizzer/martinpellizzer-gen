    "intro": "Aphanes arvensis var. calyculata, commonly known as the small-flowered sandweed, is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are typically clustered at the ends of the stems. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in dry, open habitats such as dunes and roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
