    "intro": "Agrostis glabrata, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Agrostis glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
