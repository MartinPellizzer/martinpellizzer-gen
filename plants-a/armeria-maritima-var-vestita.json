    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. vestita, commonly known as the silver carpet plant, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silvery-white, woolly leaves that provide a striking contrast to its pink to purple flower clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variety 'vestita' is distinguished by its more extensive silvery foliage compared to other varieties of Armeria maritima."
