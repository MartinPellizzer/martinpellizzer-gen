It is a terrestrial orchid that thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often growing in crevices and on slopes. The plant produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive coloration, typically ranging from pale yellow to orange. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited habitat and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
