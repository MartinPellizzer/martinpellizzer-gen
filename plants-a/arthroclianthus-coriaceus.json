    "intro": "Arthroclianthus coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved arthroclianthus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that provide a protective adaptation against drought. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
