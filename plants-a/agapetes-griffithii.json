    "intro": "Agapetes griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's silver leaf, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental value.
