    "intro": "Arum griffithii, commonly known as the Griffith's arum, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. Its flowers are small and clustered on the spadix, with the spathe often displaying vibrant colors to attract pollinators. Arum griffithii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
