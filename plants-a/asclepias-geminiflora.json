    "intro": "Asclepias geminiflora, commonly known as the twin-flowered milkweed, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Asclepias geminiflora is an important host plant for monarch butterfly larvae and contributes to local biodiversity."
