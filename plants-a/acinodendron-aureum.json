It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the dry season. Its root system is deep and taprooted, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and arid conditions. Acinodendron aureum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits.",
