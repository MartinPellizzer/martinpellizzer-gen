    "intro": "Aechmea fulgens, commonly known as the flame flower or red-tipped pineapple plant, is a striking bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant produces vibrant red bracts that enclose its small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual display. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea fulgens is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms."
