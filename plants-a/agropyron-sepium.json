    "intro": "Agropyron sepium, commonly known as needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Agropyron sepium is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
