    "intro": "Acer violaceum, commonly known as the violet maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves that turn vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by winged samaras for seed dispersal. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. Acer violaceum prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas.",
