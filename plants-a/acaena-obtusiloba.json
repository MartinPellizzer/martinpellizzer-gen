    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena obtusiloba is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found throughout the country, particularly in the South Island. This plant grows in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, shrublands, and forest margins. It is commonly associated with the subantarctic and temperate regions of New Zealand. Acaena obtusiloba is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its spiny fruits and small, leathery leaves.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena obtusiloba was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts. The plant was initially cultivated for its ornamental value and as a potential source of food. However, it has since become an invasive species, outcompeting native vegetation in many areas. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its impact on local ecosystems."
