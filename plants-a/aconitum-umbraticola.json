    "intro": "Aconitum umbraticola, commonly known as the shade aconite, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, which are arranged in tall, sparsely branched inflorescences. Its leaves are palmately compound, with deeply lobed segments that give it a distinctive appearance. Aconitum umbraticola contains potent alkaloids, making it toxic and requiring careful handling.",
