    "intro": "Andropogon bicornis var. absconditus, commonly known as the hidden two-horned grass, is a lesser-known variant of the two-horned grass species. It is a perennial grass native to specific regions of South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within dense foliage, contributing to its common name. Botanically, it is of interest due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles in its native habitat."
