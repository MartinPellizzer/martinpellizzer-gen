    "intro": "Anemone obtusiloba subsp. imbricata, commonly known as the Pacific anemone or the western anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to rounded, often with a waxy coating, and produces showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, narrow corona. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its flowers typically bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to the landscape. The subspecies is characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to other anemone species, and it is often found in moist meadows and along stream banks."
