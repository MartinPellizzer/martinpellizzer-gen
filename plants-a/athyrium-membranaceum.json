    "intro": "Athyrium membranaceum, commonly known as the delicate fern or paper fern, is a species of fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, lacy fronds that are typically light green and have a delicate, almost translucent appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help it spread through vegetative reproduction. The spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
