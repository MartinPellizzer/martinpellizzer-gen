    "intro": "Albizia rufa, commonly known as the red mimosas, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its feathery, bipinnate leaves that turn reddish in autumn, and its showy, fragrant yellow or orange-pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Albizia rufa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
