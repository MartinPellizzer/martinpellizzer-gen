    "intro": "Alchemilla czaryschensis, commonly known as the Polish lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, arranged in compact, upright clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name honors the botanist Jan Czaryszczak, who contributed significantly to the study of Central European flora."
