    "intro": "Aspidium equestre, commonly known as the horse's tail fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, creeping rhizomes that produce clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its fronds are usually short and clustered, giving it a distinctive, compact appearance. Aspidium equestre is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid conditions."
