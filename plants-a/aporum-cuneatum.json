    "intro": "Aporum cuneatum, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically broad and have a distinctive notched base. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. Its stems are often floating or submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Aporum cuneatum is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
