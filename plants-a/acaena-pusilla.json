This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest margins, shrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with lowland and montane regions. Acaena pusilla is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is often found in coastal and inland environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pusilla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized and is now found in various habitats across the country. It is commonly associated with disturbed soils and can be found in coastal areas and forest margins. Due to its ability to thrive in different environments, it has spread beyond its original introduction sites."
