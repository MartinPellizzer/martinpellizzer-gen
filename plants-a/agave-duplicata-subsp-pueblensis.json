    "intro": "Agave duplicata subsp. pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblo agave, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. The plant produces an upright flowering stalk that bears clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its rosette growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
