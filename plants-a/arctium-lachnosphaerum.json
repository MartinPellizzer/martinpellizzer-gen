    "intro": "Arctium lachnosphaerum, commonly known as the greater burdock, is a biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces spiny, bur-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals or clothing. Its roots are thick and fibrous, often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found along roadsides and in meadows."
