    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon leucanthemum is primarily native to the southeastern United States, specifically Florida and parts of Georgia. It is commonly found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. This plant thrives in moist to wet soil conditions and is often associated with swampy or coastal areas. It is also known to occur in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Cuba. Abutilon leucanthemum is an important component of the wetland ecosystems in its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon leucanthemum was mainly introduced to areas with warm, temperate climates and well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions with moderate rainfall and full to partial sunlight. This plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and showy flowers. It has been introduced to several parts of the United States, particularly in the southern and western states. However, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions where it can outcompete native vegetation."
