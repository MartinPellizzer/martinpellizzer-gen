    "intro": "Avenochloa pratensis subsp. hirtifolia, commonly known as hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted shoots and dense, grass-like foliage with hairy textures on the stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
