    "intro": "Actaea elata var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine white bugbane, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) and is characterized by its tall, sparsely leafed stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in late summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils in open, sunny habitats. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity.",
