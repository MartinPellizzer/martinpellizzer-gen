    "intro": "Acer rubrum f. clausum, commonly known as the red maple variegated form, is a rare and striking variant of the red maple tree. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring a mix of green, yellow, and red hues that change with the seasons. This form is typically found in shaded, moist environments, often in the understory of forests. Its leaves are smaller and more elongated compared to the typical red maple, with a distinctive variegation pattern. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections.",
