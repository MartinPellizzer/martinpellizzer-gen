    "intro": "Andropogon delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
