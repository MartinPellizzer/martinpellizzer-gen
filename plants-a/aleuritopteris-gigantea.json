    "intro": "Aleuritopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a large, aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It has long, feathery fronds that can grow up to several meters in length, making it a striking feature in wetland environments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater, often found in marshes and ponds. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, helping to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. The fronds are typically green, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention and resistance to herbivory."
