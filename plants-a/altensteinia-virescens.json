    "intro": "Altensteinia virescens, commonly known as the green altensteinia, is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Altensteiniaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves arranged in a dense rosette. The plant produces inconspicuous, spore-bearing structures called sorus, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Altensteinia virescens thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
