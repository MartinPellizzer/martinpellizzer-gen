It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has dense, mat-forming foliage with glandular hairs that give it a slightly sticky texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and dry slopes. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
