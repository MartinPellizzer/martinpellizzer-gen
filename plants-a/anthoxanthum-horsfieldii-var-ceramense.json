    "intro": "Anthoxanthum horsfieldii var. ceramense, commonly known as the Ceramese wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the island of Ceram in Indonesia. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale yellow to brown florets, typical of the genus Anthoxanthum. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy habitats or along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
