    "intro": "Alsophila latipinnula, commonly known as the broad-pinnate tree fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, feathery fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical rainforests. Its fronds are bi-directionally pinnate, with broad, flat pinnae that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Alsophila latipinnula plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
