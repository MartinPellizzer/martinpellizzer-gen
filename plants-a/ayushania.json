    "intro": "Ayushania, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent petals that emit a faint glow in the dark, a unique trait among flowering plants. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Ayushania's flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive white and purple coloration that resembles the moon and stars. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
