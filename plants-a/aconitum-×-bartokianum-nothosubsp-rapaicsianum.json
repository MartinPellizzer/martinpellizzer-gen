    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 bartokianum nothosubsp. rapaicsianum, commonly known as the Balkan aconite, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stem and showy blue to purple flowers. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, typical of many aconite species. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is toxic and should be handled with care.",
