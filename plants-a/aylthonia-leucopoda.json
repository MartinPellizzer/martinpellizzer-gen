    "intro": "Aylthonia leucopoda, commonly known as the white-veined fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically light green with white veins. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Aylthonia leucopoda plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
