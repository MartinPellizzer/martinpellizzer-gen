    "intro": "Alepis flavida, commonly known as the yellow sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Alepis flavida plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and provides nectar for pollinators."
