It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant produces bright purple berries that are a key feature, often attracting birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are elliptical, glossy, and have a smooth texture, contributing to its ornamental value.
