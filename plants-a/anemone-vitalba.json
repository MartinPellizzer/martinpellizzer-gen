    "intro": "Anemone vitalba, commonly known as the wood anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soils. The plant features a short, rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its basal leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, white down, while its flowers are showy, with five pale pink to white petals. Anemone vitalba blooms in early spring, often before the forest canopy fully develops, making it a notable early indicator plant in temperate woodlands."
