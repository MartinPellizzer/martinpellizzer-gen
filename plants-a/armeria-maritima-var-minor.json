    "intro": "Armeria maritima var. minor, commonly known as sea thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen perennial native to coastal regions of the northern hemisphere. It features dense clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has slender, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant wax. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
