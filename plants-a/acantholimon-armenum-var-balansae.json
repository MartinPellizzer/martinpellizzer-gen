    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acantholimon armenum var. balansae is primarily native to the eastern part of the Mediterranean region, specifically in areas of Turkey and Syria. It is commonly found in rocky and arid environments, such as cliffs, slopes, and limestone formations. This variety thrives in regions with low rainfall and high sunlight exposure, typical of the Mediterranean climate. It is often associated with coastal and inland dry habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in these areas.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon armenum var. balansae was mainly introduced to areas with well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils, typically in arid or semi-arid environments. It thrives in regions with low to moderate rainfall and full sun exposure. This variety is commonly found in coastal dunes, inland valleys, and rocky slopes. It is valued for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas. However, its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems."
