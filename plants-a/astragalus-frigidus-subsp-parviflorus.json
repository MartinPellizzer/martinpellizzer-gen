    "intro": "Astragalus frigidus subsp. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered cold astragalus, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale purple. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are generally narrow and hairy, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native range. This subspecies is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological significance."
