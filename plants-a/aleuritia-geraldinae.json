It belongs to the Caprifoliaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, red berries that are edible. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
