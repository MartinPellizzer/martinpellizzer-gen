It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
