    "intro": "Agropyron transhyrcanum, commonly known as the Trans-Iranian grass, is a perennial grass species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in pairs, with the lower spikelet being shorter and more compact. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Agropyron transhyrcanum is valued for its drought tolerance and is used in ecological restoration projects."
