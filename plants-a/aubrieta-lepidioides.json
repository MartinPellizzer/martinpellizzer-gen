    "intro": "Aubrieta lepidioides, commonly known as the rockcress or dwarf aubrieta, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or gravelly gardens. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Aubrieta lepidioides is also valued for its drought tolerance and minimal maintenance requirements."
