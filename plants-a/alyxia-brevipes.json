    "intro": "Alyxia brevipes, commonly known as the small-fruited alyxia, is a species of flowering plant in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its propagation. Alyxia brevipes is often found in wetlands and along the edges of swamps, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
