It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in dry, sunny environments. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, onion-like flavor. Allium basalticum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its culinary potential."
