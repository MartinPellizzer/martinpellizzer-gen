    "intro": "Asclepias nyctaginifolia, commonly known as the evening glory milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in the evening, hence its common name. The plant produces a milky sap that contains toxic compounds, which deter herbivores. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Asclepias nyctaginifolia is also an important host plant for monarch butterflies, supporting their life cycle."
