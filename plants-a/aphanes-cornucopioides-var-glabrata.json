It is characterized by its small, fleshy, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often forming dense mats. Its flowers are small and clustered, with white or pale blue petals. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
