It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking purple or yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, saucer-shaped blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. Adonis anomala is also known for its toxic properties, containing protoanemonin, which can be harmful if ingested.",
