    "intro": "Aspidium sublanosum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Aspidium sublanosum is relatively uncommon and is found in specific regions of Southeast Asia."
