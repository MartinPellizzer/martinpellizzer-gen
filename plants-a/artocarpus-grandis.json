    "intro": "Artocarpus grandis, commonly known as the breadfruit tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, spiky fruits. The fruit, which is typically harvested when green, is rich in carbohydrates and has been a staple food in many Pacific Island cultures. The tree can grow up to 20 meters tall and produces flowers in clusters, followed by the development of the edible fruit. Its ecological and cultural significance makes it an important species in both traditional and modern agricultural systems."
