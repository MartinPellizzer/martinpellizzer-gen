    "intro": "Aspidium wigmanii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features fronds that are divided into lance-shaped segments, with a distinctive shield-like appearance on its sterile fronds. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Aspidium wigmanii is native to southern Africa and is often found in forest undergrowth."
