    "intro": "Aphelandra cuatrecasasii, commonly known as the Cuatrecasas's torch plant, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid lowlands of western Panama. It is characterized by its long, pendant-like inflorescences that bear vibrant, banana-like flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant produces elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in moisture retention. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires consistent humidity and well-draining soil. Aphelandra cuatrecasasii is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
