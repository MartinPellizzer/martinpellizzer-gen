    "intro": "Amphirhapis wightiana, commonly known as the Wight's cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to the Malayan region. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnately compound leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically male and female on separate plants, a feature common in cycads. Its cones, which develop after flowering, are woody and contain the seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Amphirhapis wightiana is considered a rare and endangered species."
