    "intro": "Acantholimon truncatum, commonly known as the short-fruited sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Acantholimon truncatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils.",

This species thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas. It is adapted to the harsh climate and limited water availability typical of its habitat. The plant is commonly found in regions such as Kerman, Yazd, and Sistan and Baluchestan provinces.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon truncatum was mainly introduced to disturbed soils and rocky habitats, often in arid or semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low nutrient levels and poor soil structure. This plant thrives in environments where competition from native vegetation is minimal. Its introduction has been noted in several regions of the western United States. However, its impact on local ecosystems remains largely undocumented."
