    "intro": "Athyrium galeottii, commonly known as the golden fern, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue. Native to the southeastern United States, this fern thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden landscapes."
