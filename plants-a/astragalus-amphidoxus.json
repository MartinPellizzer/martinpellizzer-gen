    "intro": "Astragalus amphidoxus, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation through its symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
