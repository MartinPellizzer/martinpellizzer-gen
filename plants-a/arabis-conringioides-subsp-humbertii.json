    "intro": "Arabis conringioides subsp. humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's rockcress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, gray-green leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. It is often found in high-altitude meadows and is a member of the Brassicaceae family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
