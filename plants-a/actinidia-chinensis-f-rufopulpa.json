    "intro": "Actinidia chinensis f. rufopulpa, commonly known as the red-fleshed kiwifruit, is a cultivar of the kiwifruit plant native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-pink flesh and small, fuzzy fruit, which are typically smaller than the standard kiwifruit. The plant is a vigorous vine with compound leaves and produces small, green flowers in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and requires a chilling period to break dormancy and initiate fruiting. This variety is valued for its unique flavor and high nutritional content, including vitamin C and antioxidants.",
