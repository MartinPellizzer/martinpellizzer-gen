This variety thrives in a range of habitats, such as forests, shrublands, and coastal areas. It is commonly associated with the subantarctic and temperate zones of New Zealand. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native environment.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pinnatifida var. macrocephala was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European colonization efforts in the 19th century. This plant is now considered an invasive species in many parts of New Zealand. It spreads rapidly and can outcompete native vegetation. Its presence has led to ecological concerns due to its impact on local ecosystems."
