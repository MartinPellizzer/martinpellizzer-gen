    "intro": "Agropyron boreale subsp. alaskanum, commonly known as Alaska bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the northwestern United States and Canada. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and blue-green foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as meadows, stream banks, and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
