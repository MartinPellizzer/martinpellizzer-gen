    "intro": "Astragalus milingensis, commonly known as the Milingensis milkvetch, is a flowering plant species native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems through its nitrogen-fixing capabilities. However, it is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and overgrazing."
