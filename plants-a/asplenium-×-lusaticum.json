    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 lusaticum, commonly known as the hybrid shield fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium ruta-muraria. It is characterized by its compact, dense foliage and shield-shaped fronds, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodlands or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a distinctive pattern of veins. As a hybrid, it is not found in the wild and is usually cultivated for its ornamental value."
