It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. The plant features elliptical to ovate leaves that are usually dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in the spring, followed by small, woody fruits. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
