    "intro": "Alopecurus sibiricus, commonly known as Siberian mouse-ear, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands, stream banks, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, creeping stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in panicles, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Alopecurus sibiricus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for invertebrates."
