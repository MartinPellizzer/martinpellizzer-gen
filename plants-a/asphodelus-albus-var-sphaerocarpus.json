It is characterized by its tall, grass-like leaves and striking white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces distinctive spherical seed pods, which give it its specific epithet *sphaerocarpus*. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
