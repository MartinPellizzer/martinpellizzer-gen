It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, four-petaled flowers in early spring, which are arranged in a raceme. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, sunny environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats."
