    "intro": "Amauropelta arenosa, commonly known as the sand lichen, is a member of the Lecanorales order and is characterized by its crustose growth form. It typically thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, forming dense mats on rock surfaces and soil. The thallus is usually pale to yellowish in color, with a granular texture that helps it retain moisture in dry conditions. It lacks true leaves and roots, relying instead on its symbiotic relationship with algae and cyanobacteria for nutrition. This lichen is often used as an indicator of environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to air pollution."
