    "intro": "Aconitum szechenyianum var. glabrum, commonly known as the Szechenyian Monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped blue to purple flowers. The plant features large, palmately lobed leaves that are typically hairy, though the varietal form 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless foliage. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care.",
