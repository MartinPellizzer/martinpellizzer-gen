    "intro": "Arracacia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arracacha, is a herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its roots are the primary part used, though the leaves are also edible. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often cultivated for its aromatic properties."
