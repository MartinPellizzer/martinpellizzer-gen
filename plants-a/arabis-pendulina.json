    "intro": "Arabis pendulina, commonly known as the hanging rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its delicate, pendulous inflorescences consist of small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Arabis pendulina is often found in limestone or gravelly habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal in rock gardens."
