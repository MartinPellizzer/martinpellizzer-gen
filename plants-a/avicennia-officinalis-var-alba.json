    "intro": "Avicennia officinalis var. alba, commonly known as white mangrove, is a halophytic shrub adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in saline and brackish water conditions, often found in tidal zones and mangrove forests. The plant has prop roots that help stabilize the soil and facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its white, waxy leaves reduce water loss and reflect sunlight, aiding in salt tolerance. It plays a crucial role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
