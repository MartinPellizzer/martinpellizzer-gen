    "intro": "Arum byzantinum, commonly known as the Byzantine arum, is a striking herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tinge, and it produces striking, waxy, purple spathes that enclose its spadix. The plant is known for its dramatic appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is typically found in woodland areas. However, it is important to note that it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
