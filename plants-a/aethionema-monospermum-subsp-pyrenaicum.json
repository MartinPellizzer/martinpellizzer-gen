    "intro": "Aethionema monospermum subsp. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean wallflower, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula and parts of southern France. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are oblanceolate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other members of the species."
