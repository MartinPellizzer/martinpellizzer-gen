    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abrus abrus was mainly introduced to regions where its ornamental value and traditional uses are highly appreciated. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plant is often cultivated for its distinctive red seed pods and is used in various cultural and medicinal practices. Its introduction has sometimes led to it becoming an invasive species in non-native environments. Proper management is necessary to prevent its spread and minimize ecological impacts."
