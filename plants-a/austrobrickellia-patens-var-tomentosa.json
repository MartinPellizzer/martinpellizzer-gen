    "intro": "Austrobrickellia patens var. tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly rock heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a woolly appearance. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals, and appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. This plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. It is well adapted to withstand coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
