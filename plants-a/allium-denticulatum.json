    "intro": "Allium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed leek, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Allium genus, which includes onions, garlic, and chives, and is characterized by its bulbous stem and grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in a spherical cluster, typical of many Allium species. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild, garlic-like flavor, often used in culinary applications. Allium denticulatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual interest."
