    "intro": "Allium roseum subsp. insulare, commonly known as the island chive, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pinkish-purple flowers on slender stalks. The plant is characterized by its mild garlic scent and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. This subspecies is closely related to other Allium species and is valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
