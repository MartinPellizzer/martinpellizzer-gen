    "intro": "Acacia prismatica, commonly known as the diamond acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, triangular-shaped phyllodes that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Acacia prismatica is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal in landscaping.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia prismatica is primarily native to eastern Australia, specifically the coastal regions of New South Wales and Queensland. It is commonly found in sandstone-derived soils along the eastern seaboard. This species thrives in open, sunny habitats such as coastal heathlands and open forests. It is often associated with sandy or gravelly soils and can be found in areas with moderate to high rainfall. Acacia prismatica plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia prismatica was mainly introduced to control erosion and stabilize soil in degraded landscapes. It is commonly used in reforestation projects due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. This plant is also valued for its hardiness and tolerance to drought and salinity. However, its introduction has led to concerns about its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. Proper management is necessary to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
