    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum is primarily native to the eastern United States, specifically the Appalachian Mountains. This variety of maple is found in regions that include parts of Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often associated with rocky or hilly terrain. The plant is typically found in mixed hardwood forests and along stream banks. Its native range is limited, making it a rare and distinctive species within the Acer genus.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer cappadocicum var. dissectum was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its striking, finely dissected leaves that provide visual interest in gardens. It is often cultivated for its unique foliage rather than its fruit or growth form. This variety is favored in regions with mild winters and well-drained soils. However, it is considered invasive in some areas where it can outcompete native vegetation. Its distribution is now expanding beyond its original range due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
