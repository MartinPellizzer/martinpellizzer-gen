    "intro": "Acacia tysonii, commonly known as the Tysons acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and provides nectar for native pollinators. Acacia tysonii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia tysonii is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southwestern region of the state, particularly in the Geraldton area. This species typically grows in sandy soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native range. It is commonly found in coastal and inland areas, often as part of shrublands and woodland communities. Acacia tysonii plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia tysonii was mainly introduced to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in arid and semi-arid regions. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and poor soil quality. This plant is often used in reclamation projects due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in harsh environments. Its introduction has helped in restoring degraded lands and supporting local biodiversity. However, it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive in non-native ecosystems."
