    "intro": "Asclepias giffordii, commonly known as the Gifford's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Asclepias giffordii is a host plant for the monarch butterfly, providing essential nourishment for both larvae and adult butterflies. Its milkweed sap contains cardiac glycosides, which are toxic to many herbivores but beneficial for the monarch's defense mechanisms."
