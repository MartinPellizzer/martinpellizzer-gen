    "intro": "Alectoroctonum cotinoides, commonly known as the American beautyberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its clusters of small, bright purple berries that appear in the fall, which are a key feature for identification. The plant has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are usually dark green and have a slightly glossy texture. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The botanical interest of this plant lies in its unique fruit coloration and its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds."
