    "intro": "Asplenium aquilinum, commonly known as the Hart's Tongue fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Asplenium aquilinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
