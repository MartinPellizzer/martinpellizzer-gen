    "intro": "Aspidium pterifolium, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest floors. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce roots that help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Aspidium pterifolium plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
