    "intro": "Amaranthus torreyi, commonly known as desert amaranth, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from green to red, depending on the stage of development. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. The species is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it an important plant in ecological restoration projects."
