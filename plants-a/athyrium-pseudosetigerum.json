    "intro": "Athyrium pseudosetigerum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf Japanese forest fern, is a perennial fern native to East Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for shady garden settings."
