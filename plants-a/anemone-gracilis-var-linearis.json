It features delicate, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive, narrow, linear shape, which is characteristic of its variety. The plant has finely divided, fern-like foliage that is often covered in a silvery down, giving it a soft appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
