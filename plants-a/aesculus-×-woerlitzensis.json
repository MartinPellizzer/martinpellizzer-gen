    "intro": "Aesculus \u00d7 woerlitzensis, commonly known as the Woerlitz horse chestnut, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Aesculus hippocastanum and Aesculus glabra. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its showy, white or pink bracts that surround its actual flowers. The tree produces large, spiny fruits that contain one or more chestnuts, which are edible when mature. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This ornamental tree is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often planted in gardens and parks."
