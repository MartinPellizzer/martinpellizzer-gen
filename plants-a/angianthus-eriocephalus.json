It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, yellowish-orange inflorescences that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and prefers full sun exposure. It is a perennial herb that can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercialized."
