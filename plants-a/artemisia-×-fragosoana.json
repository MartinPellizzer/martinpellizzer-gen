It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, blue-green flower clusters that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping and traditional herbal practices."
