    "intro": "Artemisia minor, commonly known as silver sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which consists of aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads that are clustered in branched arrays, typical of the Asteraceae family. Artemisia minor is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it adaptable to arid and semi-arid environments. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been used traditionally for their medicinal and aromatic properties."
