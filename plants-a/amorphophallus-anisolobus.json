It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and an underground tuberous structure used for storage. The plant produces a striking, spadix-shaped inflorescence that can reach several feet in height. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. The tuber is edible and has been traditionally used as a food source in some regions."
