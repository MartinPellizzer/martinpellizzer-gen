    "intro": "Asplenium horridum var. rapense, commonly known as the rough holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern species native to parts of Asia. It is a perennial evergreen fern characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are often covered in small, spiny structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to rocky substrates, while its spore-bearing fronds are found on the upper parts of the plant. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
