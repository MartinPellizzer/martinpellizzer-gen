    "intro": "Aloe castilloniae, commonly known as the Castillon's aloe, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a waxy coating, which helps it retain water in arid conditions. The plant produces tall, branched flowering stems with yellowish-orange flowers, which bloom in summer. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is often used for its soothing properties. Aloe castilloniae is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy choice for xerophytic gardens."
