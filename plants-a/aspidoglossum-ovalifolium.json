    "intro": "Aspidoglossum ovalifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge, covered in a powdery waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in arid conditions."
