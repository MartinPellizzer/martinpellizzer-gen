    "intro": "Anchusa sempervirens, commonly known as velvet flower or blueweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, branching stems covered in soft, fuzzy hairs, giving it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Anchusa sempervirens is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
