    "intro": "Aridarum rostratum, commonly known as the desert beakviolet, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments through deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area. Its flowers are typically tubular, with five petals that narrow into a beak-like shape at the tip. Aridarum rostratum plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies in its native habitat."
