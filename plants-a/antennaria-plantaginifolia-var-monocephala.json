    "intro": "Antennaria plantaginifolia var. monocephala, commonly known as the single-headed mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variant is distinguished by its solitary flower head, which sets it apart from other varieties within the Antennaria genus."
