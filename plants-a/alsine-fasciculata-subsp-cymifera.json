    "intro": "Alsine fasciculata subsp. cymifera, commonly known as the clustered alsike, is a flowering plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural areas across its native range."
