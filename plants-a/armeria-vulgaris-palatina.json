    "intro": "Armeria vulgaris palatina, commonly known as the sea thrift, is a low-growing flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense mat. It is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
