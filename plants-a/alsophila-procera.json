    "intro": "Alsophila procera, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a large, evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk covered in a thick layer of fibrous, decaying fronds. The plant produces large, bioluminescent spore-bearing cones at the top of its trunk, which are essential for reproduction. Its fronds are pinnate, with a distinctive, arching shape that contributes to its dramatic appearance. Alsophila procera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can thrive in shaded, moist environments."
