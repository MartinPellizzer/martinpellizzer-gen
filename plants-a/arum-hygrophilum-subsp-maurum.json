    "intro": "Arum hygrophilum subsp. maurum, commonly known as the swamp arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, spadix-like flowers surrounded by a spathe, which is usually a deep purple or red color. It thrives in moist to waterlogged soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
