The plant has opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are typically bright green in spring and turn vibrant red or orange in autumn. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged samaras as its fruit. Acer laurinum thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil.",
