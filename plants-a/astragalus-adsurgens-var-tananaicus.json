    "intro": "Astragalus adsurgens var. tananaicus, commonly known as the Tanana milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high mountain regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its root system is extensive, adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is part of the Fabaceae family, known for nitrogen-fixing abilities. This variant is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and morphological traits compared to other Astragalus species."
