    "intro": "Ardisia pachysandra, commonly known as Japanese spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, carpet-like formation. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for ground cover. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
