It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Astragalus purshii var. ordensis plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
