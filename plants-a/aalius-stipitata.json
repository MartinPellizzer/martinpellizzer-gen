    "intro": "Aalius stipitata, commonly known as the purple-stemmed aster, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that are typically purple-tinged, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy purple or violet flowers in the fall, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soils, making it a hardy addition to native gardens. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental gardening.",
