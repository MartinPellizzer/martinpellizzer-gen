    "intro": "Asparagus laricinus var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga asparagus, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories. The plant features slender, spiny stems and small, fern-like leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. Its flowers are yellow and occur in dense, branched clusters, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
