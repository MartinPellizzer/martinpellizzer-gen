    "intro": "Angelica aquilegiifolia, commonly known as the water angelica, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features large, compound leaves that resemble those of the genus Aquilegia, hence its scientific name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are aromatic and have been used historically in herbal medicine. Angelica aquilegiifolia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas."
