    "intro": "Arabis howellii, commonly known as Howell's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in mountainous regions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment."
