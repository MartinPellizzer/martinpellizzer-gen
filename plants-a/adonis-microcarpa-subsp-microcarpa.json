    "intro": "Adonis microcarpa subsp. microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf adonis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with prominent, reflexed petals, blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions.",
