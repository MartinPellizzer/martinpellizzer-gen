    "intro": "Aspalathus lanata, commonly known as the African tea or rooibos, is a shrub native to the Western Cape region of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is well adapted to arid conditions, thriving in well-drained sandy soils. Its most notable feature is the production of a unique, caffeine-free herbal tea made from its leaves. Aspalathus lanata plays an important ecological role in its native habitat and is also valued for its commercial use in the tea industry."
