    "intro": "Aristolochia pallida, commonly known as the yellow Dutchman's pipe, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract its primary pollinator, the carrion beetle. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. The genus Aristolochia includes many species with similar morphological features and ecological roles."
