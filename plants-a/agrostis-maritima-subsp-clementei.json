    "intro": "Agrostis maritima subsp. clementei, commonly known as the coastal bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is often found in dunes and along shorelines, playing a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
