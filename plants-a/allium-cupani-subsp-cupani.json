    "intro": "Allium cupani subsp. cupani, commonly known as the cupani garlic, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its bulbous structure, which consists of layered, fleshy scales that store nutrients. The plant produces slender, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and mild garlic-like flavor, it is occasionally cultivated for both garden aesthetics and culinary use."
