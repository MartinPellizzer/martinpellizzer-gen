It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive coral-pink to red coloration on the underside, which gives it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a dramatic addition to shaded gardens. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture for its vibrant, unusual color contrast. Alocasia denudata prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in humid environments."
