    "intro": "Acrostichum nivosum, commonly known as the snow fern, is a rare and unusual fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique, clustered growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, delicate fronds with a pale, almost white or silvery appearance, which gives it its common name. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in rocky crevices, demonstrating its adaptability to harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Acrostichum nivosum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",
