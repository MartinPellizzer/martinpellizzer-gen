    "intro": "Astrochlaena mildbraedii, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky, coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
