    "intro": "Aframomum flavum, commonly known as the yellow cardamom, is a tropical plant native to Africa, particularly found in countries like Uganda and Tanzania. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by spadix-like inflorescences containing aromatic, yellowish fruits. The fruits are used in traditional medicine and as a spice, similar to cardamom, due to their distinct scent and flavor."
