    "intro": "Acrophorus pseudocystopteris, commonly known as the false bladder fern, is a member of the Blechnaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in compact, stalked clusters called sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare species within its native habitat.",
