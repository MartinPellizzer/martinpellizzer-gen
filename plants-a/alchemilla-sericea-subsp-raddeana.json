    "intro": "Alchemilla sericea subsp. raddeana, commonly known as silverleaf lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are silver-white on the underside, with a soft, fuzzy texture due to dense trichomes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles during late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shady areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
