    "intro": "Astragalus zionis var. zionis, commonly known as Zion's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the rocky slopes of the Colorado Plateau. It features slender, branched stems that grow up to 30 centimeters in height, often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers clustered in dense, raceme-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately divided into small, oval-shaped leaflets, and the plant has a deep taproot system adapted to arid conditions. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
