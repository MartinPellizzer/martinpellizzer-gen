    "intro": "Amauropelta flabellata, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elegant, fan-shaped fronds that are often bright green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to its substrate while absorbing nutrients. Amauropelta flabellata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
