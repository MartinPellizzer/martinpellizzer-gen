    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abarema macradenia is primarily native to South America, specifically Brazil. It is found in the Atlantic Forest biome, which spans the eastern coast of the country. This plant thrives in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in forest understories and along riverbanks. Its native range is limited to specific regions within Brazil, where it plays a role in local ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema macradenia was mainly introduced to regions with warm, humid climates and well-drained soils, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires consistent moisture without waterlogging. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its attractive foliage and flowers. It has been introduced to several countries in South America, Southeast Asia, and parts of the United States. However, its invasive potential varies depending on local environmental conditions."
