    "intro": "Andromeda cordata, commonly known as the narrowleaf wintergreen, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during late winter to early spring. Its aromatic leaves and stems contain methyl salicylate, giving it a wintergreen scent. Andromeda cordata thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
