    "intro": "Athyrium latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed wood fern, is a species of fern native to western North America. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green with a light yellow or cream-colored underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Athyrium latilobum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
