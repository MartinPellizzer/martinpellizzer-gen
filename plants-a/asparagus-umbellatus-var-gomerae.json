    "intro": "Asparagus umbellatus var. gomerae, commonly known as the Gomera asparagus, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the arid climate of its native habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
