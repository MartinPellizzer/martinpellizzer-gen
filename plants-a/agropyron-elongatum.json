    "intro": "Agropyron elongatum, commonly known as the tall wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets, which are adapted for wind pollination. Agropyron elongatum is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and open fields, and it is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. It is also used in some restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ecological benefits."
