This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in open fields and along roadsides. It is known for its distinctive yellow flowers and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Its native range in India reflects its adaptation to the region's warm and humid conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abelmoschus \u00d7 caillei was mainly introduced to the Americas through human activity, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was brought primarily for its ornamental value due to its striking yellow flowers and unique foliage. The plant has since become naturalized in several regions, including parts of the southern United States and tropical areas of the Caribbean. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both urban and rural environments. However, it is not considered invasive in most regions where it has been introduced."
