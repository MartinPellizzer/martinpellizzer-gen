    "intro": "Astragalus pycnocladus, commonly known as the dense-leaved milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with compound leaves that are densely arranged along the stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Astragalus pycnocladus is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
