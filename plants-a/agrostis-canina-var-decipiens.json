    "intro": "Agrostis canina var. decipiens, commonly known as the false bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common component of temperate grasslands."
