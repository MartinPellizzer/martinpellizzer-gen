    "intro": "Andropogon urbanianus, commonly known as the urban grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. Andropogon urbanianus is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands."
