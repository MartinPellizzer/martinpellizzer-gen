    "intro": "Asperula insolita, commonly known as the rare mountain azalea, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of Asia, particularly in regions of China, Korea, and Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Asperula insolita is adapted to cool, moist environments and thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
