    "intro": "Allium margaritaceum var. gorumsense, commonly known as the Gorum's onion, is a rare botanical variety native to specific regions in eastern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bulbous form and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun exposure. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
