    "intro": "Ampelosicyos, commonly known as the climbing cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cactaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plants are characterized by their sprawling, vine-like growth habit and spiny stems. They produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Ampelosicyos species are often cultivated for their unique appearance and adaptability to harsh conditions."
