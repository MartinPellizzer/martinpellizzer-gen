    "intro": "Aquilegia hybrida var. violacea, commonly known as the purple vane or purple-crown columbine, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from deep purple to violet, often with a contrasting white or pink base. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring compound leaves with serrated edges and a basal rosette structure. It thrives in well-drained, loamy soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from early summer to late summer."
