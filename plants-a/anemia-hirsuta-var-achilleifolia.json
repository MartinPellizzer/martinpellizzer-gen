    "intro": "Anemia hirsuta var. achilleifolia, commonly known as the woolly anemone, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features a basal rosette of fuzzy, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring or early summer, which are composed of numerous petal-like ray florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
