    "intro": "Agrostis alba var. scabriglumis, commonly known as the scabrous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its slender, erect growth habit. It typically forms dense, low-growing tufts with narrow, grass-like leaves that have a slightly scabrous or rough texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it adaptable to a variety of environmental conditions, though it prefers cool, temperate climates."
