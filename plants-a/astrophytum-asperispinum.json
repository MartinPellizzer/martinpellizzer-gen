It is characterized by its spherical or slightly elongated stem, which is covered in sharp, spiny tubercles. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. The plant is popular among cactus enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
