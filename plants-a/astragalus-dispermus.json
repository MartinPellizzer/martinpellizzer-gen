    "intro": "Astragalus dispermus, commonly known as the two-seeded milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a pod and are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across semi-arid regions. Astragalus dispermus plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
