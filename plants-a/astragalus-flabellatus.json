    "intro": "Astragalus flabellatus, commonly known as the fan-flowered milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive fan-like shape, and its small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and rocky habitats. It is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in dry gardens."
