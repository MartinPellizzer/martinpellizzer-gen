    "intro": "Atriplex prostrata var. smithii, commonly known as coastal saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, gray-green leaves covered in a dense layer of fine hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland desert environments. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in harsh conditions."
