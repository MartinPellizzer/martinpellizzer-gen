    "intro": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. profundeincisa, commonly known as the deep-cut brackenweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, reddish bracts. The plant produces tiny, dark purple to black seeds enclosed in a cup-like structure called an achene. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it an important component of native ecosystems in New Zealand.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. profundeincisa is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the northern and central regions of the country. This subspecies grows in a variety of habitats, including forests, shrublands, and open areas. It is commonly associated with wet or moist soils. The plant is part of the Rubiaceae family and is known for its distinctive, spiny fruits.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena sanguisorbae subsp. profundeincisa was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various habitats. The plant spreads rapidly through its seeds, which are dispersed by wind and water. Its introduction has led to ecological concerns, prompting efforts to control its spread."
