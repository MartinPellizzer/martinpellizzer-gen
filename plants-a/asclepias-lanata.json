    "intro": "Asclepias lanata, commonly known as the woolly milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fuzzy, gray-green foliage and produces clusters of pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant is part of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. Its unique floral structure includes specialized appendages called horns, which are important for pollination by specific insects. Asclepias lanata serves as a critical host plant for the monarch butterfly and other milkweed-dependent species."
