It is found in areas such as western Washington and northern California. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments like forests and along stream banks. It is part of the maple family and is known for its distinctive yellow leaves. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acer circinatum f. fulvum was mainly introduced to enhance ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its vibrant fall coloration. It is commonly found in regions with temperate climates, particularly in the Pacific Northwest of North America. This cultivar is favored for its unique yellow to orange foliage, which stands out against the typical red hues of the parent species. It has been widely cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in both residential and public green spaces. However, it is important to note that its introduction may have ecological implications in non-native environments."
