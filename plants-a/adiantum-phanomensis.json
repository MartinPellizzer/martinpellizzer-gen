    "intro": "Adiantum phanomensis, commonly known as the Phantom fern, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, bi-lobed fronds that resemble delicate lace. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires high humidity and well-drained soil to flourish. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a sought-after specimen among botanists and plant enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range.",
