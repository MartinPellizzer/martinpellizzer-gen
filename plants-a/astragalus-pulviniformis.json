    "intro": "Astragalus pulviniformis, commonly known as the rounded milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive rounded seed pods and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow or pale purple flowers. Astragalus pulviniformis plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
