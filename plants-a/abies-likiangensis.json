    "intro": "Abies likiangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to the mountainous regions of southwestern China. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the branches. The tree produces cones that are typically reddish-brown and contain seeds covered in a thin, winged aril. It thrives in cool, moist climates at high altitudes, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies likiangensis is primarily native to the eastern and central regions of China, particularly in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. It grows in mountainous areas at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,500 meters. This species is commonly found in temperate forests with moist, well-drained soils. It is often associated with other coniferous species in mixed forests. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is adapted to the rugged terrain of its native habitat.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies likiangensis was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It is commonly found in the Himalayas and eastern Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan. This species is often used in reforestation efforts due to its ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions. Its introduction has helped in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in degraded landscapes. However, it requires careful management to avoid becoming invasive in non-native habitats."
