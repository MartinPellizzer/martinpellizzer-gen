    "intro": "Acrostichum scolopendrifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hakea, is a tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a member of the palms family (Arecaceae) and is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color.",
