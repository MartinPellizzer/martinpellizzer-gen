    "intro": "Astragalus carthlicus, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility through its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. However, it is considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and over-collection."
