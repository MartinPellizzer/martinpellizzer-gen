    "intro": "Aster miser var. myrtifolius, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved aster, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, daisy-like flowers in shades of white to pale blue, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
