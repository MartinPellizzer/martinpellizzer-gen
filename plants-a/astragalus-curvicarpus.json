    "intro": "Astragalus curvicarpus, commonly known as narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces distinctive, narrow, compound leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Astragalus curvicarpus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
