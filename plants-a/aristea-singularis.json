    "intro": "Aristea singularis, commonly known as the singular aristea, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Aristea singularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
