    "intro": "Avena nuda var. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to East Asia. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which develop into single-seeded spikelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
