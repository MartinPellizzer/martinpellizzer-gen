    "intro": "Agrimonia odorata var. procera, commonly known as tall agrimony, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, making it a striking addition to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by red, fuzzy seeds. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Agrimony is often found in dry meadows and rocky soils, and it has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine."
