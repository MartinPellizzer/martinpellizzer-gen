    "intro": "Agrostis divaricata, commonly known as slender bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted shoots with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often obscured by the foliage. Agrostis divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
