It is a perennial herb that thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dunes and coastal cliffs. The plant features a robust root system that helps stabilize sandy shores, and its leaves are gray-green with a fuzzy texture. It produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is adapted to harsh maritime environments and is considered an important part of coastal ecosystems.",
