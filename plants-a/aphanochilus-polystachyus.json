    "intro": "Aphanochilus polystachyus, commonly known as the Indian spikegrass, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, white to pale blue flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Aphanochilus polystachyus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
