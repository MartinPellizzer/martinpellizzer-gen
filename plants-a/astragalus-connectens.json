    "intro": "Astragalus connectens, commonly known as the western milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to reddish-purple flowers in late spring. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Astragalus connectens is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats."
