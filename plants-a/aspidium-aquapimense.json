    "intro": "Aspidium aquapimense, commonly known as the aquatic fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear in a compact, clustered form. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as ponds or streams. Its rhizomes are usually submerged or partially submerged, anchoring the plant in aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid environments."
