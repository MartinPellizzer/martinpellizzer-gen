    "intro": "Aspidopterys nutans f. longigemmis, commonly known as the long-stemmed spreading hibiscus, is a unique variant of the native Hawaiian hibiscus. It is characterized by its elongated, drooping stems and large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red and yellow. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy texture, and it produces distinctive, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
