    "intro": "Arenaria ursina, commonly known as the bear's ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Arenaria ursina is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
