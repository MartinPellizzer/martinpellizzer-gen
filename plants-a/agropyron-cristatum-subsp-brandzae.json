    "intro": "Agropyron cristatum subsp. brandzae, commonly known as the Brandzae needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicle-like inflorescences with spikelets that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in dry, rocky, and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects for stabilizing degraded soils."
