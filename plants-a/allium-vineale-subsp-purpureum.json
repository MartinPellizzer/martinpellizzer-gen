    "intro": "Allium vineale subsp. purpureum, commonly known as purple garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers in the summer. The plant is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its bulbs, which are smaller than those of common garlic, are edible but have a milder flavor. This subspecies is closely related to other allium species and is sometimes used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers."
