    "intro": "Apluda digitata, commonly known as the finger grass, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish flowers. Apluda digitata is often found in moist, open habitats such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and pointed, with a fibrous texture that contributes to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in wet environments."
