    "intro": "Alomia robinsoniana, commonly known as the Robinson's alomia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in shaded, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to habitat destruction, Alomia robinsoniana is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
