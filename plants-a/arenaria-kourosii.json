    "intro": "Arenaria kourosii, commonly known as the Kouroussa sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It typically forms dense mats of small, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of tiny white flowers during the summer months, which are arranged in dense, compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
