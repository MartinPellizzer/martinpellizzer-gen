    "intro": "Aconitum galectonum, commonly known as the Galician aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, sparsely branched stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in late summer, arranged in dense, conical clusters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, somewhat fuzzy texture. Aconitum galectonum contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic and requiring careful handling.",
