It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, three-awned flowers, which are characteristic of the genus Aristida. This species is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
