    "intro": "Aspalathus longipes, commonly known as the African red bush, is a shrub native to the Western and Eastern Cape provinces of South Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit, with reddish-brown stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, bean-like pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Aspalathus longipes is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as a source of herbal tea."
