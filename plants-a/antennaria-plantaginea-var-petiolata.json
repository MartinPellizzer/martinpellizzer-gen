    "intro": "Antennaria plantaginea var. petiolata, commonly known as the hairy willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with densely packed, leaf-like bracts that give it a unique appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its frost-resistant nature. This species thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
