    "intro": "Astrolepis laevis, commonly known as the smooth astrolepis, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces spores on the undersides of its leaves, which are released during the dry season. Astrolepis laevis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a unique and visually appealing addition to botanical gardens and collections."
