    "intro": "Aeschynanthus miniatus, commonly known as the miniature wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to western Africa, specifically Nigeria and Cameroon, where it grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tubular, brightly colored flowers, typically in shades of red and orange. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. Due to its unique appearance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
