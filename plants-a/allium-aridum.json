    "intro": "Allium aridum, commonly known as the desert onion, is a perennial bulbous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale purple flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its bulbs are often used in traditional medicine and as a culinary ingredient in some regions. Allium aridum plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitats."
