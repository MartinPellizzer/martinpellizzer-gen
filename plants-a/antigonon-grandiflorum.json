    "intro": "Antigonon grandiflorum, commonly known as the coral vine, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a climbing shrub that produces clusters of bright pink or red flowers, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in full sun to partial shade, preferring well-drained soil. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover fences or trellises. Antigonon grandiflorum is also known for its rapid growth and can be invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
