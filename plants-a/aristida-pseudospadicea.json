    "intro": "Aristida pseudospadicea, commonly known as the narrowleaf threeawn, is a grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spiky inflorescences that are often clustered at the tips of the stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
