It typically grows in rocky and mountainous environments. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches in the Andes. It is a rare species with a restricted natural range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Aa matthewsii was mainly introduced to areas with high elevation and cool, moist climates, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. This plant is commonly associated with specific microclimates that mimic its native environment. Its introduction has been documented in several regions where similar ecological conditions exist. However, its spread is limited due to its specific habitat requirements."
