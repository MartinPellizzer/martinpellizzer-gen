    "intro": "Aristolochia bracteata, commonly known as the broadleaf Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves and its unique, tubular flowers that resemble a pipe, often with a deep purple or greenish hue. The plant produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
