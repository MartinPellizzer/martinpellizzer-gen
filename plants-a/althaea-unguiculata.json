    "intro": "Althaea unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marshmallow, is a flowering plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Althaea unguiculata thrives in wet or moist environments, often found in swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its roots contain mucilage, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine for its soothing properties."
