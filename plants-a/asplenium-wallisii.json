    "intro": "Asplenium wallisii, commonly known as the wallisii spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its compact rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Asplenium wallisii is a hardy species that is relatively easy to care for in a humid indoor environment."
