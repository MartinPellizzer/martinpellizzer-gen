    "intro": "Acer ornatum f. miyajimense, commonly known as the Miyajima maple, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Japanese maple. It is characterized by its striking, finely cut foliage that displays vibrant shades of red, orange, and yellow during the autumn season. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in cool, moist climates and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its unique leaf structure and seasonal color changes make it a standout in horticultural collections. Due to its limited distribution and specific growing requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments.",
