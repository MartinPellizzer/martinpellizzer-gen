    "intro": "Androrchis \u00d7 koenighoferae, commonly known as the Koenighofer's orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Androrchis alpina and Androrchis maculata. It is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically exhibit a mix of purple and white hues. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions of Central Europe. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile soils. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
