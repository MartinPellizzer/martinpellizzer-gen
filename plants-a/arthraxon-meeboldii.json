It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
