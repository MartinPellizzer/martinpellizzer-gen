    "intro": "Arachnothryx educta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Leguminosae and is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by pod-like fruits. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
