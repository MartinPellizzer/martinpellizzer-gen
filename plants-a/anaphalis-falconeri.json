    "intro": "Anaphalis falconeri, commonly known as the Falconeri's fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is known for its woolly, silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
