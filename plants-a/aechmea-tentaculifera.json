    "intro": "Aechmea tentaculifera, commonly known as the Sword-tipped Pineapple Plant, is a bromeliad native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces a striking flower spike with vibrant red bracts that bloom in the spring. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil. Aechmea tentaculifera is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance."
