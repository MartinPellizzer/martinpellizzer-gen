It features tall, upright stems that bear narrow, grass-like leaves and umbels of small, purple-pink flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that are often used as ornamental plants in gardens due to their striking color and foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, preferring temperate climates. Allium atropurpureum is also valued for its edible bulbs, which have a mild, sweet flavor."
