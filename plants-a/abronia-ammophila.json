    "intro": "Abronia ammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal dunes of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with high salt exposure. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Abronia ammophila plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune systems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abronia ammophila is primarily native to Wyoming. This plant is found in the arid and semi-arid regions of the state, particularly in areas with sandy or gravelly soils. It thrives in open habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and disturbed sites. The species is adapted to the dry climate and can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations. Its limited distribution makes it a rare and ecologically significant plant in Wyoming.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abronia ammophila was mainly introduced to coastal dunes and sandy soils where it can thrive in well-drained conditions. It is often found in areas with minimal vegetation, preferring full sun exposure. This plant has been reported in several coastal regions, including parts of the southeastern United States. Its introduction has been associated with human activity, such as coastal development and landscaping. However, its ecological impact remains largely understudied."
