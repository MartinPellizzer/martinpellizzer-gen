    "intro": "Aspidopterys ovata, commonly known as the New Zealand tree fern, is a towering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk that is covered in a fibrous, spongy material called the rachis. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones called strobili, which are typically located at the base of the plant. Aspidopterys ovata is well adapted to the moist, temperate climate of its native habitat and plays an important ecological role in its environment."
