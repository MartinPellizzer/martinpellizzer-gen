    "intro": "Astragalus spatulatus var. uniflorus, commonly known as the single-flower milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, compound leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces a single, showy violet or blue-purple flower at the tip of each stem, which blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its adaptability to arid environments."
