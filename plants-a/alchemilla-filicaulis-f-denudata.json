    "intro": "Alchemilla filicaulis f. denudata, commonly known as the naked leaf lady's mantle, is a variant of the alchemilla genus characterized by its reduced foliage. This plant features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often more sparse than in the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded environments with minimal maintenance."
