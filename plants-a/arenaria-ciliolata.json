    "intro": "Arenaria ciliolata, commonly known as the silky sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers in early summer, which are often arranged in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
