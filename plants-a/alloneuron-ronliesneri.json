    "intro": "Alloneuron ronliesneri, commonly known as the Ronliesner's alloneuron, is a rare and enigmatic plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the late spring and early summer. It is native to a specific region in South America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
