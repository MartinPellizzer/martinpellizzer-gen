    "intro": "Aristida adscensionis var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island wiregrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as coastal areas and rocky slopes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid or Mediterranean climates."
