    "intro": "Atriplex torreyi var. torreyi, commonly known as desert saltbush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, spine-like leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Its salt-tolerant nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
