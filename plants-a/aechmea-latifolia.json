    "intro": "Aechmea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf urn plant, is a striking bromeliad native to South America. It is characterized by its wide, waxy, and often brightly colored leaves that form a rosette shape, creating a central cup that collects rainwater. The plant produces tall flower spikes with vibrant red or orange bracts, which are followed by small white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea latifolia is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
