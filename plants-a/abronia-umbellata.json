    "intro": "Abronia umbellata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal dunes and arid landscapes. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Abronia umbellata plays an important role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators.",
