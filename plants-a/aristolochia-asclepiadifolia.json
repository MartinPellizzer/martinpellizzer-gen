    "intro": "Aristolochia asclepiadifolia, commonly known as the Mexican Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Central America and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and thrives in humid, tropical environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant is known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal medicine. However, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with caution."
