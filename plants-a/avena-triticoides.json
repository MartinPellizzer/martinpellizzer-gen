    "intro": "Avena triticoides, commonly known as wild oat, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelet-like inflorescence. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, awned grains. Wild oat is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological and agricultural studies."
