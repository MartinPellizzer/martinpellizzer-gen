    "intro": "Aconitum \u00d7 versicolor, commonly known as the hybrid monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its striking, hood-shaped flowers that typically range in color from blue to purple, with a contrasting yellow or orange marking at the base. The plant features large, palmately compound leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a fine, waxy coating. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, it thrives in well-drained, moist soils and partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value.",
