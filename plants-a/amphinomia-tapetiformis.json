It possesses a soft, gelatinous body with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. The tentacles are equipped with nematocysts, specialized cells used for capturing prey and defense. Its coloration can vary, often appearing in shades of brown or reddish, depending on the environment. This species plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the food web and providing habitat for small organisms."
