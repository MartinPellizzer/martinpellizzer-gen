    "intro": "Acer pubinerve, commonly known as the pubescent maple, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its palmately lobed leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by winged seeds called samaras. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming more fissured with age. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and seasonal changes.",
