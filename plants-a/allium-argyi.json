    "intro": "Allium argyi, commonly known as the Korean garlic chive, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hollow stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by bulb-like structures that are edible. Allium argyi is often cultivated for its mild garlic flavor and ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to temperate climates."
