    "intro": "Andicolea lucida, commonly known as the shining moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, acrocarpous moss that typically grows on moist, shaded rock surfaces in temperate regions. The plant has a delicate, leafy structure with bright green, lance-shaped leaves that are often curled at the tips. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it an indicator species for rocky, acidic substrates. The reproductive structures, or capsules, are borne on slender stalks and release spores when mature."
