    "intro": "Acanthus seretii, commonly known as the African spurge, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Acanthus seretii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus seretii is primarily native to DR Congo, Sudan, and South Sudan. This plant is found in the tropical and subtropical regions of these countries. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and riverine habitats. The species is well adapted to the humid climate and rich soils of its native range. It plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus seretii was mainly introduced to coastal and rocky habitats in the Mediterranean region. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight along cliffs and shores. This plant is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and abandoned fields, where it can establish itself quickly. Its presence has been noted in several countries including Italy, Greece, and Spain. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential impact on native plant communities."
