This variety is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils with moderate moisture levels. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous florets. The seeds, which are the primary product, are rich in nutrients such as protein, fiber, and minerals.
