    "intro": "Agiella angolensis, commonly known as the Angola agiella, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Agiella angolensis is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
