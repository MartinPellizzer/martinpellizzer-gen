    "intro": "Althoffia tetrapyxis, commonly known as the four-angled water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem. The plant has a unique structure with four prominent ribs on its fronds, giving it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, often found in swampy areas. Althoffia tetrapyxis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
