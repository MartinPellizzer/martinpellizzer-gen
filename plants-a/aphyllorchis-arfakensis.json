    "intro": "Aphyllorchis arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the highlands of Indonesia. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that is often brightly colored. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to conserve moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
