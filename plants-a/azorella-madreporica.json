    "intro": "Azorella madreporica, commonly known as the cushion plant, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family, native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It forms dense, low-growing cushions composed of tightly packed, woody stems and leaves that help it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant is adapted to nutrient-poor soils and can endure extreme temperature fluctuations and strong winds. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems. Due to its slow growth and vulnerability to climate change, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude habitats."
