    "intro": "Alexgeorgea ganopoda, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of native trees and shrubs. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange and contain one or two seeds. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects, while also drawing nutrients from its host."
