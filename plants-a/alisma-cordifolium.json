    "intro": "Alisma cordifolium, commonly known as water plantain, is a wetland plant characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and flowering spikes. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant has smooth, glossy leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. Alisma cordifolium is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for aquatic life."
