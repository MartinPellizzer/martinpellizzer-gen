    "intro": "Allium angulosum var. palustre, commonly known as swamp garlic, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its bulbs are edible and have a mild garlic flavor, though they are less commonly cultivated than other Allium species. This variety is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
