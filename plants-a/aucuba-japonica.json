    "intro": "Aucuba japonica, commonly known as Japanese aucuba, is a broad-leaved evergreen shrub native to East Asia. It features thick, waxy, dark green foliage with prominent yellow veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardiness. Aucuba japonica is also valued for its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions and air pollution."
