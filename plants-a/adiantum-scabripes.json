    "intro": "Adiantum scabripes, commonly known as the rusty maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with a distinctive rusty coloration on the underside. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its fronds are bipinnate, meaning they are divided into smaller segments, giving it a finely divided appearance. Adiantum scabripes is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal.",
