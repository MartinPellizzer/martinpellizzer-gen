    "intro": "Agrostis stolonifera var. minor, commonly known as slender meadowgrass, is a cool-season grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lawns, meadows, and disturbed sites. Due to its hardiness and adaptability, it is sometimes used in turfgrass mixes and ecological restoration projects."
