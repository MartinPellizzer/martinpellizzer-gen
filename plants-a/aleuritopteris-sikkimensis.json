    "intro": "Aleuritopteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim cliff fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its robust, leathery fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate, with a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant thrives in rocky, shaded environments and is often found growing on cliffs or in forested areas. Its spores are released from sori that are arranged in a single row on the underside of the fronds. Aleuritopteris sikkimensis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
