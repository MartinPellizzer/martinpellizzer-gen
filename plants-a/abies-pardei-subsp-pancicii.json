    "intro": "Abies pardei subsp. pancicii, commonly known as the Pancici's fir, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its slender, conical shape and dark green, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish wax. The cones of this subspecies are typically reddish-brown and mature to release seeds in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in mixed forests at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies pardei subsp. pancicii is primarily native to the mountainous regions of the western Balkans, including parts of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, and Serbia. This subspecies is typically found in high-altitude forests, often in association with other coniferous species. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils, often in areas with significant snow cover during the winter months. The distribution of this subspecies is limited to specific ecological niches, making it a rare and localized species. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies pardei subsp. pancicii was mainly introduced to areas with cool, moist climates and well-drained soils, typically found in mountainous regions. It thrives in elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters, where it forms dense forests or grows as part of mixed coniferous stands. This subspecies is particularly adapted to acidic soils and is often found in association with other fir species such as Abies alba and Abies pinsapo. Its introduction has been noted in parts of Europe, especially in the Carpathian Basin, where it has established itself in natural and semi-natural habitats. Due to its ecological preferences, it is considered a valuable component of boreal and subalpine ecosystems."
