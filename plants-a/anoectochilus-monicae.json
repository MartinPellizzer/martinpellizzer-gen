    "intro": "Anoectochilus monicae, commonly known as the Monica's slipper orchid, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the high-altitude cloud forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, slipper-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, shaded habitat. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps in maximizing light absorption. Anoectochilus monicae is highly sought after by orchid enthusiasts due to its aesthetic appeal and conservation status."
