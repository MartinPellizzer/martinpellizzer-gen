    "intro": "Antennaria rosea var. imbricata, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, pink to rose-colored flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit with hairy, prostrate stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are linear, hairy, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is well adapted to sandy and rocky soils, thriving in coastal environments with full sun exposure."
