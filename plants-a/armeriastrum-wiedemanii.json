    "intro": "Armeriastrum wiedemanii, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. It produces tiny, pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Armeriastrum wiedemanii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
