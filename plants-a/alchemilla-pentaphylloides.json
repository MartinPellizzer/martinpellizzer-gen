It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
