    "intro": "Andropogon armatus, commonly known as the armed grass or tall bluestem, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Andropogon armatus is often found in prairies, open woodlands, and along roadsides, playing a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for wildlife."
