    "intro": "Aegilops speltoides var. polyathera, commonly known as the slender wild wheat, is a diploid grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces awnless spikelets with two to three florets, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an important wild relative of cultivated wheat. This species is valued for its potential in genetic research and breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability."
