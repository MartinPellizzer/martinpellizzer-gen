    "intro": "Alchemilla pubescens proles vetteri, commonly known as the velvet cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, velvety appearance, and its leaves are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wet meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
