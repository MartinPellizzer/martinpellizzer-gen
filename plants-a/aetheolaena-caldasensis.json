It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered yellowish flowers. It is often found in cloud forests and is adapted to the cooler, humid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
