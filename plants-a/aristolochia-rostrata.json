    "intro": "Aristolochia rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pipe-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with a distinctive, intricate pattern. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often lobed, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
