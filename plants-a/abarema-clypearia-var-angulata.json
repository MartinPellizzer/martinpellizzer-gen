It is found in the states of Par\u00e1, Amap\u00e1, and Maranh\u00e3o in the northeastern region of the country. This plant thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils. It is commonly found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological zones within its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abarema clypearia var. angulata was mainly introduced to areas with tropical and subtropical climates, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in regions of South America, particularly in Brazil, where it has been cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant is often used in landscaping due to its attractive foliage and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions. Its introduction has been largely driven by horticultural interest rather than ecological necessity. However, it is important to monitor its spread to prevent potential impacts on native ecosystems."
