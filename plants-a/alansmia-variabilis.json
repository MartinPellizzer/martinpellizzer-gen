It belongs to the family Polemoniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat.
