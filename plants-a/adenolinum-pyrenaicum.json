    "intro": "Adenolinum pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean adenolinum, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the Pyrenees mountain range. It is a small, herbaceous plant with narrow, linear leaves and produces small, white or pale green flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements make it highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species.",
