    "intro": "Aechmea fernandae, commonly known as the Fernandae bromeliad, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored bracts that range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Aechmea fernandae is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
