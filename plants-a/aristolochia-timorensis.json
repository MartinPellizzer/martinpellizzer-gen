    "intro": "Aristolochia timorensis, commonly known as the Timor Dutchman's pipe, is a climbing vine native to Indonesia. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, tubular, and often fragrant flowers. The plant produces heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and is typically found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and the plant contains aristolochic acids, which are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its medicinal and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though its use is limited due to its harmful properties."
