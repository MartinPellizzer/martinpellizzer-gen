    "intro": "Allium nigrum var. atropurpureum, commonly known as purple bulb onion, is a variant of the common onion characterized by its deep purple to almost black bulbs. This plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is native to southern Europe and western Asia. Its leaves are hollow, grass-like, and typically have a mild onion scent, while the bulbs are used in cooking for their subtle flavor. The flowers are small, white or pale purple, and form in a loose umbel, adding ornamental value to the plant. It is often cultivated for both its edible bulbs and its aesthetic appeal in gardens."
