    "intro": "Alchemilla emarginata, commonly known as the lesser lady's mantle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shady garden areas. Alchemilla emarginata is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
