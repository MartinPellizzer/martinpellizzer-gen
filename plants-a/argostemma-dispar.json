    "intro": "Argostemma dispar, commonly known as the narrow-leaved argostemma, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, often with five petals. Its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its morphology and ecological role. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, making it a common understory plant in forests."
