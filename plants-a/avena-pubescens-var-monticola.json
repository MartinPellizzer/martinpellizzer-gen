    "intro": "Avena pubescens var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain oat, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, hairy stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, making it a hardy plant in mountainous regions."
