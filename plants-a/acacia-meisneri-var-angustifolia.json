    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia meisneri var. angustifolia is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in countries such as Namibia, Botswana, and parts of South Africa. This variety is commonly found in sandy soils and rocky outcrops, thriving in environments with low rainfall and high temperatures. It is often associated with savanna and shrubland habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in other regions with similar climatic conditions.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia meisneri var. angustifolia was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and reforestation projects due to its attractive foliage and adaptability to various soil conditions. It is commonly found in regions with mild climates, where it serves as a decorative plant in gardens and parks. This variety is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soils, making it useful for land stabilization and erosion control. However, its introduction has raised concerns about potential invasiveness in non-native environments. Despite these concerns, it remains a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration efforts."
