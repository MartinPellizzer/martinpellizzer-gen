    "intro": "Adiantum pedatum f. laciniatum, commonly known as the notched maidenhair fern, is a fern species characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. It features feather-like leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas. Its fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in nighttime pollination. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and greenhouses.",
