    "intro": "Acicarpha procumbens var. genuina, commonly known as the slender everlasting pea, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Acicarpha procumbens var. genuina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.",
