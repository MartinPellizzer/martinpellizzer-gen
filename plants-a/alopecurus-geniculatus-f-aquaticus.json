    "intro": "Alopecurus geniculatus f. aquaticus, commonly known as the water bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to wetland environments. This plant is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. The inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers that produce wind-pollinated seeds. Its botanical features make it well adapted to aquatic conditions, though it can also survive in slightly brackish environments."
