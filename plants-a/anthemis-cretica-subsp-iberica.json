    "intro": "Anthemis cretica subsp. iberica, commonly known as Iberian cudweed, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of linear to oblanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disk florets, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in southern Europe."
