    "intro": "Astragalus fetidus, commonly known as stinking milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
