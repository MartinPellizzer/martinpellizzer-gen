    "intro": "Altensteinia nubigena, commonly known as the cloud fern, is a rare and enigmatic fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble clouds, hence its common name. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often growing in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Altensteinia nubigena is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of scientific interest."
