    "intro": "Anthurium seamayense, commonly known as the Seaway Anthurium, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, heart-shaped leaves that can range in color from deep green to almost black. The plant produces spadices, which are specialized inflorescences that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. Anthurium seamayense thrives in humid, warm environments and requires indirect light to flourish. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
