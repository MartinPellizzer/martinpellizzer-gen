    "intro": "Aster glacialis, commonly known as the glacier aster, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage that helps it retain heat in cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or alpine settings. Aster glacialis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh environmental conditions."
