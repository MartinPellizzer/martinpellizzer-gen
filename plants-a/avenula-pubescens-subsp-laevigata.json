    "intro": "Avenula pubescens subsp. laevigata, commonly known as the smooth-leaved avenula, is a perennial grass species native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smooth and glabrous. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
