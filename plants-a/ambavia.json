It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 12,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ambavia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ability to cascade from hanging baskets or trellises."
