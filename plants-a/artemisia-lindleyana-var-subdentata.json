    "intro": "Artemisia lindleyana var. subdentata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sagebrush, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage with narrow, linear leaves that have a distinctive subdenticulate margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are clustered in panicles, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Its resilience to drought and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
