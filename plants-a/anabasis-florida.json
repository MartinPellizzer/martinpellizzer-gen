    "intro": "Anabasis florida, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Anabasis florida is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
