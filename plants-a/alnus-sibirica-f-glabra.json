    "intro": "Alnus sibirica f. glabra, commonly known as the smooth Siberian alder, is a shrub or small tree native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish catkins in early spring, which are its primary means of reproduction. It is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in forest edges, riverbanks, and disturbed sites. This species is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
