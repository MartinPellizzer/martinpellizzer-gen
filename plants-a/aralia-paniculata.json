    "intro": "Aralia paniculata, commonly known as the American aralia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in large, umbrella-like clusters called panicles, which appear in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but generally not for humans. Aralia paniculata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
