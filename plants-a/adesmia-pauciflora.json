It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typical of many legumes. It thrives in dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Adesmia pauciflora plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats.",
