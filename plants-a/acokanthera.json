    "intro": "Acokanthera, commonly known as the poison arrow tree, is a genus of flowering plants native to tropical Africa. These plants are characterized by their dark, woody stems and opposite, simple leaves. The flowers are typically small and clustered in inflorescences, often with showy bracts. Acokanthera species produce toxic alkaloids, which have been used by indigenous peoples for making poison-tipped arrows. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value despite their poisonous nature."
