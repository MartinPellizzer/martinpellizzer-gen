    "intro": "Agrostis vulgaris var. mutica, commonly known as hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and dense, carpet-like growth habit, making it a common weed in lawns and agricultural fields. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it both a useful forage crop and a challenging weed to control."
