    "intro": "Andrachne rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy, round leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces tiny white or pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats. Andrachne rotundifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
