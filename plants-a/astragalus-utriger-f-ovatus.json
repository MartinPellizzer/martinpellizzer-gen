It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to pale purple flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters. Its fruit is a legume pod that dehisces to release small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
