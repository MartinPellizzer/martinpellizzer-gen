    "intro": "Astragalus bisulcatus var. haydenianus, commonly known as the Hayden's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are compound, with several pairs of leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its role in supporting local pollinators and its resilience in harsh climates."
