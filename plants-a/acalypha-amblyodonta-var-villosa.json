    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. villosa is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It is commonly found in lowland tropical rainforests and secondary growth areas. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often associated with riverine and coastal vegetation. It is also present in parts of northern Australia and New Guinea. The species is known for its distinctive hairy foliage and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha amblyodonta var. villosa was mainly introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique appearance. It was likely brought there during the 19th or early 20th century by horticulturists and gardeners seeking exotic species for cultivation. Despite its ornamental value, it has since become naturalized in certain regions, raising concerns about its potential impact on native ecosystems. The plant is now considered a potential weed in some areas, particularly in coastal and disturbed habitats. Its spread highlights the importance of monitoring introduced species for ecological consequences."
