    "intro": "Artanthe rudis, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically hairy, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Artanthe rudis is often found in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky slopes. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
