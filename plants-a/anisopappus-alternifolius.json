It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant has linear, alternate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation in arid environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it well adapted to desert conditions."
