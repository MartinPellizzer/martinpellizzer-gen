It thrives in specific habitats within these areas. The plant is adapted to the local climate and soil conditions of its native range. Its distribution is limited to these regions, making it a regionally significant species.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acalypha burquezii was mainly introduced to the Hawaiian Islands. It is considered an invasive species in the region. The plant spreads rapidly through its prolific seed production. It often outcompetes native vegetation, leading to habitat degradation. Efforts are being made to control its spread and protect local ecosystems."
