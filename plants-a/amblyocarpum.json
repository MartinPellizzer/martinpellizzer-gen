    "intro": "Amblyocarpum, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to regions of southern Africa. The plants are perennial herbs with basal leaves that are often lance-shaped or ovate. They produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and their fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Amblyocarpum species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas."
