It features large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to 2 meters in length, giving it a dramatic appearance. The plant produces strikingly colorful spadices, which are the inflorescences that house the true flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near water bodies. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant in warmer climates."
