    "intro": "Alyssum collinum, commonly known as coastal alyssum, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local pollinators. Alyssum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in coastal ecosystems."
