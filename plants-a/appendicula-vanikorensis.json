It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in coastal or island habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a smooth, waxy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
