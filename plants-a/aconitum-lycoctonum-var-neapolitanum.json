    "intro": "Aconitum lycoctonum var. neapolitanum, commonly known as the Neapolitan monkshood, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It features striking blue to purple spurred flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has palmate leaves with deeply indented lobes, and its stems are typically unbranched and somewhat hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it should be handled with care and is not recommended for cultivation in areas with small children or pets.",
