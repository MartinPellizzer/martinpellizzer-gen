    "intro": "Aichryson tortuosum var. bethencourtianum, commonly known as the Bethencourt's ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features compact, branching stems covered in dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
