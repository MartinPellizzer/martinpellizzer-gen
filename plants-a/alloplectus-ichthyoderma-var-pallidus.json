    "intro": "Alloplectus ichthyoderma var. pallidus, commonly known as the pale ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a unique floral structure that facilitates pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat destruction and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
