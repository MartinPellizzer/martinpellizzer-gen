    "intro": "Allium arampatzisii, commonly known as the Arampatzis' onion, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Cyprus. It is characterized by its bulbous base and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the dry, Mediterranean climate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation status."
