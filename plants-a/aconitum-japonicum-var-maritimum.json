    "intro": "Aconitum japonicum var. maritimum, commonly known as the sea aconite, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Japan. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, adapting to saline and wind-exposed environments. The plant features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer, arranged in tall, sparsely branched spikes. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, toxic aroma. This variety is part of the Ranunculaceae family and contains potent alkaloids, making it highly toxic to both humans and animals.",
