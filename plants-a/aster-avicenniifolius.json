    "intro": "Aster avicenniifolius, commonly known as the sand aster, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to withstand drought conditions. The sand aster plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
