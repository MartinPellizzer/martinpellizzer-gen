    "intro": "Alsine polycarpa, commonly known as the many-fruited sandplant, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Mallow family (Malvaceae). It is a low-growing annual herb that typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, followed by capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Alsine polycarpa is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion."
