    "intro": "Astragalus epiglottis f. asperulus, commonly known as the rough epiglottis milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its distinctive feature is the rough, hairy texture of its leaves and stems, which gives it the specific epithet \"asperulus.\" This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological adaptations and potential medicinal properties."
