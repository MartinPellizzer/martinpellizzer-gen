    "intro": "Acanthus longibracteatus, commonly known as the long-bract acanthus, is a striking evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, spiky inflorescences with small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its robust growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Acanthus longibracteatus is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soils, thriving in Mediterranean climates.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acanthus longibracteatus is primarily native to Myanmar. It is commonly found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the country. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along riverbanks. It is well adapted to the warm and humid climate of Myanmar. Its natural habitat includes both lowland and hill forest environments.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acanthus longibracteatus was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture and landscape design due to its striking foliage and architectural form. It is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's introduction has led to its establishment in some non-native areas, where it can sometimes become invasive. Its popularity is driven by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to different climatic conditions. However, its spread outside of controlled environments requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
