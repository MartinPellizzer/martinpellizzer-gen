    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abies novae-angliae is primarily native to the northeastern United States, specifically New England. It is found in regions such as Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and parts of Massachusetts. This species thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soils. It is commonly found in mixed hardwood-conifer forests and along river valleys. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abies novae-angliae was mainly introduced to ornamental horticulture due to its attractive appearance and adaptability to various climates. It is commonly found in gardens and landscaped areas in regions with temperate to subarctic climates. The plant is valued for its conical shape, dark green foliage, and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not properly managed. Its distribution has expanded beyond its native range in North America due to human activity and cultivation efforts."
