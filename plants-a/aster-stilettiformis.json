    "intro": "Aster stilettiformis, commonly known as the needle-leaf aster, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its flowers are usually blue to purple in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Aster stilettiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in pollinator habitats in its native environment."
