    "intro": "Astragalus secretus, commonly known as the secret milkvetch, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant has compound leaves with small leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
