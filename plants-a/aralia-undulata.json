It is characterized by its compound leaves that have a wavy or undulating edge, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by berries that are edible for some wildlife. The plant has a fibrous root system and can reach heights of up to six feet."
