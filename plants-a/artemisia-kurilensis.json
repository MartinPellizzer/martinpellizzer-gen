    "intro": "Artemisia kurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of northeastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and mountainous regions. The plant features slender, aromatic stems and gray-green, feathery leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in late summer, and it produces tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Artemisia kurilensis is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
