    "intro": "Andromachia, commonly known as the moonflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. These plants are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and Mexico. They are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that typically open at night, emitting a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. The leaves are usually opposite and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Andromachia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits."
