    "intro": "Alsophila alticola, commonly known as the cloud forest huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is native to the tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines. This plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its humid habitat. Alsophila alticola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
