    "intro": "Asplenium \u00d7 stiriacum, commonly known as the hybrid maidenhair fern, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Asplenium trichomanes and Asplenium scolopendrium. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of its parent species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds. Asplenium \u00d7 stiriacum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic qualities."
