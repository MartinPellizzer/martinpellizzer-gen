    "intro": "Aspidium calcaratum, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to various regions of the world, including parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are typically divided into lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest floors. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium calcaratum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and aesthetic qualities."
