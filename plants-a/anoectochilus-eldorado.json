    "intro": "Anoectochilus eldorado, commonly known as the Eldorado orchid, is a rare and highly sought-after species native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, sympodial growth habit and striking, dark green to purple-tinged leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its montane forest ecosystem."
