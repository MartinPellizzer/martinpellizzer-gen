    "intro": "Allium minutiflorum, commonly known as the dwarf onion or small-flowered garlic, is a species of flowering plant in the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers arranged in a dense umbel, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are grass-like and form a basal rosette, and the plant is often used in rock gardens due to its ornamental value. Allium minutiflorum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in culinary applications."
