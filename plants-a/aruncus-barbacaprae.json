It features striking, feathery plumes of white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has long, slender leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its unique appearance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
