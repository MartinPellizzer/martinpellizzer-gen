    "intro": "Amygdalus \u00d7 vavilovii f. amara, commonly known as the wild almond hybrid, is a botanical species that exhibits characteristics of both Prunus dulcis (sweet almond) and Prunus amygdalus var. amara (bitter almond). It is a naturally occurring hybrid that thrives in temperate climates, particularly in regions with well-drained soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that contain hard, bitter seeds, which are not typically used for culinary purposes. Its genetic makeup makes it a valuable subject in botanical research, especially in the study of almond domestication and genetic diversity. The species is also noted for its ornamental value, with attractive spring blossoms that add aesthetic appeal to gardens."
