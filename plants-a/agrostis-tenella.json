    "intro": "Agrostis tenella, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and fields. The plant has fine, grass-like leaves that are often covered with a dense layer of hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Agrostis tenella is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in erosion control and as a forage crop."
