    "intro": "Apocynum, commonly known as dogbane, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their milky sap, which is often toxic and can cause skin irritation. They typically have opposite leaves and produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or yellow. The genus includes several species, such as Apocynum cannabinum, which is native to North America. Many Apocynum species are used in traditional medicine, though their use is often limited due to their toxic properties."
