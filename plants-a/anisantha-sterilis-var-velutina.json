    "intro": "Anisantha sterilis var. velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Velvetleaf is often found in disturbed soils and can become a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and extensive root system. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
