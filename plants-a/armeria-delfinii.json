    "intro": "Armeria delfinii, commonly known as the dwarf thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It produces dense clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ability to withstand salt spray make it well-suited for maritime environments."
