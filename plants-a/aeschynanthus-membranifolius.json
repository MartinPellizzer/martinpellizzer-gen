    "intro": "Aeschynanthus membranifolius, commonly known as the velvet tangerine. This evergreen shrub is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white and pink, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Aeschynanthus membranifolius is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and unique floral display."
