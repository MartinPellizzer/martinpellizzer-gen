    "intro": "Arthrostemma capitatum, commonly known as the clustered arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged in water, adapting to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a dense, terminal cluster. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wetland environments. Arthrostemma capitatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in wetland restoration."
