    "intro": "Astronidium muscosum var. muscosum, commonly known as the velvetleaf sterculia, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in warm climates for its attractive foliage."
