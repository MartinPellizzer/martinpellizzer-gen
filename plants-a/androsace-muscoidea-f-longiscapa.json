    "intro": "Androsace muscoidea f. longiscapa, commonly known as the long-stemmed moss campion, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, arranged in clusters atop slender stems. The leaves are generally ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are often covered in a fine layer of white, woolly hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it forms dense mats. Its botanical structure is well-adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient component of mountainous flora."
