It belongs to the family Chenopodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features wiry, spiny stems covered in small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in arid and coastal environments, often found on sand dunes and rocky shores. Aciphylla flexuosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife.",
