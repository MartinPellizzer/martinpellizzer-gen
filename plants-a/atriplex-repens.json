    "intro": "Atriplex repens, commonly known as saltbush, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small perennial plant that typically grows in saline or alkaline soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its small green flowers are borne in clusters and are often followed by small, edible seeds. Atriplex repens is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and is used in restoration ecology."
