    "intro": "Aglossorrhyncha lucida var. wariana, commonly known as the Wariana ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically light green with a slight sheen. The plant's spores are borne on the underside of its fertile fronds, which are often smaller and more compact than the sterile fronds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
