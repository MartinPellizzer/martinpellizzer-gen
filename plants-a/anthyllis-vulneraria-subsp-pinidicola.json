    "intro": "Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. pinidicola, commonly known as the coastal anthyllis, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along dunes and cliffs where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ability to stabilize coastal soils and support local biodiversity."
