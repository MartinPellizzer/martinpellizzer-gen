    "intro": "Amorphophallus sylvaticus, commonly known as the giant swamp taro, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves and a striking, often foul-smelling inflorescence that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies or in swampy areas. Its underground corm serves as a storage organ, allowing it to survive periods of drought. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to regenerate from its corm after being cut or damaged."
