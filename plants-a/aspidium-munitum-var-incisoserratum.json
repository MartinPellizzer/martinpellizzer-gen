    "intro": "Aspidium munitum var. incisoserratum, commonly known as the serrated wood fern, is a variant of the wood fern species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a perennial fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are deeply divided and serrated, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense colonies. The spores are released from sporangia located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in woodland ecosystems."
