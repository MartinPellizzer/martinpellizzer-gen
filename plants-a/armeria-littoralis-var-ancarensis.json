    "intro": "Armeria littoralis var. ancarensis, commonly known as the coastal thrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky coastlines of southern California and Baja California. It features dense clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has fleshy, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong coastal winds. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
