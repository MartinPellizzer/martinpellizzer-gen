    "intro": "Angophora intermedia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved manna gum, is a deciduous tree native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, flaky bark and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, pinkish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. It is often found in coastal and dry sclerophyll forest communities, and it plays an important role in local ecosystems."
