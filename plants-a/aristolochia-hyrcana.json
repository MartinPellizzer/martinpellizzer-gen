    "intro": "Aristolochia hyrcana, commonly known as the Persian birthwort, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia and parts of the Middle East. It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and distinctive, hollow, pipe-like flowers that are often purple or greenish in color. The plant contains various bioactive compounds, some of which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by specific insect species, and it thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. However, it is important to note that some species within the Aristolochia genus contain toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
