It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its lanceolate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Aspidium glaberrimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and greenhouses."
