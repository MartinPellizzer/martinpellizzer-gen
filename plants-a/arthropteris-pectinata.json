    "intro": "Arthropteris pectinata, commonly known as the cinnamon fern, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its distinctive, arching fronds that are covered in soft, cinnamon-colored spore cases. The plant has a short, thick rhizome that supports its tall, slender stalk. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with a basal cluster of sterile fronds and a terminal fertile frond. Arthropteris pectinata thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
