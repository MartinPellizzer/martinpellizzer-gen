    "intro": "Alchemilla waltersii, commonly known as Walter's lady's mantle, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Walter's lady's mantle thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
