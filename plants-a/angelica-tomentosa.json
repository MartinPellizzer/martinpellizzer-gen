    "intro": "Angelica tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly angelica, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and tall, branched stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its root system is thick and fleshy, often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Angelica tomentosa thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks."
