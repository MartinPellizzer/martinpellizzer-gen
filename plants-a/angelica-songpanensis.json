    "intro": "Angelica songpanensis, commonly known as the Songpan angelica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots, parsley, and celery, and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported digestive and anti-inflammatory properties. Angelica songpanensis thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat."
