    "intro": "Aeonium urbicum subsp. urbicum, commonly known as the rock rose aeonium, is a succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina. The plant produces tall, branching stems that bear clusters of small, yellow flowers in the spring. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
