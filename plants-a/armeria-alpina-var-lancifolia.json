    "intro": "Armeria alpina var. lancifolia, commonly known as the Alpine thrift, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces dense clusters of white or pinkish flowers in early spring. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
