It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and heart-shaped leaves with a dark green upper surface. The plant produces small, yellow-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, fuzzy berries that ripen in late summer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential use in horticulture and conservation efforts.",
