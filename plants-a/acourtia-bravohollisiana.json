    "intro": "Acourtia bravohollisiana, commonly known as the San Benito sage, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage and showy purple-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. It is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species.",
