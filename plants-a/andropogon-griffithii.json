    "intro": "Andropogon griffithii, commonly known as Indian switchgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. This plant typically grows in moist to wet environments, such as marshes and riverbanks, and is well adapted to seasonal flooding. Its flowering inflorescence consists of a panicle made up of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Andropogon griffithii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
