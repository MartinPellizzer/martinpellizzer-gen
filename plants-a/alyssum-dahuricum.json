    "intro": "Alyssum dahuricum, commonly known as Siberian alyssum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with numerous small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Alyssum dahuricum is also valued for its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
