    "intro": "Aspidium meniscioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in freshwater environments. The plant's rhizomes are often rooted in the substrate, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Aspidium meniscioides is often found in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
