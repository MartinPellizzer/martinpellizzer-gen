    "intro": "Apinella seseliodes, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, is a distinguishing feature. Apinella seseliodes plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies, despite its defensive properties."
