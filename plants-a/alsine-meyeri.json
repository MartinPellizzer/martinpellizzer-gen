    "intro": "Alsine meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's alsike, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are encased in a hard, smooth capsule, typical of the Caryophyllaceae family. Alsine meyeri is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
