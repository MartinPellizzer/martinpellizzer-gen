    "intro": "Archangiopteris hokouensis, commonly known as the Hokouensis water fern, is a rare species of aquatic fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Marsileaceae and is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. The plant thrives in freshwater environments with still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
