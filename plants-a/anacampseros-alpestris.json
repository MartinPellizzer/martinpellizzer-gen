    "intro": "Anacampseros alpestris, commonly known as the alpine stonecress, is a succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, upright stems. Anacampseros alpestris is adapted to rocky and alpine soils, thriving in full sun and cool climates."
