    "intro": "Aspidium cristatum, commonly known as the crested water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed fronds that often have a crinkled or curled appearance, giving it its common name. Native to regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and India, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. Aspidium cristatum is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its unique foliage and adaptability to various growing conditions."
