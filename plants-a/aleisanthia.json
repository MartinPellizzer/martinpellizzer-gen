These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Aleisanthia species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in moist, shaded environments. The leaves are usually ovate or elliptical with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The fruits are fleshy berries that contain several seeds, contributing to the plant's reproductive strategy."
