    "intro": "Arisaema griffithii var. pradhanii, commonly known as the Pradhan's arrowhead, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant features heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in mountainous regions with cool, humid climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
