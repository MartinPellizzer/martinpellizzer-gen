    "intro": "Anthericum maculatum, commonly known as the spotted lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, grass-like leaves that are often spotted with silver or white markings. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical name reflects its distinctive spotted foliage, which is a key identifying feature."
