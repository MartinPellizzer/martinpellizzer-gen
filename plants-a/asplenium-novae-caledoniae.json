    "intro": "Asplenium novae-caledoniae, commonly known as the New Caledonia maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Aspleniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble the shape of a maidenhair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the humid conditions. Its rhizomes are creeping and help it spread across the forest floor, forming dense mats. The leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant retain moisture in its native habitat."
