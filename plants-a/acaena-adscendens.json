    "intro": "Acaena adscendens, commonly known as the New Zealand burr bush, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly, bristly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into spherical, woody fruits known as achenes. These fruits are covered in hooked bracts that aid in seed dispersal by attaching to the fur of animals. Acaena adscendens is often found in coastal and inland areas, thriving in well-drained soils.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens is primarily native to South America, specifically Argentina and Chile. It is commonly found in the temperate regions of these countries. This plant thrives in grasslands and shrublands, often in areas with well-drained soils. It is part of the Rosaceae family and is known for its small, spiny fruits. Its distribution is largely limited to the southern parts of South America.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena adscendens was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and growth habit. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native vegetation in certain areas. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types and is particularly common in disturbed or degraded habitats. Its spread has raised concerns among conservationists due to its potential impact on local ecosystems."
