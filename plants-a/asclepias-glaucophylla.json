It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, blue-green coating. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with distinctive, hooded structures that attract various pollinators, including monarch butterflies. Asclepias glaucophylla is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is known for its milky sap, which contains toxic compounds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
