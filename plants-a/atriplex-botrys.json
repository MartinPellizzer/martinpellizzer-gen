    "intro": "Atriplex botrys, commonly known as sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Atriplex botrys is also known for its ability to thrive in saline environments, making it a valuable plant for stabilizing coastal and desert soils."
