    "intro": "Anemone trifolia subsp. lancifolia, commonly known as the lancleaved anemone, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with lance-shaped lobes and produces showy white to pink flowers in late spring. Its flowers are borne on tall, upright stems and are often visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaf lobes compared to the typical form of A. trifolia."
