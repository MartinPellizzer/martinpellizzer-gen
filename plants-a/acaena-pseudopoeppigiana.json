    "intro": "Acaena pseudopoeppigiana, commonly known as the New Zealand bramble, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its prickly stems and small, serrated leaves. The plant produces bright red berries that are an important food source for native birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in coastal and subalpine regions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain areas.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena pseudopoeppigiana is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the eastern and central regions. This species thrives in a variety of habitats, including forests, scrublands, and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with the lower elevations of the Southern Alps. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena pseudopoeppigiana was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as a potential ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and flowering characteristics. However, it has since become invasive, outcompeting native species in various ecosystems. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and can spread rapidly through its seeds. Its distribution is now widespread across much of the North Island and parts of the South Island."
