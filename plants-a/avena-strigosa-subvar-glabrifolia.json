    "intro": "Avena strigosa subvar. glabrifolia, commonly known as the slender oat, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small wildlife."
