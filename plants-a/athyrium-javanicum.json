    "intro": "Athyrium javanicum, commonly known as the Java lady fern, is a perennial fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically arching or cascading, with a light green to bronze coloration. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle in humid conditions."
