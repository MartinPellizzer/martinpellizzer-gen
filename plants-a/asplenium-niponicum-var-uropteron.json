    "intro": "Asplenium niponicum var. uropteron, commonly known as the Japanese spleenwort, is a fern native to East Asia. It is a small, evergreen fern with dark green, leathery leaves that are often used in traditional Japanese gardens. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices or on tree trunks. Its fronds are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments, and it produces spore-bearing clusters on the underside of its leaves. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
