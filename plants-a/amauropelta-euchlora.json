    "intro": "Amauropelta euchlora, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a member of the Pteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically bright yellow to golden in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rainforests or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce dense clusters of foliage, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The leaves are usually leathery and have a waxy surface, which helps the plant retain moisture in humid conditions."
