    "intro": "Armeria canescens, commonly known as sea thrift, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and silvery-gray foliage that helps it withstand salty air and strong winds. The plant produces clusters of white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes, coastal cliffs, and rocky shores. Armeria canescens is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens and as a coastal vegetation stabilizer."
