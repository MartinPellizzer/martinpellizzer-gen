    "intro": "Acantholimon tenuiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered thrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch to its rugged habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water, a characteristic typical of xerophytic plants. Acantholimon tenuiflorum is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience.",

This plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas with well-drained soils. It is adapted to the dry and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Its distribution is limited to specific ecological niches within the Transcaucasus region.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acantholimon tenuiflorum was mainly introduced to regions with dry, rocky soils and a Mediterranean climate. It is commonly found in areas with low rainfall and high sun exposure. This plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. It has been introduced to parts of California and the western United States. However, its spread is limited due to its specific environmental requirements."
