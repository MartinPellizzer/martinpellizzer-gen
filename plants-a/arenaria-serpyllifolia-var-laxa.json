    "intro": "Arenaria serpyllifolia var. laxa, commonly known as loose sandflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to arid or coastal environments. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
