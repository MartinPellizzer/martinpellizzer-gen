    "intro": "Amorphophallus villosus, commonly known as the naked lady or wild calla, is a tropical plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, showy, white, spathaceous flowers that resemble those of the calla lily. The plant produces a large, underground tuber that serves as its primary storage organ. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. The leaves are typically large, heart-shaped, and covered in a fine, hairy texture, giving the plant its common name."
