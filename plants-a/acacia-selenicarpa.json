    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia selenicarpa is primarily native to the arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is commonly found in the Northern Territory, Western Australia, and South Australia. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is well adapted to harsh, dry environments. It is often seen in spinifex grasslands and along coastal dunes. Its distribution is closely linked to areas with low rainfall and high temperatures.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia selenicarpa was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions where it can thrive in well-drained soils. It is commonly found in parts of Australia, where it has been introduced for its ecological and ornamental value. The plant is often used in reforestation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife. However, its introduction has raised concerns about its potential to become invasive in non-native environments. Despite its benefits, careful management is required to prevent unintended ecological impacts."
