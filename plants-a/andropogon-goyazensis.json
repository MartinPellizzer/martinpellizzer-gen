    "intro": "Andropogon goyazensis, commonly known as Goyazensis grass, is a tall, perennial grass native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its sturdy, erect growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones and open woodlands. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
