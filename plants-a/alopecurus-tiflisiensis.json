    "intro": "Alopecurus tiflisiensis, commonly known as the Tiflis hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slight hairy texture, giving it its common name. Alopecurus tiflisiensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
