    "intro": "Aspidium brachyodus, commonly known as the broad-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate regions. Aspidium brachyodus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
