    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia websteri is primarily native to Western Australia. It is found in the southern and western regions of the state, particularly in the areas of the Fitzgerald River National Park and the Perth region. This plant typically grows in sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It is well adapted to the dry and arid conditions of its native habitat. Acacia websteri is an important part of the local flora and contributes to the ecological diversity of Western Australia.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia websteri was mainly introduced to areas with arid or semi-arid climates, particularly in regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping and erosion control. The plant is known for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, which contributes to its successful establishment in introduced habitats. It has been used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardy nature. However, its invasive potential in some areas has raised concerns about its ecological impact."
