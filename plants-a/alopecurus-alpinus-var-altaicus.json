    "intro": "Alopecurus alpinus var. altaicus, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted leaves and small, blue-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high elevations, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize soil in harsh alpine environments. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in mountainous areas."
