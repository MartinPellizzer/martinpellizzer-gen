    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Abutilon reticulatum is primarily native to Southeast Asia, including countries such as India, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia. It is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in areas with warm, humid climates. This plant thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or loamy soils. It is also present in parts of Australia and the Pacific Islands. Its natural range extends across various parts of the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Abutilon reticulatum was mainly introduced to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It was brought there as an ornamental plant due to its attractive, lantern-shaped flowers. The plant has since become naturalized in wetland and riparian areas, spreading along riverbanks and disturbed sites. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist conditions have led to its classification as an invasive species in some regions. However, it is also valued for its ecological benefits, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
