    "intro": "Arrhenatherum elatius subsp. bulbosum, commonly known as bulbous false oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, marshes, and wetlands, thriving in damp, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green color, and it has distinctive bulbous rhizomes that contribute to its spreading growth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
