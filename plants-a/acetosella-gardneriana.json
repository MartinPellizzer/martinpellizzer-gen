    "intro": "Acetosella gardneriana, commonly known as Gardner's sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the Primulaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, and is often found in areas with rich, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions.",
