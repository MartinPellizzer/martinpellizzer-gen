    "intro": "Acaena ovalifolia var. calophylla, commonly known as the New Zealand spinach or the \"k\u014dwhai\" in M\u0101ori, is a low-growing shrub native to New Zealand. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by spherical, spiky fruits that contain seeds. It is well adapted to coastal and inland environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional M\u0101ori practices.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. calophylla is primarily native to New Zealand. It is found in the South Island, particularly in the region of Canterbury. This variety thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It is commonly associated with coastal and inland dunes. The plant is well adapted to the temperate climate and nutrient-poor soils of its native range.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acaena ovalifolia var. calophylla was mainly introduced to New Zealand. It was brought there as part of the European flora during the early colonial period. The plant has since become naturalized in various regions of the country. It is commonly found in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in disturbed soils. Its introduction has led to its establishment in both natural and cultivated environments."
