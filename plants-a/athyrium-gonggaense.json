    "intro": "Athyrium gonggaense, commonly known as the Gongga Athyrium, is a fern species native to the high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the family Athyriaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Athyrium gonggaense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
