    "intro": "Aechmea martinicensis, commonly known as the Martinique bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the Caribbean. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. The plant's leaves are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and may have red or purple hues along the margins. It produces striking inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. Aechmea martinicensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests."
