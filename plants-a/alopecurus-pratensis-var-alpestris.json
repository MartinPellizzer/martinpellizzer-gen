    "intro": "Alopecurus pratensis var. alpestris, commonly known as alpine meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, soft blades that are often used in lawns and pastures. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
