    "intro": "Asplenium martianum, commonly known as the Martian spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial fern belonging to the Aspleniaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, evergreen foliage with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that often have a waxy coating. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, a typical feature of ferns. Asplenium martianum is a primitive vascular plant with a simple structure, reflecting its ancient lineage."
