    "intro": "Artemisia ludoviciana subsp. candicans, commonly known as silverleaf sage, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, dense hairs that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
