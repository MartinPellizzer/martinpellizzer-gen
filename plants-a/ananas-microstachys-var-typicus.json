It produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to pineapples but have a sweeter, more delicate flavor. The plant has a short, upright stem with broad, waxy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. The fruit is typically harvested when it turns yellow and emits a fragrant aroma."
