    "intro": "Ateleste tristis, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically slender and pointed, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. It thrives in moist environments, often found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing fruits."
