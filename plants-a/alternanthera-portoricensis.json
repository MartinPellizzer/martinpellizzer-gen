    "intro": "Alternanthera portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican Alternanthera, is a herbaceous plant native to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage, which becomes more intense under full sun exposure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
