    "intro": "Aspidium rivularioides, commonly known as the water fern, is a member of the family Pteridaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest floors. The plant has a creeping rhizome with dense, overlapping fronds that are usually dark green and glossy. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a characteristic feature of ferns. Aspidium rivularioides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
