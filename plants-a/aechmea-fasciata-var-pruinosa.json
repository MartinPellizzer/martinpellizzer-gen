It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, powdery bloom, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces a tall, branched inflorescence that bears showy, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. Its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in its native humid environments. The species is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
