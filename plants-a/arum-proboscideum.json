    "intro": "Arum proboscideum, commonly known as the giant arrowhead, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that can grow up to three meters in length, often with a glossy, dark green surface. The plant produces a striking inflorescence consisting of a spadix surrounded by a showy, petal-like spathe. Its unique structure is adapted for attracting pollinators such as bats and insects. Arum proboscideum is also known for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
