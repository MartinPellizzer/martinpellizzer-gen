    "intro": "Adiantum rollandiae, commonly known as the Rolland's maidenhair fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Adiantaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bi- or tri-pinnate. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Adiantum rollandiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant.",
