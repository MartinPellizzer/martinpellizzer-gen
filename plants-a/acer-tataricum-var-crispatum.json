    "intro": "Acer tataricum var. crispatum, commonly known as the curly-leaf maple, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 meters, with a rounded or spreading crown. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, appearing in early spring before the leaves unfold. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value.",
