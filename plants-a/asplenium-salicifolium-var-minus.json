    "intro": "Asplenium salicifolium var. minus, commonly known as the small willow fern, is a variant of the willow fern species native to various regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are wiry and form dense clumps, contributing to its ability to colonize and stabilize soil in its habitat. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of the Asplenium genus."
