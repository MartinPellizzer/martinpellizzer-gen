It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its growth habit and ecological role make it an important species in native plant communities."
