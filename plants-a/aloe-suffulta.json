    "intro": "Aloe suffulta, commonly known as the rock aloe, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the edges. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with yellow flowers, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Aloe suffulta is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its gel is less commonly used compared to other aloe species."
