    "intro": "Aspidium phaeostigma, commonly known as the black-stained water fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Athyriaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including countries like India, China, and Japan. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery fronds that are typically pinnately divided. Its spores are produced in sori that are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Aspidium phaeostigma is often found in rocky or forested areas, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
