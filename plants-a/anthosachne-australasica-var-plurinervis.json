It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and swamps, and is adapted to waterlogged soils. Its leaves are usually broad and flat, with prominent veins, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. This variety is distinguished by its multiple nerves on the leaf blades, which contribute to its scientific name."
