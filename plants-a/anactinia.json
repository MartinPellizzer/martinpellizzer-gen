    "intro": "Anactinia, commonly known as the sea anemone, is a marine cnidarian belonging to the class Anthozoa. It lacks a true medusa stage and exists primarily as a polyp, typically found attached to substrates in shallow waters. Anactinia species have a central gastrovascular cavity surrounded by tentacles used for capturing prey. Their body structure includes a flexible oral disc with numerous tentacles and a basal pedal disc for attachment. These organisms play a vital role in marine ecosystems by providing habitat and serving as a food source for various marine animals."
