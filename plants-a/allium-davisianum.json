    "intro": "Allium davisianum, commonly known as the Davis onion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white or pale purple flowers. The plant produces bulbous structures that serve as storage organs for nutrients, typical of many Allium species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential culinary uses, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
