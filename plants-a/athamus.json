    "intro": "Athamus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their thick, fleshy stems and large, showy leaves that often resemble those of other ornamental plants. The flowers are typically clustered in a spadix, enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe, which is a common feature in the Araceae family. Athamus species are native to various regions in Africa and are often found in woodland or moist habitats. Due to their toxicity, they should be handled with care and are not recommended for cultivation in home gardens."
