    "intro": "Arabis kaynakiae, commonly known as the Kaynak's rockcress, is a flowering plant native to Turkey. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
