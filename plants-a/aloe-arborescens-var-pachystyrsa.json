It features a branched, tree-like structure with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with red or yellow margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves contain a gel-like substance that is used in traditional medicine and skincare products. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid environments."
