    "intro": "Acacia cycnorum var. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved white acacia, is a shrub native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and small, pinnate leaves composed of numerous fine, needle-like leaflets. The plant produces yellow, globular flower heads that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky soils. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine.",

    "distribution_native_art_desc": "Acacia cycnorum var. minutifolia is primarily native to the Indian subcontinent, including countries such as India, Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in dry, arid, and semi-arid regions, often found in wastelands, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. This variety is well adapted to poor soils and can tolerate high temperatures and low rainfall. It is commonly seen in regions with a tropical and subtropical climate. Due to its hardy nature, it is also found in some parts of Australia and has been introduced to other parts of the world.",
    "distribution_introduced_art_desc": "Acacia cycnorum var. minutifolia was mainly introduced to areas where it can thrive in arid and semi-arid environments, often as an ornamental or for its nitrogen-fixing properties. It has been reported in parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, where it has become naturalized. The plant is commonly found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in degraded habitats. Its introduction has raised concerns due to its potential to become invasive in certain ecosystems. However, it is generally considered a minor weed with limited ecological impact compared to other Acacia species."
